heart the other eye doth see Ah poor our sex this fault in us I find The error of our eye directs our mind What error leads must err O then conclude Minds sway'd by eyes are full of turpitudeA proof of strength she could not publish more Unless she said 'My mind is now turn'd whore'All's done my lordIt isWhy stay we thenTo make a recordation to my soul Of every syllable that here was spoke But if I tell how these two did coact Shall I not lie in publishing a truth Sith yet there is a credence in my heart An esperance so obstinately strong That doth invert th' attest of eyes and ears As if those organs had deceptious functions Created only to calumniate Was Cressid hereI cannot conjure TroyanShe was not sureMost sure she wasWhy my negation hath no taste of madnessNor mine my lord Cressid was here but nowLet it not be believ'd for womanhood Think we had mothers do not give advantage To stubborn critics apt without a theme For depravation to square the general sex By Cressid's rule Rather think this not CressidWhat hath she done Prince that can soil our mothersNothing at all unless that this were sheWill 'a swagger himself out on's own eyesThis she No this is Diomed's Cressida If beauty have a soul this is not she If souls guide vows if vows be sanctimonies If sanctimony be the god's delight If there be rule in unity itself This was not she O madness of discourse That cause sets up with and against itself Bifold authority where reason can revolt Without perdition and loss assume all reason Without revolt this is and is not Cressid Within my soul there doth conduce a fight Of this strange nature that a thing inseparate Divides more wider than the sky and earth And yet the spacious breadth of this division Admits no orifex for a point as subtle As Ariachne's broken woof toInstance O instance strong as Pluto's gates Cressid is mine tied with the bonds of heaven Instance O instance strong as heaven itself The bonds of heaven are slipp'd dissolv'd and loos'd And with another knot fivefingertied The fractions of her faith orts of her love The fragments scraps the bits and greasy relics Of her o'ereaten faith are bound to DiomedMay worthy Troilus be halfattach'd With that which here his passion doth expressAy Greek and that shall be divulged well In characters as red as Mars his heart Inflam'd with Venus Never did young man fancy With so eternal and so fix'd a soul Hark Greek as much as I do Cressid love So much by weight hate I her Diomed That sleeve is mine that he'll bear on his helm Were it a casque compos'd by Vulcan's skill My sword should bite it Not the dreadful spout Which shipmen do the hurricano call Constring'd in mass by the almighty sun Shall dizzy with more clamour Neptune's ear In his descent than shall my prompted sword Falling on DiomedHe'll tickle it for his concupyO Cressid O false Cressid false false false Let all untruths stand by thy stained name And they'll seem gloriousO contain yourself Your passion draws ears hither I have been seeking you this hour my lord Hector by this is arming him in Troy Ajax your guard stays to conduct you homeHave with you Prince My courteous lord adieu Fairwell revolted fairand Diomed Stand fast and wear a castle on thy headI'll bring you to the gatesAccept distracted thanksand Would I could meet that rogue Diomed I would croak like a raven I would bode I would bode Patroclus will give me anything for the intelligence of this whore the parrot will not do more for an almond than he for a commodious drab Lechery lechery Still wars and lechery Nothing else holds fashion A burning devil take them Troy Beforepalaceand When was my lord so much ungently temper'd To stop his ears against admonishment Unarm unarm and do not fight todayYou train me to offend you get you in By all the everlasting gods I'll goMy dreams will sure prove ominous to the dayNo more I sayWhere is my brother HectorHere sister arm'd and bloody in intent Consort with me in loud and dear petition Pursue we him on knees for I have dreamt Of bloody turbulence and this whole night Hath nothing been but shapes and forms of slaughterO 'tis trueHo bid my trumpet soundNo notes of sally for the heavens sweet brotherBe gone I say The gods have heard me swearThe gods are deaf to hot and peevish vows They are polluted off'rings more abhorr'd Than spotted livers in the sacrificeO be persuaded Do not count it holy To hurt by being just It is as lawful For we would give much to use violent thefts And rob in the behalf of charityIt is the purpose that makes strong the vow But vows to every purpose must not hold Unarm sweet HectorHold you still I say Mine honour keeps the weather of my fate Life every man holds dear but the dear man Holds honour far more precious dear than life How now young man Mean'st thou to fight todayCassandra call my father to persuade No faith young Troilus doff thy harness youth I am today i' th' vein of chivalry Let grow thy sinews till their knots be strong And tempt not yet the brushes of the war Unarm thee go and doubt thou not brave boy I'll stand today for thee and me and TroyBrother you have a vice of mercy in you Which better fits a lion than a manWhat vice is that good Troilus Chide me for itWhen many times the captive Grecian falls Even in the fan and wind of your fair sword You bid them rise and liveO 'tis fair playFool's play by heaven HectorHow now how nowFor th' love of all the gods Let's leave the hermit Pity with our mother And when we have our armours buckled on The venom'd vengeance ride upon our swords Spur them to ruthful work rein them from ruthFie savage fieHector then 'tis warsTroilus I would not have you fight todayWho should withhold me Not fate obedience nor the hand of Mars Beck'ning with fiery truncheon my retire Not Priamus and Hecuba on knees Their eyes o'ergalled with recourse of tears Nor you my brother with your true sword drawn Oppos'd to hinder me should stop my way But by my ruin Rewith Lay hold upon him Priam hold him fast He is thy crutch now if thou lose thy stay Thou on him leaning and all Troy on thee Fall all togetherCome Hector come go back Thy wife hath dreamt thy mother hath had visions Cassandra doth foresee and I myself Am like a prophet suddenly enrapt To tell thee that this day is ominous Therefore come backAeneas is afield And I do stand engag'd to many Greeks Even in the faith of valour to appear This morning to themAy but thou shalt not goI must not break my faith You know me dutiful therefore dear sir Let me not shame respect but give me leave To take that course by your consent and voice Which you do here forbid me royal PriamO Priam yield not to himDo not dear fatherAndromache I am offended with you Upon the love you bear me get you inThis foolish dreaming superstitious girl Makes all these bodementsO farewell dear Hector Look how thou diest Look how thy eye turns pale Look how thy wounds do bleed at many vents Hark how Troy roars how Hecuba cries out How poor Andromache shrills her dolours forth Behold distraction frenzy and amazement Like witless antics one another meet And all cry Hector Hector's dead O HectorAway awayFarewellyet soft Hector I take my leave Thou dost thyself and all our Troy deceiveYou are amaz'd my liege at her exclaim Go in and cheer the town we'll forth and fight Do deeds worth praise and

shall leave you one o' th's days and I have a rheum in mine eyes too and such an ache in my bones that unless a man were curs'd I cannot tell what to think on't What says she thereWords words mere words no matter from the heart Th' effect doth operate another wayTearing the letter Go wind to wind there turn and change together My love with words and errors still she feeds But edifies another with her deeds severallyThe plain between Troy and the Grecian camp ExcursionsNow they are clapperclawing one another I'll go look on That dissembling abominable varlet Diomed has got that same scurvy doting foolish young knave's sleeve of Troy there in his helm I would fain see them meet that that same young Troyan ass that loves the whore there might send that Greekish whoremasterly villain with the sleeve back to the dissembling luxurious drab of a sleeveless errand A th' t'other side the policy of those crafty swearing rascalsthat stale old mouseeaten dry cheese Nestor and that same dogfox Ulysses is not prov'd worth a blackberry They set me up in policy that mongrel cur Ajax against that dog of as bad a kind Achilles and now is the cur Ajax prouder than the cur Achilles and will not arm today whereupon the Grecians begin to proclaim barbarism and policy grows into an ill opinionfollowing Soft here comes sleeve and t'otherFly not for shouldst thou take the river Styx I would swim
