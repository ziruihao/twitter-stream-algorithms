fears in Banquo Stick deep and in his royalty of nature Reigns that which would be fear'd 'Tis much he dares And to that dauntless temper of his mind He hath a wisdom that doth guide his valor To act in safety There is none but he Whose being I do fear and under him My genius is rebuked as it is said Mark Antony's was by Caesar He chid the sisters When first they put the name of King upon me And bade them speak to him then prophetlike They hail'd him father to a line of kings Upon my head they placed a fruitless crown And put a barren sceptre in my gripe Thence to be wrench'd with an unlineal hand No son of mine succeeding If't be so For Banquo's issue have I filed my mind For them the gracious Duncan have I murther'd Put rancors in the vessel of my peace Only for them and mine eternal jewel Given to the common enemy of man To make them kings the seed of Banquo kings Rather than so come Fate into the list And champion me to the utterance Who's there Re Attendant with two Murtherers Now go to the door and stay there till we call Attendant Was it not yesterday we spoke togetherIt was so please your HighnessWell then now Have you consider'd of my speeches Know That it was he in the times past which held you So under fortune which you thought had been Our innocent self This I made good to you In our last conference pass'd in probation with you How you were borne in hand how cross'd the instruments Who wrought with them and all things else that might To half a soul and to a notion crazed Say Thus did BanquoYou made it known to usI did so and went further which is now Our point of second meeting Do you find Your patience so predominant in your nature That you can let this go Are you so gospel'd To pray for this good man and for his issue Whose heavy hand hath bow'd you to the grave And beggar'd yours foreverWe are men my liegeAy in the catalogue ye go for men As hounds and greyhounds mongrels spaniels curs Shoughs waterrugs and demiwolves are clept All by the name of dogs The valued file Distinguishes the swift the slow the subtle The housekeeper the hunter every one According to the gift which bounteous nature Hath in him closed whereby he does receive Particular addition from the bill That writes them all alike and so of men Now if you have a station in the file Not i' the worst rank of manhood say it And I will put that business in your bosoms Whose execution takes your enemy off Grapples you to the heart and love of us Who wear our health but sickly in his life Which in his death were perfectI am one my liege Whom the vile blows and buffets of the world Have so incensed that I am reckless what I do to spite the worldAnd I another So weary with disasters tugg'd with fortune That I would set my life on any chance To mend it or be rid on'tBoth of you Know Banquo was your enemyTrue my lordSo is he mine and in such bloody distance That every minute of his being thrusts Against my near'st of life and though I could With barefaced power sweep him from my sight And bid my will avouch it yet I must not For certain friends that are both his and mine Whose loves I may not drop but wail his fall Who I myself struck down And thence it is That I to your assistance do make love Masking the business from the common eye For sundry weighty reasonsWe shall my lord Perform what you command usThough our livesYour spirits shine through you Within this hour at most I will advise you where to plant yourselves Acquaint you with the perfect spy o' the time The moment on't fort must be done tonight And something from the palace always thought That I require a clearness and with him To leave no rubs nor botches in the work Fleance his son that keeps him company Whose absence is no less material to me Than is his father's must embrace the fate Of that dark hour Resolve yourselves apart I'll come to you anonWe are resolved my lordI'll call upon you straight Abide withinMurtherers It is concluded Banquo thy soul's flight If it find heaven must find it out tonight The palaceLady Macbeth and a ServantIs Banquo gone from courtAy madam but returns again tonightSay to the King I would attend his leisure For a few wordsMadam I willNought's had all's spent Where our desire is got without content 'Tis safer to be that which we destroy Than by destruction dwell in doubtful joyMacbeth How now my lord Why do you keep alone Of sorriest fancies your companions making Using those thoughts which should indeed have died With them they think on Things without all remedy Should be without regard What's done is doneWe have scotch'd the snake not kill'd it She'll close and be herself whilst our poor malice Remains in danger of her former tooth But let the frame of things disjoint both the worlds suffer Ere we will eat our meal in fear and sleep In the affliction of these terrible dreams That shake us nightly Better be with the dead Whom we to gain our peace have sent to peace Than on the torture of the mind to lie In restless ecstasy Duncan is in his grave After life's fitful fever he sleeps well Treason has done his worst nor steel nor poison Malice domestic foreign levy nothing Can touch him furtherCome on Gentle my lord sleek o'er your rugged looks Be bright and jovial among your guests tonightSo shall I love and so I pray be you Let your remembrance apply to Banquo Present him eminence both with eye and tongue Unsafe the while that we Must lave our honors in these flattering streams And make our faces vizards to our hearts Disguising what they areYou must leave thisO full of scorpions is my mind dear wife Thou know'st that Banquo and his Fleance livesBut in them nature's copy's not eterneThere's comfort yet they are assailable Then be thou jocund Ere the bat hath flown His cloister'd flight ere to black Hecate's summons The shardborne beetle with his drowsy hums Hath rung night's yawning peal there shall be done A deed of dreadful noteWhat's to be doneBe innocent of the knowledge dearest chuck Till thou applaud the deed Come seeling night Scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day And with thy bloody and invisible hand Cancel and tear to pieces that great bond Which keeps me pale Light thickens and the crow Makes wing to the rooky wood Good things of day begin to droop and drowse Whiles night's black agents to their preys do rouse Thou marvel'st at my words but hold thee still Things bad begun make strong themselves by ill So prithee go with me A park near the palacethree MurtherersBut who did bid thee join with usMacbethHe needs not our mistrust since he delivers Our offices and what we have to do To the direction justThen stand with us The west yet glimmers with some streaks of day Now spurs the lated traveler apace To gain the timely inn and near approaches The subject of our watchHark I hear horsesWithin Give us a light there hoThen 'tis he the rest That are within the note of expectation Already are i' the courtHis horses go aboutAlmost a mile but he does

perfect Whole as the marble founded as the rock As broad and general as the casing air But now I am cabin'd cribb'd confin'd bound in To saucy doubts and fears But Banquo's safeAy my good lord Safe in

notAre you a manAy and a bold one that dare look on that Which might appal the devilO proper stuff This is the very painting of your fear This is the airdrawn dagger which you said Led you to Duncan O these flaws and starts Impostors to true fear would well become A woman's story at a winter's fire Authorized by her grandam Shame itself Why do you make such faces When all's done You look but on a stoolPrithee see there Behold Look Lo How say you Why what care I If thou canst nod speak too If charnel houses and our graves must send Those that we bury back our monuments Shall be the maws of kites GhostWhat quite unmann'd in follyIf I stand here I saw himFie for shameBlood hath been shed ere now i' the olden time Ere humane statute purged the gentle weal Ay and since too murthers have been perform'd Too terrible for the ear The time has been That when the brains were out the man would die And there an end but now they rise again With twenty mortal murthers on their crowns And push us from our stools This is more strange Than such a murther isMy worthy lord Your noble friends do lack youI do forget Do not muse at me my most worthy friends I have a strange infirmity which is nothing To those that know me Come love and health to all Then I'll sit down Give me some wine fill full I drink to the general joy o' the whole table And to our dear friend Banquo whom we miss Would he were here To all and him we thirst And all to allOur duties and the pledgeRe GhostAvaunt and quit my sight Let the earth hide thee Thy bones are marrowless thy blood is cold Thou hast no speculation in those eyes Which thou dost glare withThink of this good peers But as a thing of custom 'Tis no other Only it spoils the pleasure of the timeWhat man dare I dare Approach thou like the rugged Russian bear The arm'd rhinoceros or the Hyrcan tiger Take any shape but that and my firm nerves Shall never tremble Or be alive again And dare me to the desert with thy sword If trembling I inhabit then protest me The baby of a girl Hence horrible shadow Unreal mockery henceGhost Why so being gone I am a man again Pray you sit stillYou have displaced the mirth broke the good meeting With most admired disorderCan such things be And overcome us like a summer's cloud Without our special wonder You make me strange Even to the disposition that I owe When now I think you can behold such sights And keep the natural ruby of your cheeks When mine is blanch'd with fearWhat sights my lordI pray you speak not he grows worse and worse Question enrages him At once good night Stand not upon the order of your going But go at onceGood night and better health Attend his MajestyA kind good night to allall but Macbeth and Lady Macbethwill have blood they say blood will have blood Stones have been known to move and trees to speak Augures and understood relations have By maggot pies and choughs and rooks brought forth The secret'st man of blood What is the nightAlmost at odds with morning which is whichHow say'st thou that Macduff denies his person At our great biddingDid you send to him sirI hear it by the way but I will send There's not a one of them but in his house I keep a servant feed I will tomorrow And betimes I will to the weird sisters More shall they speak for now I am bent to know By the worst means the worst For mine own good All causes shall give way I am in blood Stepp'd in so far that should I wade no more Returning were as tedious as go o'er Strange things I have in head that will to hand Which must be acted ere they may be scann'dYou lack the season of all natures sleepCome we'll to sleep My strange and selfabuse Is the initiate fear that wants hard use We are yet but young in deed A heath Thunderthe three Witches meeting HecateWhy how now Hecate You look angerlyHave I not reason beldams as you are Saucy and overbold How did you dare To trade and traffic with Macbeth In riddles and affairs of death And I the mistress of your charms The close contriver of all harms Was never call'd to bear my part Or show the glory of our art And which is worse all you have done Hath been but for a wayward son Spiteful and wrathful who as others do Loves for his own ends not for you But make amends now Get you gone And at the pit of Acheron Meet me i' the morning Thither he Will come to know his destiny Your vessels and your spells provide Your charms and everything beside I am for the air this night I'll spend Unto a dismal and a fatal end Great business must be wrought ere noon Upon the corner of the moon There hangs a vaporous drop profound I'll catch it ere it come to ground And that distill'd by magic sleights Shall raise such artificial sprites As by the strength of their illusion Shall draw him on to his confusion He shall spurn fate scorn death and bear His hopes 'bove wisdom grace and fear And you all know security Is mortals' chiefest enemy Music and a song withinCome away come away Hark I am call'd my little spirit see Sits in a foggy cloud and stays for meCome let's make haste she'll soon be back againForres The palaceLennox and another LordMy former speeches have but hit your thoughts Which can interpret farther only I say Thing's have been strangely borne The gracious Duncan Was pitied of Macbeth marry he was dead And the right valiant Banquo walk'd too late Whom you may say if't please you Fleance kill'd For Fleance fled Men must not walk too late Who cannot want the thought how monstrous It was for Malcolm and for Donalbain To kill their gracious father Damned fact How it did grieve Macbeth Did he not straight In pious rage the two delinquents tear That were the slaves of drink and thralls of sleep Was not that nobly done Ay and wisely too For 'twould have anger'd any heart alive To hear the men deny't So that I say He has borne all things well and I do think That had he Duncan's sons under his key As an't please heaven he shall not they should find What 'twere to kill a father so should Fleance But peace For from broad words and 'cause he fail'd His presence at the tyrant's feast I hear Macduff lives in disgrace Sir can you tell Where he bestows himselfThe son of Duncan From whom this tyrant holds the due of birth Lives in the English court and is received Of the most pious Edward with such grace That the malevolence of fortune nothing Takes from his high respect Thither Macduff Is gone to pray the holy King upon his aid To wake Northumberland and warlike Siward That by the help of these with Him above To ratify the work we may again Give to our tables meat sleep to our nights Free from our feasts and banquets bloody knives Do faithful homage and receive free honors All which we pine for now And this report Hath so exasperate the King that he Prepares for some attempt of warSent he to MacduffHe did and with an absolute Sir not I The cloudy messenger turns me his back And hums as who should say You'll rue the time That clogs me with this answerAnd that well might Advise him to a caution to hold what distance His wisdom can provide Some holy angel Fly to the court of England and unfold His message ere he come that a swift blessing May soon return to this our suffering country Under a hand accursedI'll send my prayers with him
