 England and Wales London The palace with other and attendantsOld John of Gaunt timehonoured Lancaster Hast thou according to thy oath and band Brought hither Henry Hereford thy bold son Here to make good the boist'rous late appeal Which then our leisure would not let us hear Against the Duke of Norfolk Thomas MowbrayI have my liegeTell me moreover hast thou sounded him If he appeal the Duke on ancient malice Or worthily as a good subject should On some known ground of treachery in himAs near as I could sift him on that argument On some apparent danger seen in him Aim'd at your Highnessno inveterate maliceThen call them to our presence face to face And frowning brow to brow ourselves will hear The accuser and the accused freely speak Highstomach'd are they both and full of ire In rage deaf as the sea hasty as fire and Many years of happy days befall My gracious sovereign my most loving liegeEach day still better other's happiness Until the heavens envying earth's good hap Add an immortal title to your crownWe thank you both yet one but flatters us As well appeareth by the cause you come Namely to appeal each other of high treason Cousin of Hereford what dost thou object Against the Duke of Norfolk Thomas MowbrayFirstheaven be the record to my speech In the devotion of a subject's love Tend'ring the precious safety of my prince And free from other misbegotten hate Come I appellant to this princely presence Now Thomas Mowbray do I turn to thee And mark my greeting well for what I speak My body shall make good upon this earth Or my divine soul answer it in heaven Thou art a traitor and a miscreant Too good to be so and too bad to live Since the more fair and crystal is the sky The uglier seem the clouds that in it fly Once more the more to aggravate the note With a foul traitor's name stuff I thy throat And wishso please my sovereignere I move What my tongue speaks my right drawn sword may proveLet not my cold words here accuse my zeal 'Tis not the trial of a woman's war The bitter clamour of two eager tongues Can arbitrate this cause betwixt us twain The blood is hot that must be cool'd for this Yet can I not of such tame patience boast As to be hush'd and nought at an to say First the fair reverence of your Highness curbs me From giving reins and spurs to my free speech Which else would post until it had return'd These terms of treason doubled down his throat Setting aside his high blood's royalty And let him be no kinsman to my liege I do defy him and I spit at him Call him a slanderous coward and a villain Which to maintain I would allow him odds And meet him were I tied to run afoot Even to the frozen ridges of the Alps Or any other ground inhabitable Where ever Englishman durst set his foot Meantime let this defend my loyalty By all my hopes most falsely doth he liePale trembling coward there I throw my gage Disclaiming here the kindred of the King And lay aside my high blood's royalty Which fear not reverence makes thee to except If guilty dread have left thee so much strength As to take up mine honour's pawn then stoop By that and all the rites of knighthood else Will I make good against thee arm to arm What I have spoke or thou canst worst deviseI take it up and by that sword I swear Which gently laid my knighthood on my shoulder I'll answer thee in any fair degree Or chivalrous design of knightly trial And when I mount alive may I not light If I be traitor or unjustly fightWhat doth our cousin lay to Mowbray's charge It must be great that can inherit us So much as of a thought of ill in himLook what I speak my life shall prove it true That Mowbray hath receiv'd eight thousand nobles In name of lendings for your Highness' soldiers The which he hath detain'd for lewd employments Like a false traitor and injurious villain Besides I say and will in battle prove Or here or elsewhere to the furthest verge That ever was survey'd by English eye That all the treasons for these eighteen years Complotted and contrived in this land Fetch from false Mowbray their first head and spring Further I say and further will maintain Upon his bad life to make all this good That he did plot the Duke of Gloucester's death Suggest his soonbelieving adversaries And consequently like a traitor coward Sluic'd out his innocent soul through streams of blood Which blood like sacrificing Abel's cries Even from the tongueless caverns of the earth To me for justice and rough chastisement And by the glorious worth of my descent This arm shall do it or this life be spentHow high a pitch his resolution soars Thomas of Norfolk what say'st thou to thisO let my sovereign turn away his face And bid his ears a little while be deaf Till I have told this slander of his blood How God and good men hate so foul a liarMowbray impartial are our eyes and cars Were he my brother nay my kingdom's heir As he is but my father's brother's son Now by my sceptre's awe I make a vow Such neighbour nearness to our sacred blood Should nothing privilege him nor partialize The unstooping firmness of my upright soul He is our subject Mowbray so art thou Free speech and fearless I to thee allowThen Bolingbroke as low as to thy heart Through the false passage of thy throat thou liest Three parts of that receipt I had for Calais Disburs'd I duly to his Highness' soldiers The other part reserv'd I by consent For that my sovereign liege was in my debt Upon remainder of a dear account Since last I went to France to fetch his queen Now swallow down that lie For Gloucester's death I slew him not but to my own disgrace Neglected my sworn duty in that case For you my noble Lord of Lancaster The honourable father to my foe Once did I lay an ambush for your life A trespass that doth vex my grieved soul But ere I last receiv'd the sacrament I did confess it and exactly begg'd Your Grace's pardon and I hope I had it This is my fault As for the rest appeal'd It issues from the rancour of a villain A recreant and most degenerate traitor Which in myself I boldly will defend And interchangeably hurl down my gage Upon this overweening traitor's foot To prove myself a loyal gentleman Even in the best blood chamber'd in his bosom In haste whereof most heartily I pray Your Highness to assign our trial dayWrathkindled gentlemen be rul'd by me Let's purge this choler without letting blood This we prescribe though no physician Deep malice makes too deep incision Forget forgive conclude and be agreed Our doctors say this is no month to bleed Good uncle let this end where it begun We'll calm the Duke of Norfolk you your sonTo be a makepeace shall become my age Throw down my son the Duke of Norfolk's gageAnd Norfolk throw down hisWhen Harry when Obedience bids I should not bid againNorfolk throw down we bid There is no bootMyself I throw dread sovereign at thy foot My life thou shalt command but not my shame The one my duty owes but my fair name Despite of death that lives upon my grave To dark dishonour's use thou shalt not have I am disgrac'd impeach'd and baffl'd here Pierc'd to the soul with slander's venom'd spear The which no balm can cure but his heartblood Which breath'd this poisonRage must be withstood Give me his gagelions make leopards tameYea but not change his spots Take but my shame And I resign my gage My dear dear lord The purest treasure mortal times afford Is spotless reputation that away Men are but gilded loam or painted clay A jewel in a tentimes barr'dup chest Is a bold spirit in a loyal breast Mine honour is my life both grow in one Take honour from me and my life is done Then dear my liege mine honour let me try In that I live and for that will I dieCousin throw up your gage do you beginO God defend my soul from such deep sin Shall I seem crestfallen in my father's sight Or with pale beggarfear impeach my height Before this outdar'd dastard Ere my tongue Shall wound my honour with such feeble wrong Or sound so base a parle my teeth shall tear The slavish motive of recanting fear And spit it bleeding in his high disgrace Where shame doth harbour even in Mowbray's faceWe were not born to sue but to command Which since we cannot do to make you friends Be ready as your lives shall answer it At Coventry upon Saint Lambert's day There shall your swords and lances arbitrate The swelling difference of your settled hate Since we can not atone you we shall see Justice design the victor's chivalry Lord Marshal command our officersatarms Be ready to direct these home alarmsLondon The palace with theAlas the part I had in Woodstock's blood Doth more solicit me than your exclaims To stir against the butchers of his life But since correction lieth in those hands Which made the fault that we cannot correct Put we our quarrel to the will of heaven Who when they see the hours ripe on earth Will rain hot vengeance on offenders' headsFinds brotherhood in thee no sharper spur Hath love in thy old blood no living fire Edward's seven sons whereof thyself art one Were as seven vials of his sacred blood Or seven fair branches springing from one root Some of those seven are dried by nature's course Some of those branches by the Destinies cut But Thomas my dear lord my life my Gloucester One vial full of Edward's sacred blood One flourishing branch of his most royal root Is crack'd and all the precious liquor spilt Is hack'd down and his summer leaves all faded By envy's hand and murder's bloody axe Ah Gaunt his blood was thine That bed that womb That mettle that self mould that fashion'd thee Made him a man and though thou livest and breathest Yet art thou slain in him Thou dost consent In some large measure to thy father's death In that thou seest thy wretched brother die Who was the model of thy father's life Call it not patience Gauntit is despair In suff'ring thus thy brother to be slaught'red Thou showest the naked pathway to thy life Teaching stern murder how to butcher thee That which in mean men we entitle patience Is pale cold cowardice in noble breasts What shall I say To safeguard thine own life The best way is to venge my Gloucester's deathGod's is the quarrel for God's substitute His deputy anointed in His sight Hath caus'd his death the which if wrongfully Let heaven revenge for I may never lift An angry arm against His ministerWhere then alas may I complain myselfTo God the widow's champion and defenceWhy then I will Farewell old Gaunt Thou goest to Coventry there to behold Our cousin Hereford and fell Mowbray fight O sit my husband's wrongs on Hereford's spear That it

caitiff recreant to my cousin Hereford Farewell old Gaunt thy sometimes brother's wife With her companion Grief must end her lifeSister farewell I must to Coventry As much good stay with thee as go

return these dukes what we decree A long flourish while the consults his Council Draw near And list what with our council we have done For that our kingdom's earth should not be soil'd With that dear blood which it hath fostered And for our eyes do hate the dire aspect Of civil wounds plough'd up with neighbours' sword And for we think the eaglewinged pride Of skyaspiring and ambitious thoughts With rivalhating envy set on you To wake our peace which in our country's cradle Draws the sweet infant breath of gentle sleep Which so rous'd up with boist'rous untun'd drums With harshresounding trumpets' dreadful bray And grating shock of wrathful iron arms Might from our quiet confines fright fair peace And make us wade even in our kindred's blood Therefore we banish you our territories You cousin Hereford upon pain of life Till twice five summers have enrich'd our fields Shall not regreet our fair dominions But tread the stranger paths of banishmentYour will be done This must my comfort be That sun that warms you here shall shine on me And those his golden beams to you here lent Shall point on me and gild my banishmentNorfolk for thee remains a heavier doom Which I with some unwillingness pronounce The sly slow hours shall not determinate The dateless limit of thy dear exile The hopeless word of 'never to return' Breathe I against thee upon pain of lifeA heavy sentence my most sovereign liege And all unlook'd for from your Highness' mouth A dearer merit not so deep a maim As to be cast forth in the common air Have I deserved at your Highness' hands The language I have learnt these forty years My native English now I must forgo And now my tongue's use is to me no more Than an unstringed viol or a harp Or like a cunning instrument cas'd up Or being open put into his hands That knows no touch to tune the harmony Within my mouth you have engaol'd my tongue Doubly portcullis'd with my teeth and lips And dull unfeeling barren ignorance Is made my gaoler to attend on me I am too old to fawn upon a nurse Too far in years to be a pupil now What is thy sentence then but speechless death Which robs my tongue from breathing native breathIt boots thee not to be compassionate After our sentence plaining comes too lateThen thus I turn me from my countrv's light To dwell in solemn shades of endless nightReturn again and take an oath with thee Lay on our royal sword your banish'd hands Swear by the duty that you owe to God Our part therein we banish with yourselves To keep the oath that we administer You never shall so help you truth and God Embrace each other's love in banishment Nor never look upon each other's face Nor never write regreet nor reconcile This louring tempest of your homebred hate Nor never by advised purpose meet To plot contrive or complot any ill 'Gainst us our state our subjects or our landI swearAnd I to keep all thisNorfolk so far as to mine enemy By this time had the King permitted us One of our souls had wand'red in the air Banish'd this frail sepulchre of our flesh As now our flesh is banish'd from this land Confess thy treasons ere thou fly the realm Since thou hast far to go bear not along The clogging burden of a guilty soulNo Bolingbroke if ever I were traitor My name be blotted from the book of life And I from heaven banish'd as from hence But what thou art God thou and I do know And all too soon I fear the King shall rue Farewell my liege Now no way can I stray Save back to England an the world's my wayUncle even in the glasses of thine eyes I see thy grieved heart Thy sad aspect Hath from the number of his banish'd years Pluck'd four away ToSix frozen winters spent Return with welcome home from banishmentHow long a time lies in one little word Four lagging winters and four wanton springs End in a word such is the breath of KingsI thank my liege that in regard of me He shortens four years of my son's exile But little vantage shall I reap thereby For ere the six years that he hath to spend Can change their moons and bring their times about My oildried lamp and timebewasted light Shall be extinct with age and endless night My inch of taper will be burnt and done And blindfold death not let me see my sonWhy uncle thou hast many years to liveBut not a minute King that thou canst give Shorten my days thou canst with sullen sorrow And pluck nights from me but not lend a morrow Thou can'st help time to furrow me with age But stop no wrinkle in his pilgrimage Thy word is current with him for my death But dead thy kingdom cannot buy my breathThy son is banish'd upon good advice Whereto thy tongue a partyverdict gave Why at our justice seem'st thou then to lourThings sweet to taste prove in digestion sour You urg'd me as a judge but I had rather You would have bid me argue like a father O had it been a stranger not my child To smooth his fault I should have been more mild A partial slander sought I to avoid And in the sentence my own life destroy'd Alas I look'd when some of you should say I was too strict to make mine own away But you gave leave to my unwilling tongue Against my will to do myself this wrongCousin farewell and uncle bid him so Six years we banish him and he shall go Flourishwith trainCousin farewell what presence must not know From where you do remain let paper showMy lord no leave take I for I will ride As far as land will let me by your sideO to what purpose dost thou hoard thy words That thou returnest no greeting to thy friendsI have too few to take my leave of you When the tongue's office should be prodigal To breathe the abundant dolour of the heartThy grief is but thy absence for a timeJoy absent grief is present for that timeWhat is six winters They are quickly goneTo men in joy but grief makes one hour tenCall it a travel that thou tak'st for pleasureMy heart will sigh when I miscall it so Which finds it an enforced pilgrimageThe sullen passage of thy weary steps Esteem as foil wherein thou art to set The precious jewel of thy home returnNay rather every tedious stride I make Will but remember me what a deal of world I wander from the jewels that I love Must I not serve a long apprenticehood To foreign passages and in the end Having my freedom boast of nothing else But that I was a journeyman to griefAll places that the eye of heaven visits Are to a wise man ports and happy havens Teach thy necessity to reason thus There is no virtue like necessity Think not the King did banish thee But thou the King Woe doth the heavier sit Where it perceives it is but faintly home Go say I sent thee forth to purchase honour And not the King exil'd thee or suppose Devouring pestilence hangs in our air And thou art flying to a fresher clime Look what thy soul holds dear imagine it To lie that way thou goest not whence thou com'st Suppose the singing birds musicians The grass whereon thou tread'st the presence strew'd The flowers fair ladies and thy steps no more Than a delightful measure or a dance For gnarling sorrow hath less power to bite The man that mocks at it and sets it lightO who can hold a fire in his hand By thinking on the frosty Caucasus Or cloy the hungry edge of appetite By bare imagination of a feast Or wallow naked in December snow By thinking on fantastic summer's heat O no the apprehension of the good Gives but the greater feeling to the worse Fell sorrow's tooth doth never rankle more Than when he bites but lanceth not the soreCome come my son I'll bring thee on thy way Had I thy youtli and cause I would not stayThen England's ground farewell sweet soil adieu My mother and my nurse that bears me yet Where'er I wander boast of this I can Though banish'd yet a trueborn English man London The courtthewith andat one door and theat anotherWe did observe Cousin Aumerle How far brought you high Hereford on his wayI brought high Hereford if you call him so But to the next high way and there I left himAnd say what store of parting tears were shedFaith none for me except the northeast wind Which then blew bitterly against our faces Awak'd the sleeping rheum and so by chance Did grace our hollow parting with a tearWhat said our cousin when you parted with him'Farewell' And for my heart disdained that my tongue Should so profane the word that taught me craft To counterfeit oppression of such grief That words seem'd buried in my sorrow's grave Marry would the word 'farewell' have length'ned hours And added years to his short banishment He should have had a volume of farewells But since it would not he had none of meHe is our cousin cousin but 'tis doubt When time shall call him home from banishment Whether our kinsman come to see his friends Ourself and Bushy Bagot here and Green Observ'd his courtship to the common people How he did seem to dive into their hearts With humble and familiar courtesy What reverence he did throw away on slaves Wooing poor craftsmen with the craft of smiles And patient underbearing of his fortune As 'twere to banish their affects with him Off goes his bonnet to an oysterwench A brace of draymen bid God speed him well And had the tribute of his supple knee With 'Thanks my countrymen my loving friends' As were our England in reversion his And he our subjects' next degree in hopeWell he is gone and with him go these thoughts Now for the rebels which stand out in Ireland Expedient manage must be made my liege Ere further leisure yicld them further means For their advantage and your Highness' lossWe will ourself in person to this war And for our coffers with too great a court And liberal largess are grown somewhat light We are enforc'd to farm our royal realm The revenue whereof shall furnish us For our affairs in hand If that come short Our substitutes at home shall have blank charters Whereto when they shall know what men are rich They shall subscribe them for large sums of gold And send them after to supply our wants For we will make for Ireland presentlyBushy what newsOld John of Gaunt is grievous sick my lord Suddenly taken and hath sent postehaste To entreat your Majesty to visit himWhere lies heAt Ely HouseNow put it God in the physician's mind To help him to his grave immediately The lining of his coffers shall make coats To deck our soldiers for these Irish wars Come gentlemen let's all go visit him Pray God we may make haste and come too lateAmen
