 SceneLeonato's orchardHero and two Gentlewomen Margaret and Ursula Hero Good Margaret run thee to the parlour There shalt thou find my cousin Beatrice Proposing with the Prince and Claudio Whisper her ear and tell her I and Ursley Walk in the orchard and our whole discourse Is all of her Say that thou overheard'st us And bid her steal into the pleached bower Where honeysuckles ripened by the sun Forbid the sun to like favourites Made proud by princes that advance their pride Against that power that bred it There will she hide her To listen our propose This is thy office Bear thee well in it and leave us alone Marg I'll make her come I warrant you presently Hero Now Ursula when Beatrice doth come As we do trace this alley up and down Our talk must only be of Benedick When I do name him let it be thy part To praise him more than ever man did merit My talk to thee must be how Benedick Is sick in love with Beatrice Of this matter Is little Cupid's crafty arrow made That only wounds by hearsay Beatrice Now begin For look where Beatrice like a lapwing runs Close by the ground to hear our conferenceBeatrice hides in the arbour Urs The pleasant'st angling is to see the fish Cut with her golden oars the silver stream And greedily devour the treacherous bait So angle we for Beatrice who even now Is couched in the woodbine coverture Fear you not my part of the dialogue Hero Then go we near her that her ear lose nothing Of the false sweet bait that we lay for itThey approach the arbour No truly Ursula she is too disdainful I know her spirits are as coy and wild As haggards of the rock Urs But are you sure That Benedick loves Beatrice so entirely Hero So says the Prince and my newtrothed lord Urs And did they bid you tell her of it madam Hero They did entreat me to acquaint her of it But I persuaded them if they lov'd Benedick To wish him wrestle with affection And never to let Beatrice know of it Urs Why did you so Doth not the gentleman Deserve as full as fortunate a bed As ever Beatrice shall couch upon Hero O god of love I know he doth deserve As much as may be yielded to a man But Nature never fram'd a woman's heart Of prouder stuff than that of Beatrice Disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes Misprizing what they look on and her wit Values itself so highly that to her All matter else seems weak She cannot love Nor take no shape nor project of affection She is so selfendeared Urs Sure I think so And therefore certainly it were not good She knew his love lest she'll make sport at it Hero Why you speak truth I never yet saw man How wise how noble young how rarely featur'd But she would spell him backward If fairfac'd She would swear the gentleman should be her sister If black why Nature drawing of an antic Made a foul blot if tall a lance illheaded If low an agate very vilely cut If speaking why a vane blown with all winds If silent why a block moved with none So turns she every man the wrong side out And never gives to truth and virtue that Which simpleness and merit purchaseth Urs Sure sure such carping is not commendable Hero No not to be so odd and from all fashions As Beatrice is cannot be commendable But who dare tell her so If I should speak She would mock me into air O she would laugh me Out of myself press me to death with wit Therefore let Benedick like cover'd fire Consume away in sighs waste inwardly It were a better death than die with mocks Which is as bad as die with tickling Urs Yet tell her of it Hear what she will say Hero No rather I will go to Benedick And counsel him to fight against his passion And truly I'll devise some honest slanders To stain my cousin with One doth not know How much an ill word may empoison liking Urs O do not do your cousin such a wrong She cannot be so much without true judgment Having so swift and excellent a wit As she is priz'd to have as to refuse So rare a gentleman as Signior Benedick Hero He is the only man of Italy Always excepted my dear Claudio Urs I pray you be not angry with me madam Speaking my fancy Signior Benedick For shape for bearing argument and valour Goes foremost in report through Italy Hero Indeed he hath an excellent good name Urs His excellence did earn it ere he had it When are you married madam Hero Why every day tomorrow Come go in I'll show thee some attires and have thy counsel Which is the best to furnish me tomorrowThey walk away Urs She's lim'd I warrant you We have caught her madam Hero If it prove so then loving goes by haps Some Cupid kills with arrows some with traps Hero and Ursula Beatrice advances from the arbour Beat What fire is in mine ears Can this be true Stand I condemn'd for pride and scorn so much Contempt farewell and maiden pride adieu No glory lives behind the back of such And Benedick love on I will requite thee Taming my wild heart to thy loving hand If thou dost love my kindness shall incite thee To bind our loves up in a holy band For others say thou dost deserve and I Believe it better than reportinglySceneA room in Leonato's houseDon Pedro Claudio Benedick and Leonato Pedro I do but stay till your marriage be consummate and then go I toward Arragon Claud I'll bring you thither my lord if you'll vouchsafe me Pedro Nay that would be as great a soil in the new gloss of your marriage as to show a child his new coat and forbid him to wear it I will only be bold with Benedick for his company for from the crown of his head to the sole of his foot he is all mirth He hath twice or thrice cut Cupid's bowstring and the little hangman dare not shoot at him He hath a heart as sound as a bell and his tongue is the clapper for what his heart thinks his tongue speaks Bene Gallants I am not as I have been Leon So sayMethinks you are sadder Claud I hope he be in love Pedro Hang him truant There's no true drop of blood in him to be truly touch'd with love If he be sad he wants money Bene I have the toothache Pedro Draw it Bene Hang it Claud You must hang it first and draw it afterwards Pedro What sigh for the toothache Leon Where is but a humour or a worm Bene Well every one can master a grief but he that has it Claud Yet say I he is in love Pedro There is no appearance of fancy in him unless it be a fancy that he hath to strange disguises as to be a Dutchman today a Frenchman tomorrow or in the shape of two countries at once as a German from the waist downward all slops and a Spaniard from the hip upward no doublet Unless he have a fancy to this foolery as it appears he hath he is no fool for fancy as you would have it appear he is Claud If he be not in love with some woman there is no believing old signs 'A brushes his hat o' mornings What should that bode Pedro Hath any man seen him at the barber's Claud No but the barber's man hath been seen with him and theold ornament of his cheek hath already stuff'd tennis balls Leon Indeed he looks younger than he did by the loss of a beard Pedro Nay 'a rubs himself with civet Can you smell him out by that Claud That's as much as to say the sweet youth's in love Pedro The greatest note of it is his melancholy Claud And when was he wont to wash his face Pedro Yea or to paint himself for the which I hear what they say of him Claud Nay but his jesting spirit which is newcrept into a lutestring and now govern'd by stops Pedro Indeed that tells a heavy tale for him Conclude conclude he is in love Claud Nay but I know who loves him Pedro That would I know too I warrant one that knows him not Claud Yes and his ill conditions and in despite of all dies for him Pedro She shall be buried with her face upwards Bene Yet is this no charm for the toothache Old signior walk aside with me I have studied eight or nine wise words to speak to you which these hobbyhorses must not hearBenedick and Leonato Pedro For my life to break with him about Beatrice Claud 'Tis even so Hero and Margaret have by this played their parts with Beatrice and then the two bears will not bite one another when they meet John the Bastard John My lord and brother God save you Pedro Good den brother John If your leisure serv'd I would speak with you Pedro In private John If it please you Yet Count Claudio may hear for what I would speak of concerns him Pedro What's the matter John to Claudio Means your lordship to be married tomorrow Pedro You know he does John I know not that when he knows what I know Claud If there be any impediment I pray you discover it John You may think I love you not Let that appear hereafter and aim better at me by that I now will manifest For my brother I think he holds you well and in dearness of heart hath holp to effect your ensuing marriagesurely suit ill spent and labour ill bestowed Pedro Why what's the matter John I came hither to tell you and circumstances short'ned for she has been too long atalking of the lady is disloyal Claud Who Hero John Even sheLeonato's Hero your Hero every man's Hero Claud Disloyal John The word is too good to paint out her wickedness I could say she were worse think you of a worse title and I will fit her to it Wonder not till further warrant Go but with me tonight you shall see her chamber window ent'red even the night before her wedding day If you love her then tomorrow wed her But it would better fit your honour to change your mind Claud May this be so Pedro I will not think it John If you dare not trust that you see confess not that you know If you will follow me I will show you enough and when you have seen more and heard more proceed accordingly Claud If I see anything tonight why I should not marry her tomorrow in the congregation where I should wed there will I shame her Pedro And as I wooed for thee to obtain her I will join with thee to disgrace her John I will disparage her no farther till you are my witnesses Bear it coldly but till midnight and let the issue show itself Pedro O day untowardly turned Claud O mischief strangely thwarting John O plague right well prevented So will you say when you have seen the SequelSceneA streetDogberry and his compartner Verges with the Watch Dog Are you good men and true Verg Yea or else it were pity but they should suffer salvation body and soul Dog Nay that were a punishment too good for them if they should have any allegiance in them being chosen for the Prince's watch Verg Well give them their charge neighbour Dogberry Dog First who think you the most desartless man to be constableWatch Hugh Oatcake sir or George Seacoal for they can write and read Dog Come hither neighbour Seacoal God hath bless'd you with a good name To be a wellfavoured man is the gift of fortune but to write and read comes by natureWatch Both which Master Constable Dog You have I knew it would be your answer Well for your favour sir why give God thanks and make no boast of it and for your writing and reading let that appear when there is no need of such vanity You are thought here to be the most senseless and fit man for the constable of the watch Therefore bear you the lanthorn This is your charge you shall comprehend all vagrom men you are to bid any man stand in the Prince's nameWatch How if 'a will not stand Dog Why then take no note of him but let him go and presently call the rest of the watch together and thank God you are rid of a knave Verg If he will not stand when he is bidden he is none of the Prince's subjects Dog True and they are to meddle with none but the Prince's subjects You shall also make no noise in the streets for for the watch to babble and to talk is most tolerable and not to be enduredWatch We will rather sleep than talk We know what belongs to a watch Dog Why you speak like an ancient and most quiet watchman for I cannot see how sleeping should offend Only have a care that your bills be not stol'n Well you are to call at all the alehouses and bid those that are drunk get them to bedWatch How if they will not Dog Why then let them alone till they are sober If they make you not then the better answer You may say they are not the men you took them forWatch Well sir Dog If you meet a thief you may suspect him by virtue of your office to be no true man and for such kind of men the less you meddle or make with them why the more your honestyWatch If we know him to be a thief shall we not lay hands on him Dog Truly by your office you may but I think they that touch pitch will be defil'd The most peaceable way for you if you do take a thief is to let him show himself what he is and steal out of your company Verg You have been always called a merciful man partner Dog Truly I would not hang a dog by my will much more a man who hath any honesty in him Verg If you hear a child cry in the night you must call to the nurse and bid her still itWatch How if the nurse be asleep and will not hear us Dog Why then depart in peace and let the child wake her with crying for the ewe that will not hear her lamb when it baes will never answer a calf when he bleats Verg 'Tis very true Dog This is the end of the charge you constable are to present the Prince's own person If you meet the Prince in the night you may stay him Verg Nay by'r lady that I think 'a cannot Dog Five shillings to one on't with any man that knows the statutes he may stay him Marry not without the Prince be willing for indeed the watch ought to offend no man and it is an offence to stay a man against his will Verg By'r lady I think it be so Dog Ha ah ha Well masters good night An there be any matter of weight chances call up me Keep your fellows' counsels and your own and good night Come neighbourWatch Well masters we hear our charge Let us go sit here upon the church bench till two and then all to bed Dog One word more honest neighbours I pray you watch about Signior Leonato's door for the wedding being there tomorrow there is a great coil tonight Adieu Be vigitant I beseech youDogberry and Verges Borachio and Conrade Bora What ConradeWatch aside Peace stir not Bora Conrade I say Con Here man I am at thy elbow Bora Mass and my elbow itch'd I thought there would a scab follow Con I will owe thee an answer for that and now forward with thy tale Bora Stand thee close then under this penthouse for it drizzles rain and I will like a true drunkard utter all to theeWatch aside Some treason masters Yet stand close Bora Therefore know I have earned of Don John a thousand ducats Con Is it possible that any villany should be so dear Bora Thou shouldst rather ask if it were possible any villany should be so rich for when rich villains have need of poor ones poor ones may make what price they will Con I wonder at it Bora That shows thou art unconfirm'd Thou knowest that the fashion of a doublet or a hat or a cloak is nothing to a man Con Yes it is apparel Bora I mean the fashion Con Yes the fashion is the fashion Bora Tush I may as well say the fool's the fool But seest thou not what a deformed thief this fashion isWatch aside I know that Deformed 'A bas been a vile thief this seven year 'a goes up and down like a gentleman I remember his name Bora Didst thou not hear somebody Con No 'twas the vane on the house Bora Seest thou not I say what a deformed thief this fashion is how giddily 'a turns about all the hotbloods between fourteen and fiveandthirty sometimes fashioning them like Pharaoh's soldiers in the reechy painting sometime like god Bel's priests in the old church window sometime like the shaven Hercules in the smirch'd wormeaten tapestry where his codpiece seems as massy as his club Con All this I see and I see that the fashion wears out more apparel than the man But art not thou thyself giddy with the fashion too that thou hast shifted out of thy tale into telling me of the fashion Bora Not so neither But know that I have tonight wooed Margaret the Lady Hero's gentlewoman by the name of Hero She leans me out at her mistress' chamber window bids me a thousand times good nightI tell this tale vilely I should first tell thee how the Prince Claudio and my master planted and placed and possessed by my master Don John saw afar off in the orchard this amiable encounter Con And thought they Margaret was Hero Bora Two of them did the Prince and Claudio but the devil my master knew she was Margaret and partly by his oaths which first possess'd them partly by the dark night which did deceive them but chiefly by my villany which did confirm any slander that Don John had made away went Claudio enrag'd swore he would meet her as he was appointed next morning at the temple and there before the whole congregation shame her with what he saw o'ernight and send her home again without a husbandWatch We charge you in the Prince's name standWatch Call up the right Master Constable We have here recover'd the most dangerous piece of lechery that ever was known in the commonwealthWatch And one Deformed is one of them I know him 'a wears a lock Con Masters mastersWatch You'll be made bring Deformed forth I warrant you Con MastersWatch Never speak we charge you Let us obey you to go with us Bora We are like to prove a goodly commodity being taken up of these men's bills Con A commodity in question I warrant you Come we'll obey youSceneA Room in Leonato's houseHero and Margaret
