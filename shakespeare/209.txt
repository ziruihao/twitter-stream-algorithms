Milan Thepalaceand Sir Thurio give us leave I pray awhile We have some secrets to confer aboutNow tell me Proteus what's your will with meMy gracious lord that which I would discover The law of friendship bids me to conceal But when I call to mind your gracious favours Done to me undeserving as I am My duty pricks me on to utter that Which else no worldly good should draw from me Know worthy prince Sir Valentine my friend This night intends to steal away your daughter Myself am one made privy to the plot I know you have determin'd to bestow her On Thurio whom your gentle daughter hates And should she thus be stol'n away from you It would be much vexation to your age Thus for my duty's sake I rather chose To cross my friend in his intended drift Than by concealing it heap on your head A pack of sorrows which would press you down Being unprevented to your timeless graveProteus I thank thee for thine honest care Which to requite command me while I live This love of theirs myself have often seen Haply when they have judg'd me fast asleep And oftentimes have purpos'd to forbid Sir Valentine her company and my court But fearing lest my jealous aim might err And so unworthily disgrace the man A rashness that I ever yet have shunn'd I gave him gentle looks thereby to find That which thyself hast now disclos'd to me And that thou mayst perceive my fear of this Knowing that tender youth is soon suggested I nightly lodge her in an upper tow'r The key whereof myself have ever kept And thence she cannot be convey'd awayKnow noble lord they have devis'd a mean How he her chamber window will ascend And with a corded ladder fetch her down For which the youthful lover now is gone And this way comes he with it presently Where if it please you you may intercept him But good my lord do it so cunningly That my discovery be not aimed at For love of you not hate unto my friend Hath made me publisher of this pretenceUpon mine honour he shall never know That I had any light from thee of thisAdieu my lord Sir Valentine is coming Sir Valentine whither away so fastPlease it your Grace there is a messenger That stays to bear my letters to my friends And I am going to deliver themBe they of much importThe tenour of them doth but signify My health and happy being at your courtNay then no matter stay with me awhile I am to break with thee of some affairs That touch me near wherein thou must be secret 'Tis not unknown to thee that I have sought To match my friend Sir Thurio to my daughterI know it well my lord and sure the match Were rich and honourable besides the gentleman Is full of virtue bounty worth and qualities Beseeming such a wife as your fair daughter Cannot your grace win her to fancy himNo trust me she is peevish sullen froward Proud disobedient stubborn lacking duty Neither regarding that she is my child Nor fearing me as if I were her father And may I say to thee this pride of hers Upon advice hath drawn my love from her And where I thought the remnant of mine age Should have been cherish'd by her childlike duty I now am full resolv'd to take a wife And turn her out to who will take her in Then let her beauty be her weddingdow'r For me and my possessions she esteems notWhat would your Grace have me to do in thisThere is a lady in Verona here Whom I affect but she is nice and coy And nought esteems my aged eloquence Now therefore would I have thee to my tutor For long agone I have forgot to court Besides the fashion of the time is chang'd How and which way I may bestow myself To be regarded in her sunbright eyeWin her with gifts if she respect not words Dumb jewels often in their silent kind More than quick words do move a woman's mindBut she did scorn a present that I sent herA woman sometime scorns what best contents her Send her another never give her o'er For scorn at first makes afterlove the more If she do frown 'tis not in hate of you But rather to beget more love in you If she do chide 'tis not to have you gone For why the fools are mad if left alone Take no repulse whatever she doth say For 'Get you gone' she doth not mean 'Away' Flatter and praise commend extol their graces Though ne'er so black say they have angels' faces That man that hath a tongue I say is no man If with his tongue he cannot win a womanBut she I mean is promis'd by her friends Unto a youthful gentleman of worth And kept severely from resort of men That no man hath access by day to herWhy then I would resort to her by nightAy but the doors be lock'd and keys kept safe That no man hath recourse to her by nightWhat lets but one mayat her windowHer chamber is aloft far from the ground And built so shelving that one cannot climb it Without apparent hazard of his lifeWhy then a ladder quaintly made of cords To cast up with a pair of anchoring hooks Would serve to scale another Hero's tow'r So bold Leander would adventure itNow as thou art a gentleman of blood Advise me where I may have such a ladderWhen would you use it Pray sir tell me thatThis very night for Love is like a child That longs for everything that he can come byBy seven o'clock I'll get you such a ladderBut hark thee I will go to her alone How shall I best convey the ladder thitherIt will be light my lord that you may bear it Under a cloak that is of any lengthA cloak as long as thine will serve the turnAy my good lordThen let me see thy cloak I'll get me one of such another lengthWhy any cloak will serve the turn my lordHow shall I fashion me to wear a cloak I pray thee let me feel thy cloak upon me What letter is this same What's here 'To Silvia' And here an engine fit for my proceeding I'll be so bold to break the seal for onceReads 'My thoughts do harbour with my Silvia nightly And slaves they are to me that send them flying O could their master come and go as lightly Himself would lodge where senseless they are lying My herald thoughts in thy pure bosom rest them While I their king that thither them importune Do curse the grace that with such grace hath blest them Because myself do want my servants' fortune I curse myself for they are sent by me That they should harbour where their lord should be' What's here ilvia this night I will enfranchise thee' 'Tis so and here's the ladder for the purpose Why Phaethon for thou art Merops' son Wilt thou aspire to guide the heavenly car And with thy daring folly burn the world Wilt thou reach stars because they shine on thee Go base intruder overweening slave Bestow thy fawning smiles on equal mates And think my patience more than thy desert Is privilege for thy departure hence Thank me for this more than for all the favours Which all too much I have bestow'd on thee But if thou linger in my territories Longer than swiftest expedition Will give thee time to leave our royal court By heaven my wrath shall far exceed the love I ever bore my daughter or thyself Be gone I will not hear thy vain excuse But as thou lov'st thy life make speed from henceAnd why not death rather than living torment To die is to be banish'd from myself And Silvia is myself banish'd from her Is self from self a deadly banishment What light is light if Silvia be not seen What joy is joy if Silvia be not by Unless it be to think that she is by And feed upon the shadow of perfection Except I be by Silvia in the night There is no music in the nightingale Unless I look on Silvia in the day There is no day for me to look upon She is my essence and I leave to be If I be not by her fair influence Foster'd illumin'd cherish'd kept alive I fly not death to fly his deadly doom Tarry I here I but attend on death But fly I hence I fly away from lifeand Run boy run run seek him outSoho sohoWhat seest thouHim we go to find there's not a hair on 's head but 'tis a ValentineValentineNoWho then his spiritNeitherWhat thenNothingCan nothing speak Master shall I strikeWho wouldst thou strikeNothingVillain forbearWhy sir I'll strike nothing I pray youSirrah I say

Silvia deadNo ValentineNo Valentine indeed for sacred Silvia Hath she forsworn meNo ValentineNo Valentine if Silvia have forsworn me What is your newsSir there is a proclamation that you are vanishedThat thou art banished O that's the news From hence from Silvia and from me thy friendO I have fed upon this woe already And now excess of it will make me surfeit Doth Silvia know that I am banishedAy ay and she hath offered to the doom Which unrevers'd stands in effectual force A sea of melting pearl which some call tears Those at her father's churlish feet she tender'd With them upon her knees her humble self Wringing her hands whose whiteness so became them As if but now they waxed pale for woe But neither bended knees pure hands held up Sad sighs deep groans nor silvershedding tears Could penetrate her uncompassionate sire But Valentine if he be ta'en must die Besides her intercession chaf'd him so When she for thy repeal was suppliant That to close prison he commanded her With many bitter threats of biding thereNo more unless the next word that thou speak'st Have some malignant power upon my life If so I pray thee breathe it in mine ear As ending anthem of my endless dolourCease to lament for that thou canst not help And study help for that which thou lament'st Time is the nurse and breeder of all good Here if thou stay thou canst not see thy love Besides thy staying will abridge thy life Hope is a lover's staff walk hence with that And manage it against despairing thoughts Thy letters may be here though thou art hence Which being writ to me shall be deliver'd Even in the milkwhite bosom of thy love The time now serves not to expostulate Come I'll convey thee through the city gate And ere I part with thee confer at large Of all that may concern

will scarce serve the turnWhy didst not tell me sooner Pox of your love lettersNow will he be swing'd for reading my letter An unmannerly slave that will thrust himself into secrets I'll after to rejoice in the boy's correctionMilan Thepalaceand Sir Thurio fear not but that she will love you Now Valentine is banish'd from her sightSince his exile she hath despis'd me most Forsworn my company and rail'd at me That I am desperate of obtaining herThis weak impress of love is as a figure Trenched in ice which with an hour's heat Dissolves to water and doth lose his form A little time will melt her frozen thoughts And worthless Valentine shall be forgot How now Sir Proteus Is your countryman According to our proclamation goneGone my good lordMy daughter takes his going grievouslyA little time my lord will kill that griefSo I believe but Thurio thinks not so Proteus the good conceit I hold of thee For thou hast shown some sign of good desert Makes me the better to confer with theeLonger than I prove loyal to your Grace Let me not live to look upon your GraceThou know'st how willingly I would effect The match between Sir Thurio and my daughterI do my lordAnd also I think thou art not ignorant How she opposes her against my willShe did my lord when Valentine was hereAy and perversely she persevers so What might we do to make the girl forget The love of Valentine and love Sir ThurioThe best way is to slander Valentine With falsehood cowardice and poor descent Three things that women highly hold in hateAy but she'll think that it is spoke in hateAy if his enemy deliver it Therefore it must with circumstance be spoken By one whom she esteemeth as his friendThen you must undertake to slander himAnd that my lord I shall be loath to do 'Tis an ill office for a gentleman Especially against his very friendWhere your good word cannot advantage him Your slander never can endamage him Therefore the office is indifferent Being entreated to it by your friendYou have prevail'd my lord if I can do it By aught that I can speak in his dispraise She shall not long continue love to him But say this weed her love from Valentine It follows not that she will love Sir ThurioTherefore as you unwind her love from him Lest it should ravel and be good to none You must provide to bottom it on me Which must be done by praising me as much As you in worth dispraise Sir ValentineAnd Proteus we dare trust you in this kind Because we know on Valentine's report You are already Love's firm votary And cannot soon revolt and change your mind Upon this warrant shall you have access Where you with Silvia may confer at large For she is lumpish heavy melancholy And for your friend's sake will be glad of you Where you may temper her by your persuasion To hate young Valentine and love my friendAs much as I can do I will effect But you Sir Thurio are not sharp enough You must lay lime to tangle her desires By wailful sonnets whose composed rhymes Should be fullfraught with serviceable vowsAy Much is the force of heavenbred poesySay that upon the altar of her beauty You sacrifice your tears your sighs your heart Write till your ink be dry and with your tears Moist it again and frame some feeling line That may discover such integrity For Orpheus' lute was strung with poets' sinews Whose golden touch could soften steel and stones Make tigers tame and huge leviathans Forsake unsounded deeps to dance on sands After your direlamenting elegies Visit by night your lady's chamber window With some sweet consort to their instruments Tune a deploring dump the night's dead silence Will well become such sweetcomplaining grievance This or else nothing will inherit herThis discipline shows thou hast been in loveAnd thy advice this night I'll put in practice Therefore sweet Proteus my directiongiver Let us into the city presently To sort some gentlemen well skill'd in music I have a sonnet that will serve the turn To give the onset to thy good adviceAbout it gentlemenWe'll wait upon your Grace till after supper And afterward determine our proceedingsEven now about it I will pardon you
