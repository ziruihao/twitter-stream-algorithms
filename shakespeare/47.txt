 SceneThe rebel camp near ShrewsburyHarry Hotspur Worcester and Douglas Hot Well said my noble Scot If speaking truth In this fine age were not thought flattery Such attribution should the Douglas have As not a soldier of this season's stamp Should go so general current through the world By God I cannot flatter I defy The tongues of soothers but a braver place In my heart's love hath no man than yourself Nay task me to my word approve me lord Doug Thou art the king of honour No man so potent breathes upon the ground But I will beard him one with letters Hot Do so and 'tis well What letters hast thou there I can but thank you Messenger These letters come from your father Hot Letters from him Why comes he not himself Mess He cannot come my lord he is grievous sick Hot Zounds how has he the leisure to be sick In such a justling time Who leads his power Under whose government come they along Mess His letters bears his mind not I my lord Wor I prithee tell me doth he keep his bed Mess He did my lord four days ere I set forth And at the time of my departure thence He was much fear'd by his physicians Wor I would the state of time had first been whole Ere he by sickness had been visited His health was never better worth than now Hot Sick now droop now This sickness doth infect The very lifeblood of our prise 'Tis catching hither even to our camp He writes me here that inward sickness And that his friends by deputation could not So soon be drawn no did he think it meet To lay so dangerous and dear a trust On any soul remov'd but on his own Yet doth he give us bold advertisement That with our small conjunction we should on To see how fortune is dispos'd to us For as he writes there is no quailing now Because the King is certainly possess'd Of all our purposes What say you to it Wor Your father's sickness is a maim to us Hot A perilous gash a very limb lopp'd off And yet in faith it is not His present want Seems more than we shall find it Were it good To set the exact wealth of all our states All at one cast to set so rich a man On the nice hazard of one doubtful hour It were not good for therein should we read The very bottom and the soul of hope The very list the very utmost bound Of all our fortunes Doug Faith and so we should Where now remains a sweet reversion We may boldly spend upon the hope of what Is to come in A comfort of retirement lives in this Hot A rendezvous a home to fly unto If that the devil and mischance look big Upon the maidenhead of our affairs Wor But yet I would your father had been here The quality and hair of our attempt Brooks no division It will be thought By some that know not why he is away That wisdom loyalty and mere dislike Of our proceedings kept the Earl from hence And think how such an apprehension May turn the tide of fearful faction And breed a kind of question in our cause For well you know we of the off'ring side Must keep aloof from strict arbitrement And stop all sightholes every loop from whence The eye of reason may pry in upon us This absence of your father's draws a curtain That shows the ignorant a kind of fear Before not dreamt of Hot You strain too far I rather of his absence make this use It lends a lustre and more great opinion A larger dare to our great prise Than if the Earl were here for men must think If we without his help can make a head To push against a kingdom with his help We shall o'erturn it topsyturvy down Yet all goes well yet all our joints are whole Doug As heart can think There is not such a word Spoke of in Scotland as this term of fear Sir Richard Vernon Hot My cousin Vernon welcome by my soul Ver Pray God my news be worth a welcome lord The Earl of Westmoreland seven thousand strong Is marching hitherwards with him Prince John Hot No harm What more Ver And further I have learn'd The King himself in person is set forth Or hitherwards intended speedily With strong and mighty preparation Hot He shall be welcome too Where is his son The nimblefooted madcap Prince of Wales And his comrades that daff'd the world aside And bid it pass Ver All furnish'd all in arms All plum'd like estridges that with the wind Bated like eagles having lately bath'd Glittering in golden coats like images As full of spirit as the month of May And gorgeous as the sun at midsummer Wanton as youthful goats wild as young bulls I saw young Harry with his beaver on His cushes on his thighs gallantly arm'd Rise from the ground like feathered Mercury And vaulted with such ease into his seat As if an angel dropp'd down from the clouds To turn and wind a fiery Pegasus And witch the world with noble horsemanship Hot No more no more Worse than the sun in March This praise doth nourish agues Let them come They come like sacrifices in their trim And to the fireey'd maid of smoky war All hot and bleeding Will we offer them The mailed Mars Shall on his altar sit Up to the ears in blood I am on fire To hear this rich reprisal is so nigh And yet not ours Come let me taste my horse Who is to bear me like a thunderbolt Against the bosom of the Prince of Wales Harry to Harry shall hot horse to horse Meet and ne'er part till one drop down a corse that Glendower were come Ver There is more news I learn'd in Worcester as I rode along He cannot draw his power this fourteen days Doug That's the worst tidings that I hear of yet Wor Ay by my faith that bears a frosty sound Hot What may the King's whole battle reach unto Ver To thirty thousand Hot Forty let it be My father and Glendower being both away The powers of us may serve so great a day Come let us take a muster speedily Doomsday is near Die all die merrily Doug Talk not of dying I am out of fear Of death or death's hand for this one halfyearSceneA public road near CoventryFalstaff

as fear the report of a caliver worse than a struck fowl or a hurt wild duck I press'd me none but such toastsandbutter with hearts in their bellies no bigger than pins' heads and they have bought out their services and now my whole charge consists of ancients corporals lieutenants gentlemen of companies slaves as ragged as Lazarus in the painted cloth where the glutton's dogs licked his sores and such as indeed were never soldiers but discarded unjust servingmen younger sons to Younger brothers revolted tapsters and ostlers tradefall'n the cankers of a calm world and a long peace ten times more dishonourable ragged than an old fac'd ancient and such have I to fill up the rooms of them that have bought out their services that you would think that I had a hundred and fifty tattered Prodigals lately come from swinekeeping from eating draff and husks A mad fellow met me on the way and told me I had unloaded all the gibbets and press'd the dead bodies No eye hath seen such scarecrows I'll not march through Coventry with them that's flat Nay and the villains march wide betwixt the legs as if they had gyves on for indeed I had the most of them out of prison There's but a shirt and a half in all my company and the halfshirt is two napkins tack'd together and thrown over the shoulders like a herald's coat without sleeves and the shirt to say the truth stol'n from my host at Saint Alban's or the rednose innkeeper of Daventry But that's all one they'll find linen enough on every hedgethe Prince and the Lord of Westmoreland Prince How now blown Jack How now quilt

bare But sirrah make haste Percy 's already in the fieldFal What is the King encamp'd West He is Sir John I fear we shall stay too long Fal Well To the latter end of a fray and the beginning of a feast Fits a dull fighter and a keen guestSceneThe rebel camp near ShrewsburyHotspur Worcester Douglas Vernon Hot We'll fight with him tonight Wor It may not be Doug You give him then advantage Ver Not a whit Hot Why say you so Looks he no for supply Ver So do we Hot His is certain ours 's doubtful Wor Good cousin be advis'd stir not tonight Ver Do not my lord Doug You do not counsel well You speak it out of fear and cold heart Ver Do me no slander Douglas By my life And I dare well maintain it with my life If wellrespected honour bid me on I hold as little counsel with weak fear As you my lord or any Scot that this day lives Let it be seen tomorrow in the battle Which of us fears Doug Yea or tonight Ver Content Hot Tonight sayCome come it may not be I wonder much Being men of such great leading as you are That you foresee not what impediments Drag back our expedition Certain horse Of my cousin Vernon's are not yet come up Your uncle Worcester's horse came but today And now their pride and mettle is asleep Their courage with hard labour tame and dull That not a horse is half the half of himself Hot So are the horses of the enemy In general journeybated and brought low The better part of ours are full of rest Wor The number of the King exceedeth ours For God's sake cousin stay till all come in The trumpet sounds a parley Sir Walter Blunt Blunt I come with gracious offers from the King If you vouchsafe me hearing and respect Hot Welcome Sir Walter Blunt and would to God You were of our determination Some of us love you well and even those some Envy your great deservings and good name Because you are not of our quality But stand against us like an enemy Blunt And God defend but still I should stand so So long as out of limit and true rule You stand against anointed majesty But to my charge The King hath sent to know The nature of your griefs and whereupon You conjure from the breast of civil peace Such bold hostility teaching his duteous land Audacious cruelty If that the King Have any way your good deserts forgot Which he confesseth to be manifold He bids you name your griefs and with all speed You shall have your desires with interest And pardon absolute for yourself and these Herein misled by your suggestion Hot The King is kind and well we know the King Knows at what time to promise when to pay My father and my uncle and myself Did give him that same royalty he wears And when he was not sixandtwenty strong Sick in the world's regard wretched and low A poor unminded outlaw sneaking home My father gave him welcome to the shore And when he heard him swear and vow to God He came but to be Duke of Lancaster To sue his livery and beg his peace With tears of innocency and terms of zeal My father in kind heart and pity mov'd Swore him assistance and performed it too Now when the lords and barons of the realm Perceiv'd Northumberland did lean to him The more and less came in with cap and knee Met him on boroughs cities villages Attended him on bridges stood in lanes Laid gifts before him proffer'd him their oaths Give him their heirs as pages followed him Even at the heels in golden multitudes He presently as greatness knows itself Steps me a little higher than his vow Made to my father while his blood was poor Upon the naked shore at Ravenspurgh And now forsooth takes on him to reform Some certain edicts and some strait decrees That lie too heavy on the commonwealth Cries out upon abuses seems to weep Over his country's wrongs and by this face This seeming brow of justice did he win The hearts of all that he did angle for Proceeded further cut me off the heads Of all the favourites that the absent King In deputation left behind him here When he was personal in the Irish war But Tut I came not to hear this Hot Then to the point In short time after lie depos'd the King Soon after that depriv'd him of his life And in the neck of that task'd the whole state To make that worse suff'red his kinsman March Who is if every owner were well placid Indeed his king to be engag'd in Wales There without ransom to lie forfeited Disgrac'd me in my happy victories Sought to entrap me by intelligence Rated mine uncle from the Council board In rage dismiss'd my father from the court Broke an oath on oath committed wrong on wrong And in conclusion drove us to seek out This head of safety and withal to pry Into his title the which we find Too indirect for long continuance Blunt Shall I return this answer to the King Hot Not so Sir Walter We'll withdraw awhile Go to the King and let there be impawn'd Some surety for a safe return again And In the morning early shall mine uncle Bring him our purposes and so farewell Blunt I would you would accept of grace and love Hot And may be so we shall Blunt Pray God you doSceneYork The Archbishop's Palacethe Archbishop of York and Sir Michael Arch Hie good Sir Michael bear this sealed brief With winged haste to the Lord Marshal This to my cousin Scroop and all the

fortune of ten thousand men Must bide the touch for sir at Shrewsbury As I am truly given to understand The King with mighty and quickraised power Meets with Lord Harry and I fear Sir Michael What
