A plain near Mortimer's Cross in Herefordshire A marchand their powerI wonder how our princely father scap'd Or whether he be scap'd away or no From Clifford's and Northumberland's pursuit Had he been ta'en we should have heard the news Had he been slain we should have heard the news Or had he scap'd methinks we should have heard The happy tidings of his good escape How fares my brother Why is he so sadI cannot joy until I be resolv'd Where our right valiant father is become I saw him in the battle range about And watch'd him how he singled Clifford forth Methought he bore him in the thickest troop As doth a lion in a herd of neat Or as a bear encompass'd round with dogs Who having pinch'd a few and made them cry The rest stand all aloof and bark at him So far'd our father with his enemies So fled his enemies my warlike father Methinks 'tis prize enough to be his son See how the morning opes her golden gates And takes her farewell of the glorious sun How well resembles it the prime of youth Trimm'd like a younker prancing to his loveDazzle mine eyes or do I see three sunsThree glorious suns each one a perfect sun Not separated with the racking clouds But sever'd in a pale clearshining sky See see they join embrace and seem to kiss As if they vow'd some league inviolable Now are they but one lamp one light one sun In this the heaven figures some event'Tis wondrous strange the like yet never heard of I think it cites us brother to the field That we the sons of brave Plantagenet Each one already blazing by our meeds Should notwithstanding join our lights together And overshine the earth as this the world Whate'er it bodes henceforward will I bear Upon my target three fair shining sunsNay bear three daughters by your leave I speak it You love the breeder better than the male ablowing But what art thou whose heavy looks foretell Some dreadful story hanging on thy tongueAh one that was a woeful lookeron When as the noble Duke of York was slain Your princely father and my loving lordO speak no more for I have heard too muchSay how he died for I will hear it allEnvironed he was with many foes And stood against them as the hope of Troy Against the Greeks that would have ent'red Troy But Hercules himself must yield to odds And many strokes though with a little axe Hews down and fells the hardesttimber'd oak By many hands your father was subdu'd But only slaught'red by the ireful arm Of unrelenting Clifford and the Queen Who crown'd the gracious Duke in high despite Laugh'd in his face and when with grief he wept The ruthless Queen gave him to dry his cheeks A napkin steeped in the harmless blood Of sweet young Rutland by rough Clifford slain And after many scorns many foul taunts They took his head and on the gates of York They set the same and there it doth remain The saddest spectacle that e'er I view'dSweet Duke of York our prop to lean upon Now thou art gone we have no staff no stay O Clifford boist'rous Clifford thou hast slain The flow'r of Europe for his chivalry And treacherously hast thou vanquish'd him For hand to hand he would have vanquish'd thee Now my soul's palace is become a prison Ah would she break from hence that this my body Might in the ground be closed up in rest For never henceforth shall I joy again Never O never shall I see more joyI cannot weep for all my body's moisture Scarce serves to quench my furnaceburning heart Nor can my tongue unload my heart's great burden For selfsame wind that I should speak withal Is kindling coals that fires all my breast And burns me up with flames that tears would quench To weep is to make less the depth of grief Tears then for babes blows and revenge for me Richard I bear thy name I'll venge thy death Or die renowned by attempting itHis name that valiant duke hath left with thee His dukedom and his chair with me is leftNay if thou be that princely eagle's bird Show thy descent by gazing 'gainst the sun For chair and dukedom throne and kingdom say Either that is thine or else thou wert not hisMarchand their armyHow now fair lords What fare What news abroadGreat Lord of Warwick if we should recount Our baleful news and at each word's deliverance Stab poinards in our flesh till all were told The words would add more anguish than the wounds O valiant lord the Duke of York is slainO Warwick Warwick that Plantagenet Which held thee dearly as his soul's redemption Is by the stern Lord Clifford done to deathTen days ago I drown'd these news in tears And now to add more measure to your woes I come to tell you things sith then befall'n After the bloody fray at Wakefield fought Where your brave father breath'd his latest gasp Tidings as swiftly as the posts could run Were brought me of your loss and his depart I then in London keeper of the King Muster'd my soldiers gathered flocks of friends And very well appointed as I thought March'd toward Saint Albans to intercept the Queen Bearing the King in my behalf along For by my scouts I was advertised That she was coming with a full intent To dash our late decree in parliament Touching King Henry's oath and your succession Short tale to make we at Saint Albans met Our battles join'd and both sides fiercely fought But whether 'twas the coldness of the King Who look'd full gently on his warlike queen That robb'd my soldiers of their heated spleen Or whether 'twas report of her success Or more than common fear of Clifford's rigour Who thunders to his captives blood and death I cannot judge but to conclude with truth Their weapons like to lightning came and went Our soldiers' like the nightowl's lazy flight Or like an idle thresher with a flail Fell gently down as if they struck their friends I cheer'd them up with justice of our cause With promise of high pay and great rewards But all in vain they had no heart to fight And we in them no hope to win the day So that we fled the King unto the Queen Lord George your brother Norfolk and myself In haste posthaste are come to join with you For in the marches here we heard you were Making another head to fight againWhere is the Duke of Norfolk gentle Warwick And when came George from Burgundy to EnglandSome six miles off the Duke is with the soldiers And for your brother he was lately sent From your kind aunt Duchess of Burgundy With aid of soldiers to this needful war'Twas odds belike when valiant Warwick fled Oft have I heard his praises in pursuit But ne'er till now his scandal of retireNor now my scandal Richard dost thou hear For thou shalt know this strong right hand of mine Can pluck the diadem from faint Henry's head And wring the awful sceptre from his fist Were he as famous and as bold in war As he is fam'd for mildness peace and prayerI know it well Lord Warwick blame me not 'Tis love I bear thy glories makes me speak But in this troublous time what's to be done Shall we go throw away our coats of steel And wrap our bodies in black mourninggowns Numbering our AveMaries with our beads Or shall we on the helmets of our foes Tell our devotion with revengeful arms If for the last say 'Ay' and to it lordsWhy therefore Warwick came to seek you out And therefore comes my brother Montague Attend me lords The proud insulting Queen With Clifford and the haught Northumberland And of their feather many moe proud birds Have wrought the easymelting King like wax He swore consent to your succession His oath enrolled in the parliament And now to London all the crew are gone To frustrate both his oath and what beside May make against the house of Lancaster Their power I think is thirty thousand strong Now if the help of Norfolk and myself With all the friends that thou brave Earl of March Amongst the loving Welshmen canst procure Will but amount to five and twenty thousand Why Via to London will we march amain And once again bestride our foaming steeds And once again cry 'Charge upon our foes' But never once again turn back and flyAy now methinks I hear great Warwick speak Ne'er may he live to see a sunshine day That cries 'Retire' if Warwick bid him stayLord Warwick on thy shoulder will I lean And when thou fail'st as God forbid the hour Must Edward fall which peril heaven forfendNo longer Earl of March but Duke of York The next degree is England's royal throne For King of England shalt thou be proclaim'd In every borough as we pass along And he that throws not up his cap for joy Shall for the fault make forfeit of his head King Edward valiant Richard Montague Stay we no longer dreaming of renown But sound the trumpets and about our taskThen Clifford were thy heart as hard as steel As thou hast shown it flinty by thy deeds I come to pierce it or to give thee mineThen strike up drums God and Saint George for us a How now what newsThe Duke of Norfolk sends you word by me The Queen is coming with a puissant host And craves your company for speedy counselWhy then it sorts brave warriors let's away Before York Flourishthe with drum and trumpetsWelcome my lord to this brave town of York Yonder's the head of that archenemy That sought to be encompass'd with your crown Doth not the object cheer your heart my lordAy as the rocks cheer them that fear their wreck To see this sight it irks my very soul Withhold revenge dear God 'tis not my fault Nor wittingly have I infring'd my vowMy gracious liege this too much lenity And harmful pity must be laid aside To whom do lions cast their gentle looks Not to the beast that would usurp their den Whose hand is that the forest bear doth lick Not his that spoils her young before her face Who scapes the lurking serpent's mortal sting Not he that sets his foot upon her back The smallest worm will turn being trodden on And doves will peck in safeguard of their brood Ambitious York did level at thy crown Thou smiling while he knit his angry brows He but a Duke would have his son a king And raise his issue like a loving sire Thou being a king bless'd with a goodly son Didst yield consent to disinherit him Which argued thee a most unloving father Unreasonable creatures feed their young And though man's face be fearful to their eyes Yet in protection of their tender ones Who hath not seen them even with those wings Which sometime they have us'd with fearful flight Make war with him that climb'd unto their nest Offering their own lives in their young's defence For shame my liege make them your precedent Were it not pity that this goodly boy Should lose his birthright by his father's fault And long hereafter say unto his child 'What my greatgrandfather and grandsire got My careless father fondly gave away' Ah what a shame were this Look on the boy And let his manly face which promiseth Successful fortune steel thy melting heart To hold thine own and leave thine own with himFull well hath Clifford play'd the orator Inferring arguments of mighty force But Clifford tell me didst thou never hear That things ill got had ever bad success And happy always was it for that son Whose father for his hoarding went to hell I'll leave my son my virtuous deeds behind And would my father had left me no more For all the rest is held at such a rate As brings a thousandfold more care to keep Than in possession any jot of pleasure Ah cousin York would thy best friends did know How it doth grieve me that thy head is hereMy lord cheer up your spirits our foes are nigh And this soft courage makes your followers faint You promis'd knighthood to our forward son Unsheathe your sword and dub him presently Edward kneel downEdward Plantagenet arise a knight And learn this lesson Draw thy sword in right My gracious father by your kingly leave I'll draw it as apparent to the crown And in that quarrel use it to the deathWhy that is spoken like a toward princea Royal commanders be in readiness For with a band of thirty thousand men Comes Warwick backing of the Duke of York And in the towns as they do march along Proclaims him king and many fly to him Darraign your battle for they are at handI would your Highness would depart the field The Queen hath best success when you are absentAy good my lord and leave us to our fortuneWhy that's my fortune too therefore I'll stayBe it with resolution then to fight My royal father cheer these noble lords And hearten those that fight in your defence Unsheathe your sword good father cry aint George'Marchand soldiersNow perjur'd Henry wilt thou kneel for grace And set thy diadem upon my head Or bide the mortal fortune of the fieldGo rate thy minions proud insulting boy Becomes it thee to be thus bold in terms Before thy sovereign and thy lawful kingI am his king and he should bow his knee I was adopted heir by his consent Since when his oath is broke for as I hear You that are King though he do wear the crown Have caus'd him by new act of parliament To blot out me and put his own son inAnd reason too Who should succeed the father but the sonAre you there butcher O I cannot speakAy crookback here I stand to answer thee Or any he the proudest of thy sort'Twas you that kill'd young Rutland was it notAy and old York and yet not satisfiedFor God's sake lords give signal to the fightWhat say'st thou Henry Wilt thou yield the crownWhy how now longtongu'd Warwick Dare you speak When you and I met at Saint Albans last Your legs did better service than your handsThen 'twas my turn to fly and now 'tis thineYou said so much before and yet you fled'Twas not your valour Clifford drove me thenceNo nor your manhood that durst make you stayNorthumberland I hold thee reverently Break off the parley for scarce I can refrain The execution of my bigswol'n heart Upon that Clifford that cruel childkillerI slew thy father call'st thou him a childAy like a dastard and a treacherous coward As thou didst kill our tender brother Rutland But ere sunset I'll make thee curse the deedHave done with words my lords and hear me speakDefy them then or else hold close thy lipsI prithee give no limits to my tongue I am a king and privileg'd to speakMy liege the wound that bred this meeting here Cannot be cur'd by words therefore be stillThen executioner unsheathe thy sword By Him that made us all I am resolv'd That Clifford's manhood lies upon his tongueSay Henry shall I have my right or no A thousand men have broke their fasts today That ne'er shall dine unless thou yield the crownIf thou deny their blood upon thy head For York in justice puts his armour on If that be right which Warwick says is right There is no wrong but every thing is rightWhoever got thee there thy mother stands For well I wot thou hast thy mother's tongueBut thou art neither like thy sire nor dam But like a foul misshapen stigmatic Mark'd by the destinies to be avoided As venom toads or lizards' dreadful stingsIron of Naples hid with English gilt Whose father bears the title of a king As if a channel should be call'd the sea Sham'st thou not knowing whence thou art extraught To let thy tongue detect thy baseborn heartA wisp of straw were worth a thousand crowns To make this shameless callet know herself Helen of Greece was fairer far than thou Although thy husband may be Menelaus And ne'er was Agamemmon's brother wrong'd By that false woman as this king by thee His father revell'd in the heart of France And tam'd the King and made the Dauphin stoop And had he match'd according to his state He might have kept that glory to this day But when he took a beggar to his bed And grac'd thy poor sire with his bridal day Even then that sunshine brew'd a show'r for him That wash'd his father's fortunes forth of France And heap'd sedition on his crown at home For what hath broach'd this tumult but thy pride Hadst thou been meek our title still had slept And we in pity of the gentle King Had slipp'd our claim until another ageBut when we saw our sunshine made thy spring And that thy summer bred us no increase We set the axe to thy usurping root And though the edge hath something hit ourselves Yet know thou since we have begun to strike We'll never leave till we have hewn thee down Or bath'd thy growing with our heated bloodsAnd in this resolution I defy thee Not willing any longer conference Since thou deniest the gentle King to speak Sound trumpets let our bloody colours wave And either victory or else a graveStay EdwardNo wrangling woman we'll no longer stay These words will cost ten thousand lives this day A field of battle between Towton and Saxton in Yorkshire Alarum excursionsForspent with toil as runners with a race I lay me down a little while to breathe For strokes receiv'd and many blows repaid Have robb'd my strongknit sinews of their strength And spite of spite needs must I rest awhilerunningSmile gentle heaven or strike ungentle death For this world frowns and Edward's sun is cloudedHow now my lord What hap What hope of good Our hap is lost our hope but sad despair Our ranks are broke and ruin follows us What counsel give you Whither shall we flyBootless is flight they follow us with wings And weak we are and cannot shun pursuit Ah Warwick why hast thou withdrawn thyself Thy brother's blood the thirsty earth hath drunk Broach'd with the steely point of Clifford's lance And in the very pangs of death he cried Like to a dismal clangor heard from far 'Warwick revenge Brother revenge my death' So underneath the belly of their steeds That stain'd their fetlocks in his smoking blood The noble gentleman gave up the ghostThen let the earth be drunken with our blood I'll kill my horse because I will not fly Why stand we like softhearted women here Wailing our losses whiles the foe doth rage And look upon as if the tragedy Were play'd in jest by counterfeiting actors Here on my knee I vow to God above I'll never pause again never stand still Till either death hath clos'd these eyes of mine Or fortune given me measure of revengeO Warwick I do bend my knee with thine And in this vow do chain my soul to thine And ere my knee rise from the earth's cold face I throw my hands mine eyes my heart to Thee Thou setterup and pluckerdown of kings Beseeching Thee if with Thy will it stands That to my foes this body must be prey Yet that Thy brazen gates of heaven may ope And give sweet passage to my sinful soul Now lords take leave until we meet again Where'er it be in heaven or in earthBrother give me thy hand and gentle Warwick Let me embrace thee in my weary arms I that did never weep now melt with woe That winter should cut off our springtime soAway away Once more sweet lords farewellYet let us all together to our troops And give them leave to fly that will not stay And call them pillars that will stand to us And if we thrive promise them such rewards As victors wear at the Olympian games This may plant courage in their quailing breasts For yet is hope of life and victory Forslow no longer make we hence amain Another part of the field Excursionsand Now Clifford I have singled thee alone Suppose this arm is for the Duke of York And this for Rutland both bound to revenge Wert thou environ'd with a brazen wallNow Richard I am with thee here alone This is the hand that stabbed thy father York And this the hand that slew thy brother Rutland And here's the heart that triumphs in their death And cheers these hands that slew thy sire and brother To execute the like upon thyself And so have at thee They fightfliesNay Warwick single out some other chase For I myself will hunt this wolf to deathAnother part of the field AlarumaloneThis battle fares like to the morning's war When dying clouds contend with growing light What time the shepherd blowing of his nails Can neither call it perfect day nor night Now sways it this way like a mighty sea Forc'd by the tide to combat with the wind Now sways it that way like the selfsame sea Forc'd to retire by fury of the wind Sometime the flood prevails and then the wind Now one the better then another best Both tugging to be victors breast to breast Yet neither conqueror nor conquered So is the equal poise of this fell war Here on this molehill will I sit me down To whom God will there be the victory For Margaret my queen and Clifford too Have chid me from the battle swearing both They prosper best of all when I am thence Would I were dead if God's good will were so For what is in this world but grief and woe O God methinks it were a happy life To be no better than a homely swain To sit upon a hill as I do now To carve out dials quaintly point by point Thereby to see the minutes how they run How many makes the hour full complete How many hours brings about the day How many days will finish up the year How many years a mortal man may live When this is known then to divide the times So many hours must I tend my flock So many hours must I take my rest So many hours must I contemplate So many hours must I sport myself So many days my ewes have been with young So many weeks ere the poor fools will can So many years ere I shall shear the fleece So minutes hours days months and years Pass'd over to the end they were created Would bring white hairs unto a quiet grave Ah what a life were this how sweet how lovely Gives not the hawthorn bush a sweeter shade To shepherds looking on their silly sheep Than doth a rich embroider'd canopy To kings that fear their subjects' treachery O yes it doth a thousandfold it doth And to conclude the shepherd's homely curds His cold thin drink out of his leather bottle His wonted sleep under a fresh tree's shade All which secure and sweetly he enjoys Is far beyond a prince's delicates His viands sparkling in a golden cup His body couched in a curious bed When care mistrust and treason waits on himAlaruma son that hath kill'd his Father atone door and a that hath kill'd his Son atanother doorIll blows the wind that profits nobody This man whom hand to hand I slew in fight May be possessed with some store of crowns And I that haply take them from him now May yet ere night yield both my life and them To some man else as this dead man doth me Who's this O God It is my father's face Whom in this conflict I unwares have kill'd O heavy times begetting such events From London by the King was I press'd forth My father being the Earl of Warwick's man Came on the part of York press'd by his master And I who at his hands receiv'd my life Have by my hands of life bereaved him Pardon me God I knew not what I did And pardon father for I knew not thee My tears shall wipe away these bloody marks And no more words till they have flow'd their fillO piteous spectacle O bloody times Whiles lions war and battle for their dens Poor harmless lambs abide their enmity Weep wretched man I'll aid thee tear for tear And let our hearts and eyes like civil war Be blind with tears and break o'ercharg'd with griefbearing of his Thou that so stoutly hath resisted me Give me thy gold if thou hast any gold For I have bought it with an hundred blows But let me see Is this our foeman's face Ah no no no no it is mine only son Ah boy if any life be left in thee Throw up thine eye See see what show'rs arise Blown with the windy tempest of my heart Upon thy wounds that kills mine eye and heart O pity God this miserable age What stratagems how fell how butcherly Erroneous mutinous and unnatural This deadly quarrel daily doth beget O boy thy father gave thee life too soon And hath bereft thee of thy life too lateWoe above woe grief more than common grief O that my death would stay these ruthful deeds O pity pity gentle heaven pity The red rose and the white are on his face The fatal colours of our striving houses The one his purple blood right well resembles The other his pale cheeks methinks presenteth Wither one rose and let the other flourish If you contend a thousand lives must perishHow will my mother for a father's death Take on with me and ne'er be satisfiedHow will my wife for slaughter of my son Shed seas of tears and ne'er be satisfiedHow will the country for these woeful chances Misthink the King and not be satisfiedWas ever son so rued a father's deathWas ever father so bemoan'd his sonWas ever king so griev'd for subjects' woe Much is your sorrow mine ten times so muchI'll bear thee hence where I may weep my fillwith the bodyThese arms of mine shall be thy windingsheet My heart sweet boy shall be thy sepulchre For from my heart thine image ne'er shall go My sighing breast shall be thy funeral bell And so obsequious will thy father be Even for the loss of thee having no more As Priam was for all his valiant sons I'll bear thee hence and let them fight that will For I have murdered where I should not killwith the bodySadhearted men much overgone with care Here sits a king more woeful than you areAlarums excursions andFly father fly for all your friends are fled And Warwick rages like a chafed bull Away for death doth hold us in pursuitMount you my lord towards Berwick post amain Edward and Richard like a brace of greyhounds Having the fearful flying hare in sight With fiery eyes sparkling for very wrath And bloody steel grasp'd in their ireful hands Are at our backs and therefore hence amainAway for vengeance comes along with them Nay stay not to expostulate make speed Or else come after I'll away beforeNay take me with thee good sweet Exeter Not that I fear to stay but love to go Whither the Queen intends Forward away Another part of the field A loud alarum woundedHere burns my candle out ay here it dies Which whiles it lasted gave King Henry light O Lancaster I fear thy overthrow More than my body's parting with my soul My love and fear glu'd many friends to thee And now I fall thy tough commixture melts Impairing Henry strength'ning misproud York The common people swarm like summer flies And whither fly the gnats but to the sun And who shines now but Henry's enemies O Phoebus hadst thou never given consent That Phaethon should check thy fiery steeds Thy burning car never had scorch'd the earth And Henry hadst thou sway'd as kings should do Or as thy father and his father did Giving no ground unto the house of York They never then had sprung like summer flies I and ten thousand in this luckless realm Had left no mourning widows for our death And thou this day hadst kept thy chair in peace For what doth cherish weeds but gentle air And what makes robbers bold but too much lenity Bootless are plaints and cureless are my wounds No way to fly nor strength to hold out flight The foe is merciless and will not pity For at their hands I have deserv'd no pity The air hath got into my deadly wounds And much effuse of blood doth make me faint Come York and Richard Warwick and the rest I stabb'd your fathers' bosoms split my breastHe faintsAlarum and retreatand soldiersNow breathe we lords Good fortune bids us pause And smooth the frowns of war with peaceful looks Some troops pursue the bloodyminded Queen That led calm Henry though he were a king As doth a sail fill'd with a fretting gust Command an argosy to stern the waves But think you lords that Clifford fled with themNo 'tis impossible he should escape For though before his face I speak the words Your brother Richard mark'd him for the grave And whereso'er he is he's surely deadgroans and diesWhose soul is that which takes her heavy leave A deadly groan like life and death's departing See who it isAnd now the battle's ended If friend or foe let him be gently usedRevoke that doom of mercy for 'tis Clifford Who not contented that he lopp'd the branch In hewing Rutland when his leaves put forth But set his murd'ring knife unto the root From whence that tender spray did sweetly spring I mean our princely father Duke of YorkFrom off the gates of York fetch down the head Your father's head which Clifford placed there Instead whereof let this supply the room Measure for measure must be answeredBring forth that fatal screechowl to our house That nothing sung but death to us and ours Now death shall stop his dismal threat'ning sound And his illboding tongue no more shall speakI think his understanding is bereft Speak Clifford dost thou know who speaks to thee Dark cloudy death o'ershades his beams of life And he nor sees nor hears us what we sayO would he did and so perhaps he doth 'Tis but his policy to counterfeit Because he would avoid such bitter taunts Which in the time of death he gave our fatherIf so thou think'st vex him with eager wordsClifford ask mercy and obtain no graceClifford repent in bootless penitenceClifford devise excuses for thy faultsWhile we devise fell tortures for thy faultsThou didst love York and I am son to YorkThou pitied'st Rutland I will pity theeWhere's Captain Margaret to fence you nowThey mock thee Clifford swear as thou wast wontWhat not an oath Nay then the world goes hard When Clifford cannot spare his friends an oath I know by that he's dead and by my soul If this right hand would buy two hours' life That I in all despite might rail at him This hand should chop it off and with the issuing blood Stifle the villain whose unstanched thirst York and young Rutland could not satisfyAy but he's dead Off with the traitor's head And rear it in the place your father's stands And now to London with triumphant march There to be crowned England's royal King From whence shall Warwick cut the sea to France And ask the Lady Bona for thy queen So shalt thou sinew both these lands together And having France thy friend thou shalt not dread The scatt'red foe that hopes to rise again For though they cannot greatly sting to hurt Yet look to have them buzz to offend thine ears First will I see the coronation And then to Brittany I'll cross the sea To effect this marriage so it please my lordEven as thou wilt sweet Warwick let it be For in thy shoulder do I build my seat And never will I undertake the thing Wherein thy counsel and consent is wanting Richard I will create thee Duke of Gloucester And George of Clarence Warwick as ourself Shall do and undo as him pleaseth bestLet me be Duke of Clarence George of Gloucester For Gloucester's dukedom is too ominousTut that's a foolish observation Richard be Duke of Gloucester Now to London To see these honours in possession
