The plains of PhilippiOctavius Antony and their ArmyNow Antony our hopes are answered You said the enemy would not come down But keep the hills and upper regions It proves not so Their battles are at hand They mean to warn us at Philippi here Answering before we do demand of themTut I am in their bosoms and I know Wherefore they do it They could be content To visit other places and come down With fearful bravery thinking by this face To fasten in our thoughts that they have courage But 'tis not soa MessengerPrepare you generals The enemy comes on in gallant show Their bloody sign of battle is hung out And something to be done immediatelyOctavius lead your battle softly on Upon the left hand of the even fieldUpon the right hand I keep thou the leftWhy do you cross me in this exigentI do not cross you but I will do so March DrumBrutus Cassius and their ArmyLucilius Titinius Messala and othersThey stand and would have parleyStand fast Titinius we must out and talkMark Antony shall we give sign of battleNo Caesar we will answer on their charge Make forth the generals would have some wordsStir not until the signal not until the signalWords before blows Is it so countrymenNot that we love words better as you doGood words are better than bad strokes OctaviusIn your bad strokes Brutus you give good words Witness the hole you made in Caesar's heart Crying Long live Hail CaesarAntony The posture of your blows are yet unknown But for your words they rob the Hybla bees And leave them honeylessNot stingless tooO yes and soundless too For you have stol'n their buzzing Antony And very wisely threat before you stingVillains You did not so when your vile daggers Hack'd one another in the sides of Caesar You show'd your teeth like apes and fawn'd like hounds And bow'd like bondmen kissing Caesar's feet Whilst damned Casca like a cur behind Strooke Caesar on the neck O you flatterersFlatterers Now Brutus thank yourself This tongue had not offended so today If Cassius might have ruledCome come the cause If arguing make us sweat The proof of it will turn to redder drops Look I draw a sword against conspirators When think you that the sword goes up again Never till Caesar's three and thirty wounds Be well avenged or till another Caesar Have added slaughter to the sword of traitorsCaesar thou canst not die by traitors' hands Unless thou bring'st them with theeSo I hope I was not born to die on Brutus' swordO if thou wert the noblest of thy strain Young man thou couldst not die more honorableA peevish school boy worthless of such honor Join'd with a masker and a revelerOld Cassius stillCome Antony away Defiance traitors hurl we in your teeth If you dare fight today come to the field If not when you have stomachsOctavius Antony and their ArmyWhy now blow and swell billow and swim bark The storm is up and all is on the hazardHo Lucilius Hark a word with youStands forth My lordBrutus and Lucilius converse apartMessalaStands forth What says my generalMessala This is my birthday as this very day Was Cassius born Give me thy hand Messala Be thou my witness that against my will As Pompey was am I compell'd to set Upon one battle all our liberties You know that I held Epicurus strong And his opinion Now I change my mind And partly credit things that do presage Coming from Sardis on our former ensign Two mighty eagles fell and there they perch'd Gorging and feeding from our soldiers' hands Who to Philippi here consorted us This morning are they fled away and gone And in their steads do ravens crows and kites Fly o'er our heads and downward look on us As we were sickly prey Their shadows seem A canopy most fatal under which Our army lies ready to give up the ghostBelieve not soI but believe it partly For I am fresh of spirit and resolved To meet all perils very constantlyEven so LuciliusNow most noble Brutus The gods today stand friendly that we may Lovers in peace lead on our days to age But since the affairs of men rest still incertain Let's reason with the worst that may befall If we do lose this battle then is this The very last time we shall speak together What are you then determined to doEven by the rule of that philosophy By which I did blame Cato for the death Which he did give himself I know not how But I do find it cowardly and vile For fear of what might fall so to prevent The time of life arming myself with patience To stay the providence of some high powers That govern us belowThen if we lose this battle You are contented to be led in triumph Thorough the streets of RomeNo Cassius no Think not thou noble Roman That ever Brutus will go bound to Rome He bears too great a mind But this same day Must end that work the ides of March begun And whether we shall meet again I know not Therefore our everlasting farewell take Forever and forever farewell Cassius If we do meet again why we shall smile If not why then this parting was well madeForever and forever farewell Brutus If we do meet again we'll smile indeed If not 'tis true this parting was well madeWhy then lead on O that a man might know The end of this day's business ere it come But it sufficeth that the day will end And then the end is known Come ho Away The field of battle AlarumBrutus and MessalaRide ride Messala ride and give these bills Unto the legions on the other side Loud alarum Let them set on at once for I perceive But cold

note of him Re Titinius with MessalaIt is but change Titinius for Octavius Is overthrown by noble Brutus' power As Cassius' legions are by AntonyThese tidings would well comfort CassiusWhere did you leave himAll disconsolate With Pindarus his bondman on this hillIs not that he that lies upon the groundHe lies not like the living O my heartIs not that heNo this was he Messala But Cassius is no more O setting sun As in thy red rays thou dost sink to night So in his red blood Cassius' day is set The sun of Rome is set Our day is gone Clouds dews and dangers come our deeds are done Mistrust of my success hath done this deedMistrust of good success hath done this deed O hateful error melancholy's child Why dost thou show to the apt thoughts of men The things that are not O error soon conceived Thou never comest unto a happy birth But kill'st the mother that engender'd theeWhat Pindarus Where art thou PindarusSeek him Titinius whilst I go to meet The noble Brutus thrusting this report Into his ears I may say thrusting it For piercing steel and darts envenomed Shall be as welcome to the ears of Brutus As tidings of this sightHie you Messala And I will seek for Pindarus the while Messala Why didst thou send me forth brave Cassius Did I not meet thy friends And did not they Put on my brows this wreath of victory And bid me give it thee Didst thou not hear their shouts Alas thou hast misconstrued everything But hold thee take this garland on thy brow Thy Brutus bid me give it thee and I Will do his bidding Brutus come apace And see how I regarded Caius Cassius By
