personYea in truth my lordPray thee peace Pay her the debt you owe her and unpay the villainy you have done with her the one you may do with sterling money and the other with current repentanceMy lord

your suitor I say to you I do desire deliverance from these officers being upon hasty employment in the King's affairsYou speak as having power to do wrong but answer in th' effect of your reputation

drinking and for thy walls a pretty slight drollery or the story of the Prodigal or the German hunting in waterwork is worth a thousand of these bedhangers and these flybitten tapestries Let it be ten

was a fool that taught them me This is the right fencing grace my lord tap for tap and so part fairNow the Lord lighten thee Thou art a great fool London Another streetand Before God I am exceeding wearyIs't come to that I had thought weariness durst not have attach'd one of so high bloodFaith it does me though it discolours the complexion of my greatness to acknowledge it Doth it not show vilely in me to desire small beerWhy a prince should not be so loosely studied as to remember so weak a compositionBelike then my appetite was notprincely got for by my troth I do now remember the poor creature small beer But indeed these humble considerations make me out of love with my greatness What a disgrace is it to me to remember thy name or to know thy face tomorrow or to take note how many pair of silk stockings thou hast viz these and those that were thy peachcolour'd ones or to bear the inventory of thy shirts as one for superfluity and another for use But that the tenniscourtkeeper knows better than I for it is a low ebb of linen with thee when thou keepest not racket there as thou hast not done a great while because the rest of thy low countries have made a shift to eat up thy holland And God knows whether those that bawl out of the ruins of thy linen shall inherit his kingdom but the midwives say the children are not in the fault whereupon the world increases and kindreds are mightily strengthenedHow ill it follows after you have laboured so hard you should talk so idly Tell me how many good young princes would do so their fathers being so sick as yours at this time isShall I tell thee one thing PoinsYes faith and let it be an excellent good thingIt shall serve among wits of no higher breeding than thineGo to I stand the push of your one thing that you will tellMarry I tell thee it is not meet that I should be sad now my father is sick albeit I could tell to thee as to one it pleases me for fault of a better to call my friend I could be sad and sad indeed tooVery hardly upon such a subjectBy this hand thou thinkest me as far in the devil's book as thou and Falstaff for obduracy and persistency let the end try the man But I tell thee my heart bleeds inwardly that my father is so sick and keeping such vile company as thou art hath in reason taken from me all ostentation of sorrowThe reasonWhat wouldst thou think of me if I should weepI would think thee a most princely hypocriteIt would be every man's thought and thou art a blessed fellow to think as every man thinks Never a man's thought in the world keeps the roadway better than thine Every man would think me an hypocrite indeed And what accites your most worshipful thought to think soWhy because you have been so lewd and so much engraffed to FalstaffAnd to theeBy this light I am well spoke on I can hear it with mine own ears The worst that they can say of me is that I am a second brother and that I am a proper fellow of my hands and those two things I confess I cannot help By the mass here comes Bardolph and And the boy that I gave Falstaff 'A had him from me Christian and look if the fat villain have not transform'd him apeGod save your GraceAnd yours most noble BardolphCome you virtuous ass you bashful fool must you be blushing Wherefore blush you now What a maidenly manatarms are you become Is't such a matter to get a pottlepot's maidenhead'A calls me e'en now my lord through a red lattice and I could discern no part of his face from the window At last I spied his eyes and methought he had made two holes in the alewife's new petticoat and so peep'd throughHas not the boy profitedAway you whoreson upright rabbit awayAway you rascally Althaea's dream awayInstruct us boy what dream boyMarry my lord Althaea dreamt she was delivered of a firebrand and therefore I call him her dreamA crown's worth of good interpretation There 'tis boy Giving a crownO that this blossom could be kept from cankers Well there is sixpence to preserve theeAn you do not make him be hang'd among you the gallows shall have wrongAnd how doth thy master BardolphWell my lord He heard of your Grace's coming to town There's a letter for youDeliver'd with good respect And how doth the martlemas your masterIn bodily health sirMarry the immortal part needs a physician but that moves not him Though that be sick it dies notI do allow this well to be as familiar with me as my dog and he holds his place for look you how he writes Reads'John Falstaff knight' Every man must know that as oft as he has occasion to name himself even like those that are kin to the King for they never prick their finger but they say 'There's some of the King's blood spilt' 'How comes that' says he that takes upon him not to conceive The answer is as ready as a borrower's cap 'I am the King's poor cousin sir'Nay they will be kin to us or they will fetch it from Japhet But the letterReadsir John Falstaff knight to the son of the King nearest his father Harry Prince of Wales greeting'Why this is a certificatePeaceReads'I will imitate the honourable Romans in brevity'He sure means brevity in breath shortwinded Reads'I commend me to thee I commend thee and I leave thee Be not too familiar with Poins for he misuses thy favours so much that he swears thou art to marry his sister Nell Repent at idle times as thou mayst and so farewell Thine by yea and no which is as much as to say as thou usest him with my familiars with my brothers and sisters and with all Europe'My lord I'll steep this letter in sack and make him eat itThat's to make him eat twenty of his words But do you use me thus Ned Must I marry your sisterGod send the wench no worse fortune But I never said soWell thus we play the fools with the time and the spirits of the wise sit in the clouds and mock

tongue sirAnd for mine sir I will govern itFare you well goThis Doll Tearsheet should be some roadI warrant you as common as the way between Saint Albans and LondonHow might we see Falstaff bestow himself tonight in his true colours and not ourselves be seenPut on two leathern jerkins and aprons and wait upon him at his table as drawersFrom a god to a bull A heavy descension It was Jove's case From a prince to a prentice A low transformation That shall be mine for in everything the purpose must weigh with the folly Follow me Ned Warkworth Before the castleand I pray thee loving wife and gentle daughter Give even way unto my rough affairs Put not you on the visage of the times And be like them to Percy troublesomeI have given over I will speak no more Do what you will your wisdom be your guideAlas sweet wife my honour is at pawn And but my going nothing can redeem itO yet for God's sake go not to these wars The time was father that you broke your word When you were more endear'd to it than now When your own Percy when my heart's dear Harry Threw many a northward look to see his father Bring up his powers but he did long in vain Who then persuaded you to stay at home There were two honours lost yours and your son's For yours the God of heaven brighten it For his it stuck upon him as the sun In the grey vault of heaven and by his light Did all the chivalry of England move To do brave acts He was indeed the glass Wherein the noble youth did dress themselves He had no legs that practis'd not his gait And speaking thick which nature made his blemish Became the accents of the valiant For those who could speak low and tardily Would turn their own perfection to abuse To seem like him so that in speech in gait In diet in affections of delight In military rules humours of blood He was the mark and glass copy and book That fashion'd others And him O wondrous him O miracle of men him did you leave Second to none unseconded by you To look upon the hideous god of war In disadvantage to abide a field Where nothing but the sound of Hotspur's name Did seem defensible So you left him Never O never do his ghost the wrong To hold your honour more precise and nice With others than with him Let them alone The Marshal and the Archbishop are strong Had my sweet Harry had but half their numbers Today might I hanging on Hotspur's neck Have talk'd of Monmouth's graveBeshrew your heart Fair daughter you do draw my spirits from me With new lamenting ancient oversights But I must go and meet with danger there Or it will seek me in another place And find me worse providedO fly to Scotland Till that the nobles and the armed commons Have of their puissance made a little tasteIf they get ground and vantage of the King Then join you with them like a rib of steel To make strength stronger but for all our loves First let them try themselves So did your son He was so suff'red so came I a widow And never shall have length of life enough To rain upon remembrance with mine eyes That it may grow and sprout as high as heaven For recordation to my noble husbandCome come go in with me 'Tis with my mind As with the tide swell'd up unto his height That makes a stillstand running neither way Fain would I go to meet the Archbishop But many thousand reasons hold me back I will resolve for Scotland There am I Till time and vantage crave my company
