devil in an everlasting garment hath him One whose hard heart is button'd up with steel A fiend a fairy pitiless and rough A wolf nay worse a fellow all in buff A backfriend a shoulderclapper one that countermands The passages of alleys creeks and narrow lands A hound that runs counter and yet draws dryfoot well One that before the Judgment carries poor souls to hellWhy man what is the matter I do

chain a chain Do you not hear it ringWhat the chain No no the bell 'tis time that I were gone It was two ere I left him and now the clock strikes oneThe hours come back That did I never hear O yes If any hour meet a sergeant 'a turns back for very fearAs if Time were in debt How fondly dost thou reason Time is a very bankrupt and owes more than he's worth to season Nay he's a thief too have you not heard men say That Time comes stealing on by night and day If 'a be in debt and theft and a sergeant in the way Hath he not reason to turn back an hour in a day Re with a purseGo Dromio there's the money bear it straight And bring thy master home immediately Come sister I am press'd down with conceit Conceit my comfort and my injury The martThere's not a man I meet but doth salute me As if I were their wellacquainted friend And every one doth call me by my name Some tender money to me some invite me Some other give me thanks for kindnesses Some offer me commodities to buy Even now a tailor call'd me in his shop And show'd me silks that he had bought for me And therewithal took measure of my body Sure these are but imaginary wiles And Lapland sorcerers inhabit hereMaster here's the gold you sent me for What have you got the picture of old Adam newapparell'd What gold is this What Adam dost thou mean Not that Adam that kept the Paradise but that Adam that keeps the prison he that goes in the calf's skin that was kill'd for the Prodigal he that came behind you sir like an evil angel and bid you forsake your liberty I understand thee not No Why 'tis a plain case he that went like a bassviol in a case of leather the man sir that when gentlemen are tired gives them a sob and rest them he sir that takes pity on decayed men and give them suits of durance he that sets up his rest to do more exploits with his mace than a morrispike What thou mean'st an officer Ay sir the sergeant of the band that brings any man to answer it that breaks his band on that thinks a man always going to bed and says 'God give you good rest' Well sir there rest in your foolery Is there any ship puts forth tonight May we be gone Why sir I brought you word an hour since that the bark Expedition put forth tonight and then were you hind'red by the sergeant to tarry for the boy Delay Here are the angels that you sent for to deliver you The fellow is distract and so am I And here we wander in illusions Some blessed power deliver us from hencea Well met well met Master Antipholus I see sir you have found the goldsmith now Is that the chain you promis'd me today Satan avoid I charge thee tempt me not Master is this Mistress Satan It is the devil Nay she is worse she is the devil's dam and here she comes in the habit of a light wench and thereof comes that the wenches say 'God damn me' That's as much to say 'God make me a light wench' It is written they appear to men like angels of light light is an effect of fire and fire will burn ergo light wenches will burn Come not near herYour man and you are marvellous merry sir Will you go with me We'll mend our dinner here Master if you do expect spoonmeat or bespeak a long spoon Why Dromio Marry he must have a long spoon that must eat with the devil Avoid then fiend What tell'st thou me of supping Thou art as you are all a sorceress I conjure thee to leave me and be goneGive me the ring of mine you had at dinner Or for my diamond the chain you promis'd And I'll be gone sir and not trouble you Some devils ask but the parings of one's nail A rush a hair a drop of blood a pin A nut a cherrystone But she more covetous would have a chain Master be wise an if you give it her The devil will shake her chain and fright us with itI pray you sir my ring or else the chain I hope you do not mean to cheat me so Avaunt thou witch Come Dromio let us go 'Fly pride' says the peacock Mistress that you know andNow out of doubt Antipholus is mad Else would he never so demean himself A ring he hath of mine worth forty ducats And for the same he promis'd me a chain Both one and other he denies me now The reason that I gather he is mad Besides this present instance of his rage Is a mad tale he told today at dinner Of his own doors being shut against his entrance Belike his wife acquainted with his fits On purpose shut the doors against his way My way is now to hie home to his house And tell his wife that being lunatic He rush'd into my house and took perforce My ring away This course I fittest choose For forty ducats is too much to lose A street with theFear me not man I will not break away I'll give

'ears I have served him from the hour of my nativity to this instant and have nothing at his hands for my service but blows When I am cold he heats me with beating when I am warm he cools me with beating I am wak'd with it when I sleep rais'd with it when I sit driven out of doors with it when I go from home welcom'd home with it when I return nay I bear it on my shoulders as beggar wont her brat and I think when he hath lam'd me I shall beg with it from door to doortheand acall'dCome go along my wife is coming yonder Mistress 'respice finem' respect your end or rather to prophesy like
