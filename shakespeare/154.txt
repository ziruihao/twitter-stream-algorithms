London Ely Housesick with the etcWill the King come that I may breathe my last In wholesome counsel to his unstaid youthVex not yourself nor strive not with your breath For all in vain comes counsel to his earO but they say the tongues of dying men Enforce attention like deep harmony Where words are scarce they are seldom spent in vain For they breathe truth that breathe their words in pain He that no more must say is listen'd more Than they whom youth and ease have taught to glose More are men's ends mark'd than their lives before The setting sun and music at the close As the last taste of sweets is sweetest last Writ in remembrance more than things long past Though Richard my life's counsel would not hear My death's sad tale may yet undeaf his earNo it is stopp'd with other flattering sounds As praises of whose taste the wise are fond Lascivious metres to whose venom sound The open ear of youth doth always listen Report of fashions in proud Italy Whose manners still our tardy apish nation Limps after in base imitation Where doth the world thrust forth a vanity So it be new there's no respect how vile That is not quickly buzz'd into his ears Then all too late comes counsel to be heard Where will doth mutiny with wit's regard Direct not him whose way himself will choose 'Tis breath thou lack'st and that breath wilt thou loseMethinks I am a prophet new inspir'd And thus expiring do foretell of him His rash fierce blaze of riot cannot last For violent fires soon burn out themselves Small showers last long but sudden storms are short He tires betimes that spurs too fast betimes With eager feeding food doth choke the feeder Light vanity insatiate cormorant Consuming means soon preys upon itself This royal throne of kings this scept'red isle This earth of majesty this seat of Mars This other Eden demiparadise This fortress built by Nature for herself Against infection and the hand of war This happy breed of men this little world This precious stone set in the silver sea Which serves it in the office of a wall Or as a moat defensive to a house Against the envy of less happier lands This blessed plot this earth this realm this England This nurse this teeming womb of royal kings Fear'd by their breed and famous by their birth Renowned for their deeds as far from home For Christian service and true chivalry As is the sepulchre in stubborn Jewry Of the world's ransom blessed Mary's Son This land of such dear souls this dear dear land Dear for her reputation through the world Is now leas'd outI die pronouncing it Like to a tenement or pelting farm England bound in with the triumphant sea Whose rocky shore beats back the envious siege Of wat'ry Neptune is now bound in with shame With inky blots and rotten parchment bonds That England that was wont to conquer others Hath made a shameful conquest of itself Ah would the scandal vanish with my life How happy then were my ensuing deathandRoss and The King is come deal mildly with his youth For young hot colts being rag'd do rage the moreHow fares our noble uncle LancasterWhat comfort man How is't with aged GauntO how that name befits my composition Old Gaunt indeed and gaunt in being old Within me grief hath kept a tedious fast And who abstains from meat that is not gaunt For sleeping England long time have I watch'd Watching breeds leanness leanness is an gaunt The pleasure that some fathers feed upon Is my strict fastI mean my children's looks And therein fasting hast thou made me gaunt Gaunt am I for the grave gaunt as a grave Whose hollow womb inherits nought but bonesCan sick men play so nicely with their namesNo misery makes sport to mock itself Since thou dost seek to kill my name in me I mock my name great king to flatter theeShould dying men flatter with those that liveNo no men living flatter those that dieThou now adying sayest thou flatterest meO no thou diest though I the sicker beI am in health I breathe and see thee illNow He that made me knows I see thee ill Ill in myself to see and in thee seeing ill Thy deathbed is no lesser than thy land Wherein thou liest in reputation sick And thou too careless patient as thou art Commit'st thy anointed body to the cure Of those physicians that first wounded thee A thousand flatterers sit within thy crown Whose compass is no bigger than thy head And yet incaged in so small a verge The waste is no whit lesser than thy land O had thy grandsire with a prophet's eye Seen how his son's son should destroy his sons From forth thy reach he would have laid thy shame Deposing thee before thou wert possess'd Which art possess'd now to depose thyself Why cousin wert thou regent of the world It were a shame to let this land by lease But for thy world enjoying but this land Is it not more than shame to shame it so Landlord of England art thou now not King Thy state of law is bondslave to the law And thouA lunatic leanwitted fool Presuming on an ague's privilege Darest with thy frozen admonition Make pale our cheek chasing the royal blood With fury from his native residence Now by my seat's right royal majesty Wert thou not brother to great Edward's son This tongue that runs so roundly in thy head Should run thy head from thy unreverent shouldersO Spare me not my brother Edward's son For that I was his father Edward's son That blood already like the pelican Hast thou tapp'd out and drunkenly carous'd My brother Gloucester plain wellmeaning soul Whom fair befall in heaven 'mongst happy souls May be a precedent and witness good That thou respect'st not spilling Edward's blood Join with the present sickness that I have And thy unkindness be like crooked age To crop at once a too long withered flower Live in thy shame but die not shame with thee These words hereafter thy tormentors be Convey me to my bed then to my grave Love they to live that love and honour have borne out by his attendantsAnd let them die that age and sullens have For both hast thou and both become the graveI do beseech your Majesty impute his words To wayward sickliness and age in him He loves you on my life and holds you dear As Harry Duke of Hereford were he hereRight you say true as Hereford's love so his As theirs so mine and all be as it isMy liege old Gaunt commends him to your MajestyWhat says heNay nothing all is said His tongue is now a stringless instrument Words life and all old Lancaster hath spentBe York the next that must be bankrupt so Though death be poor it ends a mortal woeThe ripest fruit first falls and so doth he His time is spent our pilgrimage must be So much for that Now for our Irish wars We must supplant those rough rugheaded kerns Which live like venom where no venom else But only they have privilege to live And for these great affairs do ask some charge Towards our assistance we do seize to us The plate coin revenues and moveables Whereof our uncle Gaunt did stand possess'dHow long shall I be patient Ah how long Shall tender duty make me suffer wrong Not Gloucester's death nor Hereford's banishment Nor Gaunt's rebukes nor England's private wrongs Nor the prevention of poor Bolingbroke About his marriage nor my own disgrace Have ever made me sour my patient cheek Or bend one wrinkle on my sovereign's face I am the last of noble Edward's sons Of whom thy father Prince of Wales was first In war was never lion rag'd more fierce In peace was never gentle lamb more mild Than was that young and princely gentleman His face thou hast for even so look'd he Accomplish'd with the number of thy hours But when he frown'd it was against the French And not against his friends His noble hand Did win what he did spend and spent not that Which his triumphant father's hand had won His hands were guilty of no kindred blood But bloody with the enemies of his kin O Richard York is too far gone with grief Or else he never would compare betweenWhy uncle what's the matterO my liege Pardon me if you please if not I pleas'd Not to be pardoned am content withal Seek you to seize and gripe into your hands The royalties and rights of banish'd Hereford Is not Gaunt dead and doth not Hereford live Was not Gaunt just and is not Harry true Did not the one deserve to have an heir Is not his heir a welldeserving son Take Hereford's rights away and take from Time His charters and his customary rights Let not tomorrow then ensue today Be not thyselffor how art thou a king But by fair sequence and succession Now afore GodGod forbid I say true If you do wrongfully seize Hereford's rights Call in the letters patents that he hath By his attorneysgeneral to sue His livery and deny his off'red homage You pluck a thousand dangers on your head You lose a thousand welldisposed hearts And prick my tender patience to those thoughts Which honour and allegiance cannot thinkThink what you will we seize into our hands His plate his goods his money and his landsI'll not be by the while My liege farewell What will ensue hereof there's none can tell But by bad courses may be understood That their events can never fall out goodGo Bushy to the Earl of Wiltshire straight Bid him repair to us to Ely House To see this business Tomorrow next We will for Ireland and 'tis time I trow And we create in absence of ourself Our Uncle York Lord Governor of England For he is just and always lov'd us well Come on our queen tomorrow must we part Be merry for our time of stay is shortFlourish and Well lords the Duke of Lancaster is dead Ross And living too for now his son is DukeBarely in title not in revenuesRichly in both if justice had her rightMy heart is great but it must break with silence Ere't be disburdened with a liberal tongueNay speak thy mind and let him ne'er speak more That speaks thy words again to do thee harmTends that thou wouldst speak to the Duke of Hereford If it be so out with it boldly man Quick is mine ear to hear of good towards himNo good at all that I can do for him Unless you call it good to pity him Bereft and gelded of his patrimonyNow afore God 'tis shame such wrongs are borne In him a royal prince and many moe Of noble blood in this declining land The King is not himself but basely led By flatterers and what they will inform Merely in hate 'gainst any of us an That will the King severely prosecute 'Gainst us our lives our children and our heirsThe commons hath he pill'd with grievous taxes And quite lost their hearts the nobles hath he find For ancient quarrels and quite lost their heartsAnd daily new exactions are devis'd As blanks benevolences and I wot not what But what a God's name doth become of thisWars hath not wasted it for warr'd he hath not But basely yielded upon compromise That which his noble ancestors achiev'd with blows More hath he spent in peace than they in warsThe Earl of Wiltshire hath the realm in farmThe King's grown bankrupt like a broken manReproach and dissolution hangeth over himHe hath not money for these Irish wars His burdenous taxations notwithstanding But by the robbing of the banish'd DukeHis noble kinsmanmost degenerate king But lords we hear this fearful tempest sing Yet seek no shelter to avoid the storm We see the wind sit sore upon our sails And yet we strike not but securely perishWe see the very wreck that we must suffer And unavoided is the danger now For suffering so the causes of our wreckNot so even through the hollow eyes of death I spy life peering but I dare not say How near the tidings of our comfort isNay let us share thy thoughts as thou dost oursBe confident to speak Northumberland We three are but thyself and speaking so Thy words are but as thoughts therefore be boldThen thus I have from Le Port Blanc a bay In Brittany receiv'd intelligence That Harry Duke of Hereford Rainold Lord Cobham That late broke from the Duke of Exeter His brother Archbishop late of Canterbury Sir Thomas Erpingham Sir John Ramston Sir John Norbery Sir Robert Waterton and Francis Quoint All these well furnish'd by the Duke of Britaine With eight tall ships three thousand men of war Are making hither with all due expedience And shortly mean to touch our northern shore Perhaps they had ere this but that they stay The first departing of the King for Ireland If then we shall shake off our slavish yoke Imp out our drooping country's broken wing Redeem from broking pawn the blemish'd crown Wipe off the dust that hides our sceptre's gilt And make high majesty look like itself Away with me in post to Ravenspurgh But if you faint as fearing to do so Stay and be secret and myself will goTo horse to horse Urge doubts to them that fearHold out my horse and I will first be thereWindsor Castleand Madam your Majesty is too much sad You promis'd when you parted with the King To lay aside lifeharming heaviness And tain a cheerful dispositionTo please the King I did to please myself I cannot do it yet I know no cause Why I should welcome such a guest as grief Save bidding farewell to so sweet a guest As my sweet Richard Yet again methinks Some unborn sorrow ripe in fortune's womb Is coming towards me and my inward soul With nothing trembles At some thing it grieves More than with parting from my lord the KingEach substance of a grief hath twenty shadows Which shows like grief itself but is not so For sorrow's eye glazed with blinding tears Divides one thing entire to many objects Like perspectives which rightly gaz'd upon Show nothing but confusioney'd awry Distinguish form So your sweet Majesty Looking awry upon your lord's departure Find shapes of grief more than himself to wail Which look'd on as it is is nought but shadows Of what it is not Then thricegracious Queen More than your lord's departure weep notmore is not seen Or if it be 'tis with false sorrow's eye Which for things true weeps things imaginaryIt may be so but yet my inward soul Persuades me it is otherwise Howe'er it be I cannot but be sad so heavy sad Asthough on thinking on no thought I think Makes me with heavy nothing faint and shrink'Tis nothing but conceit my gracious lady'Tis nothing less conceit is still deriv'd From some forefather grief mine is not so For nothing hath begot my something grief Or something hath the nothing that I grieve 'Tis in reversion that I do possess But what it is that is not yet known what I cannot name 'tis nameless woe I wot God save your Majesty and well met gentlemen I hope the King is not yet shipp'd for IrelandWhy hopest thou so 'Tis better hope he is For his designs crave haste his haste good hope Then wherefore dost thou hope he is not shipp'dThat he our hope might have retir'd his power And driven into despair an enemy's hope Who strongly hath set footing in this land The banish'd Bolingbroke repeals himself And with uplifted arms is safe arriv'd At RavenspurghNow God in heaven forbidAh madam 'tis too true and that is worse The Lord Northumberland his son young Henry Percy The Lords of Ross Beaumond and Willoughby With all their powerful friends are fled to himWhy have you not proclaim'd Northumberland And all the rest revolted faction traitorsWe have whereupon the Earl of Worcester Hath broken his staff resign'd his stewardship And all the household servants fled with him To BolingbrokeSo Green thou art the midwife to my woe And Bolingbroke my sorrow's dismal heir Now hath my soul brought forth her prodigy And I a gasping newdeliver'd mother Have woe to woe sorrow to sorrow join'dDespair not madamWho shall hinder me I will despair and be at enmity With cozening hopehe is a flatterer A parasite a keeperback of death Who gently would dissolve the bands of life Which false hope lingers in extremityHere comes the Duke of YorkWith signs of war about his aged neck O full of careful business are his looks Uncle for God's sake speak comfortable wordsShould I do so I should belie my thoughts Comfort's in heaven and we are on the earth Where nothing lives but crosses cares and grief Your husband he is gone to save far off Whilst others come to make him lose at home Here am I left to underprop his land Who weak with age cannot support myself Now comes the sick hour that his surfeit made Now shall he try his friends that flatter'd him a My lord your son was gone before I cameHe waswhy so go all which way it will The nobles they are fled the commons they are cold And will I fear revolt on Hereford's side Sirrah get thee to Plashy to my sister Gloucester Bid her send me presently a thousand pound Hold take my ringMy lord I had forgot to tell your lordship Today as I came by I called there But I shall grieve you to report the restWhat is't knaveAn hour before I came the Duchess diedGod for his mercy what a tide of woes Comes rushing on this woeful land at once I know not what to do I would to God So my untruth had not provok'd him to it The King had cut off my head with my brother's What are there no posts dispatch'd for Ireland How shall we do for money for these wars Come sistercousin I would saypray pardon me Go fellow get thee home provide some carts And bring away the armour that is thereGentlemen will you go muster men If I know how or which way to order these affairs Thus disorderly thrust into my hands Never believe me Both are my kinsmen T'one is my sovereign whom both my oath And duty bids defend t'other again Is my kinsman whom the King hath wrong'd Whom conscience and my kindred bids to right Well somewhat we must doCome cousin I'll dispose of you Gentlemen go muster up your men And meet me presently at Berkeley I should to Plashy too But time will not permit All is uneven And everything is left at six and seven The wind sits fair for news to go to Ireland But none returns For us to levy power Proportionable to the enemy Is all unpossibleBesides our nearness to the King in love Is near the hate of those love not the KingAnd that is the wavering commons for their love Lies in their purses and whoso empties them By so much fills their hearts with deadly hateWherein the King stands generally condemn'dIf judgment lie in them then so do we Because we ever have been near the KingWell I will for refuge straight to Bristow Castle The Earl of Wiltshire is already thereThither will I with you for little office Will the hateful commons perform for us Except Eke curs to tear us all to pieces Will you go along with usNo I will to Ireland to his Majesty Farewell If heart's presages be not vain We three here part that ne'er shall meet againThat's as York thrives to beat back BolingbrokeAlas poor Duke the task he undertakes Is numb'ring sands and drinking oceans dry Where one on his side fights thousands will fly Farewell at oncefor once for all and everWell we may meet againI fear me never GloucestershireandforcesHow far is it my lord to Berkeley nowBelieve me noble lord I am a stranger here in Gloucestershire These high wild hills and rough uneven ways Draws out our miles and makes them wearisome And yet your fair discourse hath been as sugar Making the hard way sweet and delectable But I bethink me what a weary way From Ravenspurgh to Cotswold will be found In Ross and Willoughby wanting your company Which I protest hath very much beguil'd The tediousness and process of my travel But theirs is sweet'ned with the hope to have The present benefit which I possess And hope to joy is little less in joy Than hope enjoy'd By this the weary lords Shall make their way seem short as mine hath done By sight of what I have your noble companyOf much less value is my company Than your good words But who comes here It is my son young Harry Percy Sent from my brother Worcester whencesoever Harry how fares your uncleI had thought my lord to have learn'd his health of youWhy is he not with the QueenNo my good lord he hath forsook the court Broken his staff of office and dispers'd The household of the KingWhat was his reason He was not so resolv'd when last we spake togetherBecause your lordship was proclaimed traitor But he my lord is gone to Ravenspurgh To offer service to the Duke of Hereford And sent me over by Berkeley to discover What power the Duke of York had levied there Then with directions to repair to RavenspurghHave you forgot the Duke of Hereford boyNo my good lord for that is not forgot Which ne'er I did remember to my knowledge I never in my life did look on himThen learn to know him now this is the DukeMy gracious lord I tender you my service Such as it is being tender raw and young Which elder days shall ripen and confirm To more approved service and desertI thank thee gentle Percy and be sure I count myself in nothing else so happy As in a soul rememb'ring my good friends And as my fortune ripens with thy love It shall be still thy true love's recompense My heart this covenant makes my hand thus seals itHow far is it to Berkeley And what stir Keeps good old York there with his men of warThere stands the castle by yon tuft of trees Mann'd with three hundred men as I have heard And in it are the Lords of York Berkeley and Seymour None else of name and noble estimateRoss and Here come the Lords of Ross and Willoughby Bloody with spurring fieryred with hasteWelcome my lords I wot your love pursues A banish'd traitor All my treasury Is yet but unfelt thanks which more enrich'd Shall be your love and labour's recompenseYour presence makes us rich most noble lordAnd far surmounts our labour to attain itEvermore thanks the exchequer of the poor Which till my infant fortune comes to years Stands for my bounty But who comes here It is my Lord of Berkeley as I guessMy Lord of Hereford my message is to youMy lord my answer is'to Lancaster' And I am come to seek that name in England And I must find that title in your tongue Before I make reply to aught you sayMistake me not my lord 'tis not my meaning To raze one title of your honour out To you my lord I comewhat lord you will From the most gracious regent of this land The Duke of York to know what pricks you on To take advantage of the absent time And fright our native peace with selfborne armsattendedI shall not need transport my words by you Here comes his Grace in person My noble uncleKneelsShow me thy humble heart and not thy knee Whose duty is deceivable and falseMy gracious uncleTut tut Grace me no grace nor uncle me no uncle I am no traitor's uncle and that word 'grace' In an ungracious mouth is but profane Why have those banish'd and forbidden legs Dar'd once to touch a dust of England's ground But then more 'why'why have they dar'd to march So many miles upon her peaceful bosom Frighting her palefac'd villages with war And ostentation of despised arms Com'st thou because the anointed King is hence Why foolish boy the King is left behind And in my loyal bosom lies his power Were I but now lord of such hot youth As when brave Gaunt thy father and myself Rescued the Black Prince that young Mars of men From forth the ranks of many thousand French O then how quickly should this arm of mine Now prisoner to the palsy chastise the And minister correction to thy fault My gracious uncle let me know my fault On what condition stands it and whereinEven in condition of the worst degree In gross rebellion and detested treason Thou art a banish'd man and here art come Before the expiration of thy time In braving arms against thy sovereignAs I was banish'd I was banish'd Hereford But as I come I come for Lancaster And noble uncle I beseech your Grace Look on my wrongs with an indifferent eye You are my father for methinks in you I see old Gaunt alive O then my father Will you permit that I shall stand condemn'd A wandering vagabond my rights and royalties Pluck'd from my arms perforce and given away To upstart unthrifts Wherefore was I born If that my cousin king be King in England It must be granted I am Duke of Lancaster You have a son Aumerle my noble cousin Had you first died and he been thus trod down He should have found his uncle Gaunt a father To rouse his wrongs and chase them to the bay I am denied to sue my livery here And yet my letters patents give me leave My father's goods are all distrain'd and sold And these and all are all amiss employ'd What would you have me do I am a subject And I challenge lawattorneys are denied me And therefore personally I lay my claim To my inheritance of free descentThe noble Duke hath been too much abusedIt stands your Grace upon to do him rightBase men by his endowments are made greatMy lords of England let me tell you this I have had feeling of my cousin's wrongs And labour'd all I could to do him right But in this kind to come in braving arms Be his own carver and cut out his way To find out right with wrongit may not be And you that do abet him in this kind Cherish rebellion and are rebels allThe noble Duke hath sworn his coming is But for his own and for the right of that We all have strongly sworn to give him aid And let him never see joy that breaks that oathWell well I see the issue of these arms I cannot mend it I must needs confess Because my power is weak and all ill left But if I could by Him that gave me life I would attach you all and make you stoop Unto the sovereign mercy of the King But since I cannot be it known unto you I do remain as neuter So fare you well Unless you please toin the castle And there repose you for this nightAn offer uncle that we will accept But we must win your Grace to go with us To Bristow Castle which they say is held By Bushy Bagot and their complices The caterpillars of the commonwealth Which I have sworn to weed and pluck awayIt may be I will go with you but yet I'll pause For I am loath to break our country's laws Nor friends nor foes to me welcome you are Things past redress are now with me past care A camp in Wales and a My Lord of Salisbury we have stay'd ten days And hardly kept our countrymen together And yet we hear no tidings from the King Therefore we will disperse ourselves FarewellStay yet another day thou trusty Welshman The King reposeth all his confidence in thee'Tis thought the King is dead we will not stay The bay trees in our country are all wither'd And meteors fright the fixed stars of heaven The palefac'd moon looks bloody on the earth And leanlook'd prophets whisper fearful change Rich men look sad and ruffians dance and leap The one in fear to lose what they enjoy The other to enjoy by rage and war These signs forerun the death or fall of kings Farewell Our countrymen are gone and fled As well assur'd Richard their King is dead Ah Richard with the eyes of heavy mind I see thy glory like a shooting star Fall to the base earth from the firmament The sun sets weeping in the lowly west Witnessing storms to come woe and unrest Thy friends are fled to wait upon thy foes And crossly to thy good all fortune goes
