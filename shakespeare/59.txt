France Before Harfleur Alarumthe and soldiers with scalingladdersOnce more unto the breach dear friends once more Or close the wall up with our English dead In peace there's nothing so becomes a man As modest stillness and humility But when the blast of war blows in our ears Then imitate the action of the tiger Stiffen the sinews summon up the blood Disguise fair nature with hardfavour'd rage Then lend the eye a terrible aspect Let it pry through the portage of the head Like the brass cannon let the brow o'erwhelm it As fearfully as doth a galled rock O'erhang and jutty his confounded base Swill'd with the wild and wasteful ocean Now set the teeth and stretch the nostril wide Hold hard the breath and bend up every spirit To his full height On on you noblest English Whose blood is fet from fathers of warproof Fathers that like so many Alexanders Have in these parts from morn till even fought And sheath'd their swords for lack of argument Dishonour not your mothers now attest That those whom you call'd fathers did beget you Be copy now to men of grosser blood And teach them how to war And you good yeomen Whose limbs were made in England show us here The mettle of your pasture let us swear That you are worth your breeding which I doubt not For there is none of you so mean and base That hath not noble lustre in your eyes I see you stand like greyhounds in the slips Straining upon the start The game's afoot Follow your spirit and upon this charge Cry 'God for Harry England and Saint George' Alarum and chambers go offBefore Harfleur and On on on on on to the breach to the breachPray thee Corporal stay the knocks are too hot and for mine own part I have not a case of lives The humour of it is too hot that is the very plainsong of itThe plainsong is most just for humours do abound Knocks go and come God's vassals drop and die And sword and shield In bloody fieldDoth win immortal fameWould I were in an alehouse in London I wouid give all my fame for a pot of ale and safetyAnd IIf wishes would prevail with meMy purpose should not fail with meBut thither would I hieAs duly but not as trulyAs bird doth sing on bough Up to the breach you dogs Avaunt you cullions Driving them forwardBe merciful great duke to men of mould Abate thy rage abate thy manly rage Abate thy rage great duke Good bawcock bate thy rage Use lenity sweet chuckThese be good humours Your honour wins bad humoursall but As young as I am I have observ'd these three swashers I am boy to them all three but all they three though they would serve me could not be man to me for indeed three such antics do not amount to a man For Bardolph he is whiteliver'd and redfac'd by the means whereof 'a faces it out but fights not For Pistol he hath a killing tongue and a quiet sword by the means whereof 'a breaks words and keeps whole weapons For Nym he hath heard that men of few words are the best men and therefore he scorns to say his prayers lest 'a should be thought a coward but his few bad words are match'd with as few good deeds for 'a never broke any man's head but his own and that was against a post when he was drunk They will steal anything and call it purchase Bardolph stole a lutecase bore it twelve leagues and sold it for three halfpence Nym and Bardolph are sworn brothers in filching and in Calais they stole a fireshovel I knew by that piece of service the men would carry coals They would have me as familiar with men's pockets as their gloves or their handkerchers which makes much against my manhood if I should take from another's pocket to put into mine for it is plain pocketing up of wrongs I must leave them and seek some better service their villainy goes against my weak stomach and therefore I must cast it up RefollowingCaptain Fluellen you must come presently to the mines the Duke of Gloucester would speak with youTo the mines Tell you the Duke it is not so good to come to the mines for look you the mines is not according to the disciplines of the war the concavities of it is not sufficient For look you th' athversary you may discuss unto the Duke look you is digt himself four yard under the countermines by Cheshu I think 'a will plow up all if there is not better directionsThe Duke of Gloucester to whom the order of the siege is given is altogether directed by an Irishman a very vallant gentleman i' faithIt is Captain Macmorris is it notI think it beBy Cheshu he is an ass as in the world I will verify as much in his beard he has no more directions in the true disciplines of the wars look you of the Roman disciplines than is a puppydog and Here 'a comes and the Scots captain Captain Jamy with himCaptain Jamy is a marvellous falorous gentleman that is certain and of great expedition and knowledge in th' aunchient wars upon my particular knowledge of his directions By Cheshu he will maintain his argument as well as any military man in the world in the disciplines of the pristine wars of the RomansI say gud day Captain FluellenGodden to your worship good Captain JamesHow now Captain Macmorris Have you quit the mines Have the pioneers given o'erBy Chrish la tish ill done The work ish give over the trompet sound the

gud gud feith gud captains bath and I sall quit you with gud leve as I may pick occasion that sall I marryIt is no time to discourse so Chrish save me The day is hot and the weather and the wars and the King and the Dukes it is no time to discourse The town is beseech'd and the trumpet call us to the breach and we talk and be Chrish do nothing 'Tis shame for us all so God sa' me 'tis shame to stand still it is shame by my hand and there is throats to be cut and works to be done and there ish nothing done so Chrish sa' me laBy the mess ere theise eyes of mine take themselves to slomber ay'll de gud service or I'll lig i' th' grund for it ay or go to death And I'll pay't as valorously as I may that sall I suerly do that is the breff and the long Marry I wad full fain heard some question 'tween you twayCaptain Macmorris I think look you under your correction there is not many of your nationOf my nation What ish my nation Ish a villain and a bastard and a knave and a rascal What ish my nation Who talks of my nationLook you if you take the matter otherwise than is meant Captain Macmorris peradventure I shall think you do not use me with that affability as in discretion you ought to use me look you being as good a man as yourself both in the disciplines of war and in the derivation of my birth and in other particularitiesI do not know you so good a man as myself so Chrish save me I will cut off your headGentlemen both you will mistake each otherAh that's a foul faultA parley soundedThe town sounds a parleyCaptain Macmorris when there is more better opportunity to be required look you I will be so bold as to tell you I know the disciplines of war and there is an endBefore the gates of Harfleurthe and some citizens on the walls theand all his train before the gatesHow yet resolves the Governor of the town This is the latest parle we will admit Therefore to our best mercy give yourselves Or like to men proud of destruction Defy us to our worst for as I am a soldier A name that in my thoughts becomes me best If I begin the batt'ry once again I will not leave the halfachieved Harfleur Till in her ashes she lie buried The gates of mercy shall be all shut up And the flesh'd soldier rough and hard of heart In liberty of bloody hand shall range With conscience wide as hell mowing like grass Your fresh fair virgins and your flow'ring infants What is it then to me if impious war Array'd in flames like to the prince of fiends Do with his smirch'd complexion all fell feats Enlink'd to waste and desolation What is't to me when you yourselves are cause If your pure maidens fall into the hand Of hot and forcing violation What rein can hold licentious wickednes When down the hill he holds his fierce career We may as bootless spend our vain command Upon th' enraged soldiers in their spoil As send precepts to the Leviathan To come ashore Therefore you men of Harfleur Take pity of your town and of your people Whiles yet my soldiers are in my command Whiles yet the cool and temperate wind of grace O'erblows the filthy and contagious clouds Of heady murder spoil and villainy If not why in a moment look to see The blind and bloody with foul hand Defile the locks of your shrillshrieking daughters Your fathers taken by the silver beards And their most reverend heads dash'd to the walls Your naked infants spitted upon pikes Whiles the mad mothers with their howls confus'd Do break the clouds as did the wives of Jewry At Herod's bloodyhunting slaughtermen What say you Will you yield and this avoid Or guilty in defence be thus destroy'dOur expectation hath this day an end The Dauphin whom of succours we entreated Returns us that his powers are yet not ready To raise so great a siege Therefore great King We yield our town and lives to thy soft mercyour gates dispose of us and ours For we no longer are defensibleOpen your gates Come uncle Exeter Go you andHarfleur there remain And fortify it strongly 'gainst the French

England that we send To know what willing ransom he will give Prince Dauphin you shall stay with us in RouenNot so I do beseech your MajestyBe patient for you shall remain with us Now forth Lord Constable and Princes all And quickly bring us word of England's fallThe English camp in Picardy English and Welsh and How now Captain Fluellen Come you from the bridgeI assure you there is very excellent services committed at the bridgeIs the Duke of Exeter safeThe Duke of Exeter is as magnanimous as Agamemnon and a man that I love and honour with my soul and my heart and my duty and my live and my living and my uttermost power He is not God be praised and blessed any hurt in the world but keeps the bridge most valiantly with excellent discipline There is an aunchient Lieutenant there at the bridge I think in my very conscience he is as valiant a man as Mark Antony and he is man of no estimation in the world but I did see him do as gallant serviceWhat do you call himHe is call'd Aunchient PistolI know him notHere is the manCaptain I thee beseech to do me favours The Duke of Exeter doth love thee wellAy I praise God and I have merited some love at his handsBardolph a soldier firm and sound of heart And of buxom valour hath by cruel fate And giddy Fortune's furious fickle wheel That goddess blind That stands upon the rolling restless stoneBy your patience Aunchient Pistol Fortune is painted blind with a muffler afore her eyes to signify to you that Fortune is blind and she is painted also with a wheel to signify to you which is the moral of it that she is turning and inconstant and mutability and variation and her foot look you is fixed upon a spherical stone which rolls and rolls and rolls In good truth the poet makes a most excellent description of it Fortune is an excellent moralFortune is Bardolph's foe and frowns on him For he hath stol'n a pax and hanged must 'a be A damned death Let gallows gape for dog let man go free And let not hemp his windpipe suffocate But Exeter hath given the doom of death For pax of little price Therefore go speak the Duke will hear thy voice And let not Bardolph's vital thread be cut With edge of penny cord and vile reproach Speak Captain for his life and I will thee requiteAunchient Pistol I do partly understand your meaningWhy then rejoice thereforeCertainly Aunchient it is not a thing to rejoice at for if look you he were my brother I would desire the Duke to use his good pleasure and put him to execution for discipline ought to be usedDie and be damn'd and figo for thy friendshipIt is wellThe fig of Spain Very goodWhy this is an arrant counterfeit rascal I remember him now a bawd a cutpurseI'll assure you 'a utt'red as prave words at the pridge as you shall see in a summer's day But it is very well what he has spoke to me that is well I warrant you when time is serveWhy 'tis a gull a fool a rogue that now and then goes to the wars to grace himself at his return into London under the form of a soldier And such fellows are perfect in the great commanders' names and they will learn you by rote where services were done at such and such a sconce at such a breach at such a convoy who came off bravely who was shot who disgrac'd what terms the enemy stood on and this they con perfectly in the phrase of war which they trick up with newtuned oaths and what a beard of the General's cut and a horrid suit of the camp will do among foaming bottles and alewash'd wits is wonderful to be thought on But you must learn to know such slanders of the age or else you may be marvellously mistookI tell you what Captain Gower I do perceive he is not the man that he would gladly make show to the world he is if I find a hole in his coat I will tell him my mind Drum within Hark you the King is coming and I must speak with him from the pridgeDrum and coloursthe and his poor soldiers andGod pless your MajestyHow now Fluellen Cam'st thou from the bridgeAy so please your Majesty The Duke of Exeter has very gallantly maintain'd the pridge the French is gone off look you and there is gallant and most prave passages Marry th' athversary was have possession of the pridge but he is enforced to retire and the Duke of Exeter is master of the pridge I can tell your Majesty the Duke is a prave manWhat men have you lost FluellenThe perdition of th' athversary hath been very great reasonable great marry for my part I think the Duke hath lost never a man but one that is like to be executed for robbing a church one Bardolph if your Majesty know the man his face is all bubukles and whelks and knobs and flames o' fire and his lips blows at his nose and it is like a coal of fire sometimes plue and sometimes red but his nose is executed and his fire's outWe would have all such offenders so cut off And we give express charge that in our marches through the country there be nothing compell'd from the villages nothing taken but paid for none of the French upbraided or abused in disdainful language for when lenity and cruelty play for a kingdom the gentler gamester is the soonest winner TucketYou know me by my habitWell then I know thee what shall I know of theeMy master's mindUnfold itThus says my king Say thou to Harry of England Though we seem'd dead we did but sleep advantage is a better soldier than rashness Tell him we could have rebuk'd him at Harfleur but that we thought not good to bruise an injury till it were full ripe Now we speak upon our cue and our voice is imperial England shall repent his folly see his weakness and admire our sufferance Bid him therefore consider of his ransom which must proportion the losses we have borne the subjects we have lost the disgrace we have digested which in weight to reanswer his pettiness would bow under For our losses his exchequer is too poor for th' effusion of our blood the muster of his kingdom too faint a number and for our disgrace his own person kneeling at our feet but a weak and worthless satisfaction To this add defiance and tell him for conclusion he hath betrayed his followers whose condemnation is pronounc'd So far my king and master so much my officeWhat is thy name I know thy qualityMontjoyThou dost thy office fairly Turn thee back And tell thy king I do not seek him now But could be willing to march on to Calais Without impeachment for to say the sooth Though 'tis no wisdom to confess so much Unto an enemy of craft and vantage My people are with sickness much enfeebled My numbers lessen'd and those few I have Almost no better than so many French Who when they were in health I tell thee herald I thought upon one pair of English legs Did march three Frenchmen Yet forgive me God That I do brag thus this your air of France Hath blown that vice in me I must repent Go therefore tell thy master here I am My ransom is this frail and worthless trunk My army but a weak and sickly guard Yet God before tell him we will come on Though France himself and such another neighbour Stand in our way There's for thy labour Montjoy Go bid thy master well advise himself If we may pass we will if we be hind'red We shall your tawny ground with your red blood Discolour and so Montjoy fare you well The sum of all our answer is but this We would not seek a battle as we are Nor as we are we say we will not shun it So tell your masterI shall deliver so Thanks to your Highness I hope they will not come upon us nowWe are in God's hand brother not in theirs March to the bridge it now draws toward night Beyond the river we'll encamp ourselves And on tomorrow bid them march away The French camp near Agincourtthe thethe thewith othersTut I have the best armour of the world Would it were dayYou have an excellent armour but let my horse have his dueIt is the best horse of EuropeWill it never be morningMy Lord of Orleans and my Lord High Constable you talk of horse and armourYou are as well provided of both as any prince in the worldWhat a long night is this I will not change my horse with any that treads but on four pasterns Ca ha he bounds from the earth as if his entrails were hairs le cheval volant the Pegasus chez les narines de feu When I bestride him I soar I am a hawk He trots the air the earth sings when he touches it the basest horn of his hoof is more musical than the pipe of HermesHe's of the colour of the nutmegAnd of the heat of the ginger It is a beast for Perseus he is pure air and fire and the dull elements of earth and water never appear in him but only in patient stillness while his rider mounts him he is indeed a horse and all other jades you may call beastsIndeed my lord it is a most absolute and excellent horseIt is the prince of palfreys his neigh is like the bidding of a monarch and his countenance enforces homageNo more cousinNay the man hath no wit that cannot from the rising of the lark to the lodging of the lamb vary deserved praise on my palfrey It is a theme as fluent as the sea turn the sands into eloquent tongues and my horse is argument for them all 'tis a subject for a sovereign to reason on and for a sovereign's sovereign to ride on and for the world familiar to us and unknown to lay apart their particular functions and wonder at him I once writ a sonnet in his praise and began thus 'Wonder of nature'I have heard a sonnet begin so to one's mistressThen did they imitate that which I compos'd to my courser for my horse is my mistressYour mistress bears wellMe well which is the prescript praise and perfection of a good and particular mistressNay for methought yesterday your mistress shrewdly shook your backSo perhaps did yoursMine was not bridledO then belike she was old and gentle and you rode like a kern of Ireland your French hose off and in your strait strossersYou have good judgment in horsemanshipBe warn'd by me then they that ride so and ride not warily fall into foul bogs I had rather have my horse to my mistressI had as lief have my mistress a jadeI tell thee Constable my mistress wears his own hairI could make as true a boast as that if I had a sow to my mistress'Le chien est retourne a son propre vomissement et la truie lavee au bourbier' Thou mak'st use of anythingYet do I not use my horse for my mistress or any such proverb so little kin to the purposeMy Lord Constable the armour that I saw in your tent tonight are those stars or suns upon itStars my lordSome of them will fall tomorrow I hopeAnd yet my sky shall not wantThat may be for you bear a many superfluously and 'twere more honour some were awayEv'n as your horse bears your praises who would trot as well were some of your brags dismountedWould I were able to load him with his desert Will it never be day I will trot tomorrow a mile and my way shall be paved with English facesI will not say so for fear I should be fac'd out of my way but I would it were morning for I would fain be about the ears of the EnglishWho will go to hazard with me for twenty prisonersYou must first go yourself to hazard ere you have them'Tis midnight I'll go arm myself The Dauphin longs for morningHe longs to eat the EnglishI think he will eat all he killsBy the white hand of my lady he's a gallant princeSwear by her foot that she may tread out the oathHe is simply the most active gentleman of FranceDoing is activity and he will still be doingHe never did harm that I heard ofNor will do none tomorrow he will keep that good name stillI know him to be valiantI was told that by one that knows him better than youWhat's heMarry he told me so himself and he said he car'd not who knew itHe needs not it is no hidden virtue in himBy my faith sir but it is never anybody saw it but his lackey 'Tis a hooded valour and when it appears it will bateIllwind never said wellI will cap that proverb with 'There is flattery in friendship'And I will take up that with 'Give the devil his due'Well plac'd There stands your friend for the devil have at the very eye of that proverb with 'A pox of the devil'You are the better at proverbs by how much 'A fool's bolt is soon shot'You have shot over'Tis not the first time you were overshota My Lord High Constable the English lie within fifteen hundred paces of your tentsWho hath measur'd the groundThe Lord GrandpreA valiant and most expert gentleman Would it were day Alas poor Harry of England he longs not for the dawning as we doWhat a wretched and peevish fellow is this King of England to mope with his fatbrain'd followers so far out of his knowledgeIf the English had any apprehension they would run awayThat they lack for if their heads had any intellectual armour they could never wear such heavy headpiecesThat island of England breeds very valiant creatures their mastiffs are of unmatchable courageFoolish curs that run winking into the mouth of a Russian bear and have their heads crush'd like rotten apples You may as well say that's a valiant flea that dare eat his breakfast on the lip of a lionJust just and the men do sympathise with the mastiffs in robustious and rough coming on leaving their wits with their wives and then give them great meals of beef and iron and steel they will eat like wolves and fight like devilsAy but these English are shrewdly out of beefThen shall we find tomorrow they have only stomachs to eat and none to fight Now is it time to arm Come shall we about itIt is now two o'clock but let me see by ten We shall have each a hundred Englishmen
