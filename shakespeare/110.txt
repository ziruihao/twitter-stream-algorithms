part We are wise girls to mock our lovers soThey are worse fools to purchase mocking so That same Berowne I'll torture ere I go O that I knew he were but in by th' week How I would make him fawn and

pertauntlike would I o'ersway his state That he should be my fool and I his fate None are so surely caught when they are catch'd As wit turn'd fool folly in wisdom hatch'd Hath wisdom's warrant and the help of school And wit's own grace to grace a learned foolThe blood of youth burns not with such excess As gravity's revolt to wantonnessFolly in fools bears not so strong a note As fool'ry in the wise when wit doth dote Since all the power thereof it doth apply To prove by wit worth in simplicity Here comes Boyet and mirth is in his faceO I am stabb'd with laughter Where's her Grace Thy news BoyetPrepare madam prepare Arm wenches arm Encounters mounted are Against your peace Love doth approach disguis'd Armed in arguments you'll be surpris'd Muster your wits stand in your own defence Or hide your heads like cowards and fly hence Saint Dennis to Saint Cupid What are they That charge their breath against us Say scout sayUnder the cool shade of a sycamore I thought to close mine eyes some half an hour When lo to interrupt my purpos'd rest Toward that shade I might behold addrest The King and his companions warily I stole into a neighbour thicket by And overheard what you shall overhear That by and by disguis'd they will be here Their herald is a pretty knavish page That well by heart hath conn'd his embassage Action and accent did they teach him there 'Thus must thou speak' and 'thus thy body bear' And ever and anon they made a doubt Presence majestical would put him out 'For' quoth the King 'an angel shalt thou see Yet fear not thou but speak audaciously' The boy replied 'An angel is not evil I should have fear'd her had she been a devil' With that all laugh'd and clapp'd him on the shoulder Making the bold wag by their praises bolder One rubb'd his elbow thus and fleer'd and swore A better speech was never spoke before Another with his finger and his thumb Cried 'Via we will do't come what will come' The third he caper'd and cried 'All goes well' The fourth turn'd on the toe and down he fell With that they all did tumble on the ground With such a zealous laughter so profound That in this spleen ridiculous appears To check their folly passion's solemn tears But what but what come they to visit usThey do they do and are apparell'd thus Like Muscovites or Russians as I guess Their purpose is to parley court and dance And every one his lovefeat will advance Unto his several mistress which they'll know By favours several which they did bestow And will they so The gallants shall be task'd For ladies we will every one be mask'd And not a man of them shall have the grace Despite of suit to see a lady's face Hold Rosaline this favour thou shalt wear And then the King will court thee for his dear Hold take thou this my sweet and give me thine So shall Berowne take me for Rosaline And change you favours too so shall your loves Woo contrary deceiv'd by these removesCome on then wear the favours most in sightBut in this changing what is your intent The effect of my intent is to cross theirs They do it but in mocking merriment And mock for mock is only my intent Their several counsels they unbosom shall To loves mistook and so be mock'd withal Upon the next occasion that we meet With visages display'd to talk and greetBut shall we dance if they desire us to't No to the death we will not move a foot Nor to their penn'd speech render we no grace But while 'tis spoke each turn away her faceWhy that contempt will kill the speaker's heart And quite divorce his memory from his part Therefore I do it and I make no doubt The rest will ne'er come in if he be out There's no such sport as sport by sport o'erthrown To make theirs ours and ours none but our own So shall we stay mocking intended game And they well mock'd depart away with shameTrumpet sounds withinThe trumpet sounds be mask'd the maskers comeThe maskmusic as Prologue theand his as maskers in the guise of RussiansAll hail the richest heauties on the earthBeauties no

gentleness Was guilty of it Farewell worthy lord A heavy heart bears not a nimble tongue Excuse me so coming too short of thanks For my great suit so easily obtain'dThe extreme parts of time extremely forms All causes to the purpose of his speed And often at his very loose decides That which long process could not arbitrate And though the mourning brow of progeny Forbid the smiling courtesy of love The holy suit which fain it would convince Yet since love's argument was first on foot Let not the cloud of sorrow justle it From what it purpos'd since to wail friends lost Is not by much so wholesomeprofitable As to rejoice at friends but newly found I understand you not my griefs are doubleHonest plain words best pierce the ear of grief And by these badges understand the King For your fair sakes have we neglected time Play'd foul play with our oaths your beauty ladies Hath much deformed us fashioning our humours Even to the opposed end of our intents And what in us hath seem'd ridiculous As love is full of unbefitting strains All wanton as a child skipping and vain Form'd by the eye and therefore like the eye Full of strange shapes of habits and of forms Varying in subjects as the eye doth roll To every varied object in his glance Which particoated presence of loose love Put on by us if in your heavenly eyes Have misbecom'd our oaths and gravities Those heavenly eyes that look into these faults Suggested us to make Therefore ladies Our love being yours the error that love makes Is likewise yours We to ourselves prove false By being once false for ever to be true To those that make us both fair ladies you And even that falsehood in itself a sin Thus purifies itself and turns to grace We have receiv'd your letters full of love Your favours the ambassadors of love And in our maiden council rated them At courtship pleasant jest and courtesy As bombast and as lining to the time But more devout than this in our respects Have we not been and therefore met your loves In their own fashion like a merrimentOur letters madam show'd much more than jestSo did our looksWe did not quote them soNow at the latest minute of the hour Grant us your loves A time methinks too short To make a worldwithoutend bargain in No no my lord your Grace is perjur'd much Full of dear guiltiness and therefore this If for my love as there is no such cause You will do aught this shall you do for me Your oath I will not trust but go with speed To some forlorn and naked hermitage Remote from all the pleasures of the world There stay until the twelve celestial signs Have brought about the annual reckoning If this austere insociable life Change not your offer made in heat of blood If frosts and fasts hard lodging and thin weeds Nip not the gaudy blossoms of your love But that it bear this trial and last love Then at the expiration of the year Come challenge me challenge me by these deserts And by this virgin palm now kissing thine I will be thine and till that instant shut My woeful self up in a mournful house Raining the tears of lamentation For the remembrance of my father's death If this thou do deny let our hands part Neither intitled in the other's heartIf this or more than this I would deny To flatter up these powers of mine with rest The sudden hand of death close up mine eye Hence hermit then my heart is in thy breastAnd what to me my love and what to meYou must he purged too your sins are rack'd You are attaint with faults and perjury Therefore if you my favour mean to get A twelvemonth shall you spend and never rest But seek the weary beds of people sickBut what to me my love but what to me A wifeA beard fair health and honesty With threefold love I wish you all these threeO shall I say I thank you gentle wifeNo so my lord a twelvemonth and a day I'll mark no words that smoothfac'd wooers say Come when the King doth to my lady come Then if I have much love I'll give you someI'll serve thee true and faithfully till thenYet swear not lest ye be forsworn againWhat says MariaAt the twelvemonth's end I'll change my black gown for a faithful friendI'll stay with patience but the time is longThe liker you few taller are so youngStudies my lady Mistress look on me Behold the window of my heart mine eye What humble suit attends thy answer there Impose some service on me for thy loveOft have I heard of you my Lord Berowne Before I saw you and the world's large tongue Proclaims you for a man replete with mocks Full of comparisons and wounding flouts Which you on all estates will execute That lie within the mercy of your wit To weed this wormwood from your fruitful brain And therewithal to win me if you please Without the which I am not to be won You shall this twelvemonth term from day to day Visit the speechless sick and still converse With groaning wretches and your task shall be With all the fierce endeavour of your wit To enforce the pained impotent to smileTo move wild laughter in the throat of death It cannot be it is impossible Mirth cannot move a soul in agonyWhy that's the way to choke a gibing spirit Whose influence is begot of that loose grace Which shallow laughing hearers give to fools A jest's prosperity lies in the ear Of him that hears it never in the tongue Of him that makes it then if sickly ears Deaf'd with the clamours of their own dear groans Will hear your idle scorns continue then And I will have you and that fault withal But if they will not throw away that spirit And I shall find you empty of that fault Right joyful of your reformationA twelvemonth Well befall what will befall I'll jest a twelvemonth in an hospitalTo the King Ay sweet my lord and so I take my leaveNo madam we will bring you on your wayOur wooing doth not end like an old play Jack hath not Jill These ladies' courtesy Might well have made our sport a comedyCome sir it wants a twelvemonth an' a day And then 'twill endThat's too long for a play Re Sweet Majesty vouchsafe me Was not that not HectorThe worthy knight of TroyI will kiss thy royal finger and take leave I am a votary I have vow'd to Jaquenetta to hold the plough for her sweet love three year But most esteemed greatness will you hear the dialogue that the two learned men have compiled in praise of the Owl and the Cuckoo It should have followed in the end of our showCall them forth quickly we will do soHolla approachAll This side is Hiems Winter this Ver the Spring the one maintained by the Owl th' other by the Cuckoo Ver begin When daisies pied and violets blueAnd ladysmocks all silverwhiteAnd cuckoobuds of yellow hueDo paint the meadows with delightThe cuckoo then on every treeMocks married men for thus sings he 'CuckooCuckoo cuckoo' O word of fearUnpleasing to a married earWhen shepherds pipe on oaten strawsAnd merry larks are ploughmen's clocksWhen turtles tread and rooks and dawsAnd maidens bleach their summer smocksThe cuckoo then on every treeMocks married men for thus sings he 'CuckooCuckoo cuckoo' O word of fearUnpleasing to a married ear When icicles hang by the wallAnd Dick the shepherd blows his nailAnd Tom bears logs into the hallAnd milk comes frozen home in pailWhen blood is nipp'd and ways be foulThen nightly sings the staring owl 'TuwhoTuwhit Tuwho' A merry noteWhile greasy Joan doth keel the potWhen all aloud the wind doth blowAnd coughing drowns the parson's sawAnd birds sit brooding in the snowAnd Marian's nose looks red and rawWhen roasted crabs hiss in the bowlThen nightly sings the staring owl 'TuwhoTuwhit Towho' A merry noteWhile greasy Joan doth keel the potThe words of Mercury are harsh after the songs of Apollo You that way we this way
