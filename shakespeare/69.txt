England pillars of the state To you Duke Humphrey must unload his grief Your grief the common grief of all the land What did my brother Henry spend his youth His valour coin and people in the wars Did he so often lodge in open field In winter's cold and summer's parching heat To conquer France his true inheritance And did my brother Bedford toil his wits To keep by policy what Henry got Have you yourselves Somerset Buckingham Brave York Salisbury and victorious Warwick Receiv'd deep scars in France and Normandy Or hath mine uncle Beaufort and myself With all the learned Council of the realm Studied so long sat in the Council House Early and late debating to and fro How France and Frenchmen might be kept in awe And had his Highness in his infancy Crowned in Paris in despite of foes And shall these labours and these honours die Shall Henry's conquest Bedford's vigilance Your deeds of war and all our counsel die O peers of England shameful is this league Fatal this marriage cancelling your fame Blotting your names from books of memory Razing the characters of your renown Defacing monuments of conquer'd France Undoing all as all had never beenNephew what means this passionate discourse This peroration with such circumstance For France 'tis ours and we will keep it stillAy uncle we will keep it if we can But now it is impossible we should Suffolk the newmade duke that rules the roast Hath given the duchy of Anjou and Maine Unto the poor King Reignier whose large style Agrees not with the leanness of his purseNow by the death of Him that died for all These counties were the keys of Normandy But wherefore weeps Warwick my valiant sonFor grief that they are past recovery For were there hope to conquer them again My sword should shed hot blood mine eyes no tears Anjou and Maine myself did win them both Those provinces these arms of mine did conquer And are the cities that I got with wounds Deliver'd up again with peaceful words Mort DieuFor Suffolk's duke may he be suffocate That dims the honour of this warlike isle France should have torn and rent my very heart Before I would have yielded to this league I never read but England's kings have had Large sums of gold and dowries with their wives And our King Henry gives away his own To match with her that brings no vantagesA proper jest and never heard before That Suffolk should demand a whole fifteenth For costs and charges in transporting her She should have stay'd in France and starv'd in France BeforeMy Lord of Gloucester now ye grow too hot It was the pleasure of my lord the KingMy Lord of Winchester I know your mind 'Tis not my speeches that you do mislike But 'tis my presence that doth trouble ye Rancour will out proud prelate in thy face I see thy fury if I longer stay We shall begin our ancient bickerings Lordings farewell and say when I am gone I prophesied France will be lost ere longSo there goes our Protector in a rage 'Tis known to you he is mine enemy Nay more an enemy unto you all And no great friend I fear me to the King Consider lords he is the next of blood And heir apparent to the English crown Had Henry got an empire by his marriage And all the wealthy kingdoms of the west There's reason he should be displeas'd at it Look to it lords let not his smoothing words Bewitch your hearts be wise and circumspect What though the common people favour him Calling him 'Humphrey the good Duke of Gloucester' Clapping their hands and crying with loud voice 'Jesu maintain your royal excellence' With 'God preserve the good Duke Humphrey' I fear me lords for all this flattering gloss He will be found a dangerous ProtectorWhy should he then protect our sovereign He being of age to govern of himself Cousin of Somerset join you with me And all together with the Duke of Suffolk We'll quickly hoise Duke Humphrey from his seatThis weighty business will not brook delay I'll to the Duke of Suffolk presentlyCousin of Buckingham though Humphrey's pride And greatness of his place be grief to us Yet let us watch the haughty cardinal His insolence is more intolerable Than all the princes in the land beside If Gloucester be displac'd he'll be ProtectorOr thou or I Somerset will be Protector Despite Duke Humphrey or the CardinalPride went before ambition follows him While these do labour for their own preferment Behoves it us to labour for the realm I never saw but Humphrey Duke of Gloucester Did bear him like a noble gentleman Oft have I seen the haughty Cardinal More like a soldier than a man o' th' church As stout and proud as he were lord of all Swear like a ruffian and demean himself Unlike the ruler of a commonweal Warwick my son the comfort of my age Thy deeds thy plainness and thy housekeeping Hath won the greatest favour of the commons Excepting none but good Duke Humphrey And brother York thy acts in Ireland In bringing them to civil discipline Thy late exploits done in the heart of France When thou wert Regent for our sovereign Have made thee fear'd and honour'd of the people Join we together for the public good In what we can to bridle and suppress The pride of Suffolk and the Cardinal With Somerset's and Buckingham's ambition And as we may cherish Duke Humphrey's deeds While they do tend the profit of the landSo God help Warwick as he loves the land And common profit of his countryAnd so says York Aside for he hath greatest causeThen let's make haste away and look unto the mainUnto the main O father Maine is lost That Maine which by main force Warwick did win And would have kept so long as breath did last Main chance father you meant but I meant Maine Which I will win from France or else be slainAnjou and Maine are given to the French Paris is lost the state of Normandy Stands on a tickle point now they are gone Suffolk concluded on the articles The peers agreed and Henry was well pleas'd To changes two dukedoms for a duke's fair daughter I cannot blame them all what is't to them 'Tis thine they give away and not their own Pirates may make cheap pennyworths of their pillage And purchase friends and give to courtezans Still revelling like lords till all be gone While as the silly owner of the goods Weeps over them and wrings his hapless hands And shakes his head and trembling stands aloof While all is shar'd and all is borne away Ready to starve and dare not touch his own So York must sit and fret and bite his tongue While his own lands are bargain'd for and sold Methinks the realms of England France and Ireland Bear that proportion to my flesh and blood As did the fatal brand Althaea burnt Unto the prince's heart of Calydon Anjou and Maine both given unto the French Cold news for me for I had hope of France Even as I have of fertile England's soil A day will come when York shall claim his own And therefore I will take the Nevils' parts And make a show of love to proud Duke Humphrey And when I spy advantage claim the crown For that's the golden mark I seek to hit Nor shall proud Lancaster usurp my right Nor hold the sceptre in his childish fist Nor wear the diadem upon his head Whose churchlike humours fits not for a crown Then York be still awhile till time do serve Watch thou and wake when others be asleep To pry into the secrets of the state Till Henry surfeiting in joys of love With his new bride and England's dearbought queen And Humphrey with the peers be fall'n at jars Then will I raise aloft the milkwhite rose With whose sweet smell the air shall be perfum'd And in my standard bear the arms of York To grapple with the house of Lancaster And force perforce I'll make him yield the crown Whose bookish rule hath pull'd fair England down The houseand his wife Why droops my lord like overripen'd corn Hanging the head at Ceres' plenteous load Why doth the great Duke Humphrey knit his brows As frowning at the favours of the world Why are thine eyes fix'd to the sullen earth Gazing on that which seems to dim thy sight What see'st thou there King Henry's diadem Enchas'd with all the honours of the world If so gaze on and grovel on thy face Until thy head be circled with the same Put forth thy hand reach at the glorious gold What is't too short I'll lengthen it with mine And having both together heav'd it up We'll both together lift our heads to heaven And never more abase our sight so low As to vouchsafe one glance unto the groundO Nell sweet Nell if thou dost love thy lord Banish the canker of ambitious thoughts And may that thought when I imagine ill Against my king and nephew virtuous Henry Be my last breathing in this mortal world My troublous dreams this night doth make me sadWhat dream'd my lord Tell me and I'll requite it With sweet rehearsal of my morning's dreamMethought this staff mine officebadge in court Was broke in twain by whom I have forgot But as I think it was by th' Cardinal And on the pieces of the broken wand Were plac'd the heads of Edmund Duke of Somerset And William de la Pole first Duke of Suffolk This was my dream what it doth bode God knowsTut this was nothing but an argument That he that breaks a stick of Gloucester's grove Shall lose his head for his presumption But list to me my Humphrey my sweet Duke Methought I sat in seat of majesty In the cathedral church of Westminster And in that chair where kings and queens were crown'd Where Henry and Dame Margaret kneel'd to me And on my head did set the diademNay Eleanor then must I chide outright Presumptuous dame illnurtur'd Eleanor Art thou not second woman in the realm And the Protector's wife belov'd of him Hast thou not worldly pleasure at command Above the reach or compass of thy thought And wilt thou still be hammering treachery To tumble down thy husband and thyself From top of honour to disgrace's feet Away from me and let me hear no moreWhat what my lord Are you so choleric With Eleanor for telling but her dream Next time I'll keep my dreams unto myself And not be check'dNay be not angry I am pleas'd again a My Lord Protector 'tis his Highness' pleasure You do prepare to ride unto Saint Albans Where as the King and Queen do mean to hawkI go Come Nell thou wilt ride with usYes my good lord I'll follow presentlyFollow I must I cannot go before While Gloucester bears this base and humble mind Were I a man a duke and next of blood I would remove these tedious stumblingblocks And smooth my way upon

full Here Hume take this reward make merry man With thy confederates in this weighty causeHume must make merry with the Duchess' gold Marry and shall But how now Sir John Hume Seal up your lips and give no words but mum The business asketh silent secrecy Dame Eleanor gives gold to bring the witch Gold cannot come amiss were she a devil Yet have I gold flies from another coast I dare not say from the rich Cardinal And from the great and newmade Duke of Suffolk Yet I do find it so for to be plain They knowing Dame Eleanor's aspiring humour Have hired me to undermine the Duchess And buzz these conjurations in her brain They say 'A crafty knave does need no broker' Yet am I Suffolk and the Cardinal's broker Hume if you take not heed you shall go near To call them both a pair of crafty knaves

queen in title and in style And must be made a subject to a duke I tell thee Pole when in the city Tours Thou ran'st a tilt in honour of my love And stol'st away the ladies' hearts of France I thought King Henry had resembled thee In courage courtship and proportion But all his mind is bent to holiness To number AveMaries on his beads His champions are the prophets and apostles His weapons holy saws of sacred writ His study is his tiltyard and his loves Are brazen images of canonized saints I would the college of the Cardinals Would choose him Pope and carry him to Rome And set the triple

more in England than the Nevils Salisbury and Warwick are no simple peersNot all these lords do vex me half so much As that proud dame the Lord Protector's wife She sweeps it through the court with troops of ladies More like an empress than Duke Humphrey's wife Strangers in court do take her for the Queen She bears a duke's revenues on her back And in her heart she scorns our poverty Shall I not

Suffolk gave two dukedoms for his daughterMadam myself have lim'd a bush for her And plac'd a quire of such enticing birds That she will light to listen to the lays And never mount to trouble you again So let her rest And madam list to me For I am bold to counsel you in this Although we fancy not the Cardinal Yet must we join with him and with the lords Till we have brought Duke Humphrey in

at his pleasure will resign my placeResign it then and leave thine insolence Since thou wert king as who is king but thou The commonwealth hath daily run to wrack The Dauphin hath prevail'd beyond the
