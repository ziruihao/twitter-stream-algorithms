The Abbey at Bury St Edmunds Sound a sennetthethe andto the ParliamentI muse my Lord of Gloucester is not come 'Tis not his wont to be the hindmost man Whate'er occasion keeps him from us nowCan you not see or will ye not observe The strangeness of his alter'd countenance With what a majesty he bears himself How insolent of late he is become How proud how peremptory and unlike himself We know the time since he was mild and affable And if we did but glance a faroff look Immediately he was upon his knee That all the court admir'd him for submission But meet him now and be it in the morn When every one will give the time of day He knits his brow and shows an angry eye And passeth by with stiff unbowed knee Disdaining duty that to us belongs Small curs are not regarded when they grin But great men tremble when the lion roars And Humphrey is no little man in England First note that he is near you in descent And should you fall he is the next will mount Me seemeth then it is no policy Respecting what a rancorous mind he bears And his advantage following your decease That he should come about your royal person Or be admitted to your Highness' Council By flattery hath he won the commons' hearts And when he please to make commotion 'Tis to be fear'd they all will follow him Now 'tis the spring and weeds are shallowrooted Suffer them now and they'll o'ergrow the garden And choke the herbs for want of husbandry The reverent care I bear unto my lord Made me collect these dangers in the Duke If it be fond can it a woman's fear Which fear if better reasons can supplant I will subscribe and say I wrong'd the Duke My Lord of Suffolk Buckingham and York Reprove my allegation if you can Or else conclude my words effectualWell hath your Highness seen into this duke And had I first been put to speak my mind I think I should have told your Grace's tale The Duchess by his subornation Upon my life began her devilish practices Or if he were not privy to those faults Yet by reputing of his high descent As next the King he was successive heir And such high vaunts of his nobility Did instigate the bedlam brainsick Duchess By wicked means to frame our sovereign's fall Smooth runs the water where the brook is deep And in his simple show he harbours treason The fox barks not when he would steal the lamb No no my sovereign Gloucester is a man Unsounded yet and full of deep deceitDid he not contrary to form of law Devise strange deaths for small offences doneAnd did he not in his protectorship Levy great sums of money through the realm For soldiers' pay in France and never sent it By means whereof the towns each day revoltedTut these are petty faults to faults unknown Which time will bring to light in smooth Duke HumphreyMy lords at once the care you have of us To mow down thorns that would annoy our foot Is worthy praise but shall I speak my conscience Our kinsman Gloucester is as innocent From meaning treason to our royal person As is the sucking lamb or harmless dove The Duke is virtuous mild and too well given To dream on evil or to work my downfallAh what's more dangerous than this fond affiance Seems he a dove His feathers are but borrow'd For he's disposed as the hateful raven Is he a lamb His skin is surely lent him For he's inclin'd as is the ravenous wolf Who cannot steal a shape that means deceit Take heed my lord the welfare of us all Hangs on the cutting short that fraudful manAll health unto my gracious sovereignWelcome Lord Somerset What news from FranceThat all your interest in those territories Is utterly bereft you all is lostCold news Lord Somerset but God's will be doneAside Cold news for me for I had hope of France As firmly as I hope for fertile England Thus are my blossoms blasted in the bud And caterpillars eat my leaves away But I will remedy this gear ere long Or sell my title for a glorious grave All happiness unto my lord the King Pardon my liege that I have stay'd so longNay Gloucester know that thou art come too soon Unless thou wert more loyal than thou art I do arrest thee of high treason hereWell Suffolk thou shalt not see me blush Nor change my countenance for this arrest A heart unspotted is not easily daunted The purest spring is not so free from mud As I am clear from treason to my sovereign Who can accuse me Wherein am I guilty'Tis thought my lord that you took bribes of France And being Protector stay'd the soldiers' pay By means whereof his Highness hath lost FranceIs it but thought so What are they that think it I never robb'd the soldiers of their pay Nor ever had one penny bribe from France So help me God as I have watch'd the night Ay night by night in studying good for England That doit that e'er I wrested from the King Or any groat I hoarded to my use Be brought against me at my trialday No many a pound of mine own proper store Because I would not tax the needy commons Have I dispursed to the garrisons And never ask'd for restitutionIt serves you well my lord to say so muchI say no more than truth so help me GodIn your protectorship you did devise Strange tortures for offenders never heard of That England was defam'd by tyrannyWhy 'tis well known that whiles I was Protector Pity was all the fault that was in me For I should melt at an offender's tears And lowly words were ransom for their fault Unless it were a bloody murderer Or foul felonious thief that fleec'd poor passengers I never gave them condign punishment Murder indeed that bloody sin I tortur'd Above the felon or what trespass elseMy lord these faults are easy quickly answer'd But mightier crimes are laid unto your charge Whereof you cannot easily purge yourself I do arrest you in His Highness' name And here commit you to my Lord Cardinal To keep until your further time of trialMy Lord of Gloucester 'tis my special hope That you will clear yourself from all suspense My conscience tells me you are innocentAh gracious lord these days are dangerous Virtue is chok'd with foul ambition And charity chas'd hence by rancour's hand Foul subornation is predominant And equity exil'd your Highness' land I know their complot is to have my life And if my death might make this island happy And prove the period of their tyranny I would expend it with all willingness But mine is made the prologue to their play For thousands more that yet suspect no peril Will not conclude their plotted tragedy Beaufort's red sparkling eyes blab his heart's malice And Suffolk's cloudy brow his stormy hate Sharp Buckingham unburdens with his tongue The envious load that lies upon his heart And dogged York that reaches at the moon Whose overweening arm I have pluck'd back By false accuse doth level at my life And you my sovereign lady with the rest Causeless have laid disgraces on my head And with your best endeavour have stirr'd up My liefest liege to be mine enemy Ay all of you have laid your heads together Myself had notice of your conventicles And all to make away my guiltless life I shall not want false witness to condemn me Nor store of treasons to augment my guilt The ancient proverb will be well effected 'A staff is quickly found to beat a dog'My liege his railing is intolerable If those that care to keep your royal person From treason's secret knife and traitor's rage Be thus upbraided chid and rated at And the offender granted scope of speech 'Twill make them cool in zeal unto your GraceHath he not twit our sovereign lady here With ignominious words though clerkly couch'd As if she had suborned some to swear False allegations to o'erthrow his stateBut I can give the loser leave to chideFar truer spoke than meant I lose indeed Beshrew the winners for they play'd me false And well such losers may have leave to speakHe'll wrest the sense and hold us here all day Lord Cardinal he is your prisonerSirs take away the Duke and guard him sureAh thus King Henry throws away his crutch Before his legs be firm to bear his body Thus is the shepherd beaten from thy side And wolves are gnarling who shall gnaw thee first Ah that my fear were false ah that it were For good King Henry thy decay I fear guardedMy lords what to your wisdoms seemeth best Do or undo as if ourself were hereWhat will your Highness leave the ParliamentAy Margaret my heart is drown'd with grief Whose flood begins to flow within mine eyes My body round engirt with misery For what's more miserable than discontent Ah uncle Humphrey in thy face I see The map of honour truth and loyalty And yet good Humphrey is the hour to come That e'er I prov'd thee false or fear'd thy faith What louring star now envies thy estate That these great lords and Margaret our Queen Do seek subversion of thy harmless life Thou never didst them wrong nor no man wrong And as the butcher takes away the calf And binds the wretch and beats it when it strays Bearing it to the bloody slaughterhouse Even so remorseless have they borne him hence And as the dam runs lowing up and down Looking the way her harmless young one went And can do nought but wail her darling's loss Even so myself bewails good Gloucester's case With sad unhelpful tears and with dimm'd eyes Look after him and cannot do him good So mighty are his vowed enemies His fortunes I will weep and 'twixt each groan Say 'Who's a traitor Gloucester he is none' Free lords cold snow melts with the sun's hot beams Henry my lord is cold in great affairs Too full of foolish pity and Gloucester's show Beguiles him as the mournful crocodile With sorrow snares relenting passengers Or as the snake roll'd in a flow'ring bank With shining checker'd slough doth sting a child That for the beauty thinks it excellent Believe me lords were none more wise than I And yet herein I judge mine own wit good This Gloucester should be quickly rid the world To rid us from the fear we have of himThat he should die is worthy policy But yet we want a colour for his death 'Tis meet he be condemn'd by course of lawBut in my mind that were no policy The King will labour still to save his life The commons haply rise to save his life And yet we have but trivial argument More than mistrust that shows him worthy deathSo that by this you would not have him dieAh York no man alive so fain as I'Tis York that hath more reason for his death But my Lord Cardinal and you my Lord of Suffolk Say as you think and speak it from your souls Were't not all one an empty eagle were set To guard the chicken from a hungry kite As place Duke Humphrey for the King's ProtectorSo the poor chicken should be sure of deathMadam 'tis true and were't not madness then To make the fox surveyor of the fold Who being accus'd a crafty murderer His guilt should be but idly posted over Because his purpose is not executed No let him die in that he is a fox By nature prov'd an enemy to the flock Before his chaps be stain'd with crimson blood As Humphrey prov'd by reasons to my liege And do not stand on quillets how to slay him Be it by gins by snares by subtlety Sleeping or waking 'tis no matter how So he be dead for that is good deceit Which mates him first that first intends deceitThricenoble Suffolk 'tis resolutely spokeNot resolute except so much were done For things are often spoke and seldom meant But that my heart accordeth with my tongue Seeing the deed is meritorious And to preserve my sovereign from his foe Say but the word and I will be his priestBut I would have him dead my Lord of Suffolk Ere you can take due orders for a priest Say you consent and censure well the deed And I'll provide his executioner I tender so the safety of my liegeHere is my hand the deed is worthy doingAnd so say AndAnd now we three have spoke it It skills not greatly who impugns our dooma Great lords from Ireland am I come amain To signify that rebels there are up And put the Englishmen unto the sword Send succours lords and stop the rage betime Before the wound do grow uncurable For being green there is great hope of helpA breach that craves a quick expedient stop What counsel give you in this weighty causeThat Somerset be sent as Regent thither 'Tis meet that lucky ruler be employ'd Witness the fortune he hath had in FranceIf York with all his farfet policy Had been the Regent there instead of me He never would have stay'd in France so longNo not to lose it all as thou hast done I rather would have lost my life betimes Than bring a burden of dishonour home By staying there so long till all were lost Show me one scar character'd on thy skin Men's flesh preserv'd so whole do seldom winNay then this spark will prove a raging fire If wind and fuel be brought to feed it with No more good York sweet Somerset be still Thy fortune York hadst thou been Regent there Might happily have prov'd far worse than hisWhat worse than nought Nay then a shame take allAnd in the number thee that wishest shameMy Lord of York try what your fortune is Th' uncivil kerns of Ireland are in arms And temper clay with blood of Englishmen To Ireland will you lead a band of men Collected choicely from each county some And try your hap against the IrishmenI will my lord so please his MajestyWhy our authority is his consent And what we do establish he confirms Then noble York take thou this task in handI am content provide me soldiers lords Whiles I take order for mine own affairsA charge Lord York that I will see perform'd But now return we to the false Duke HumphreyNo more of him for I will deal with him That henceforth he shall trouble us no more And so break off the day is almost spent Lord Suffolk you and I must talk of that eventMy Lord of Suffolk within fourteen days At Bristol I expect my soldiers For there I'll ship them all for IrelandI'll see it truly done my Lord of York all but Now York or never steel thy fearful thoughts And change misdoubt to resolution Be that thou hop'st to be or what thou art Resign to death it is not worth th' enjoying Let palefac'd fear keep with the meanborn man And find no harbour in a royal heart Faster than springtime show'rs comes thought on thought And not a thought but thinks on dignity My brain more busy than the labouring spider Weaves tedious snares to trap mine enemies Well nobles well 'tis politicly done To send me packing with an host of men I fear me you but warm the starved snake Who cherish'd in your breasts will sting your hearts 'Twas men I lack'd and you will give them me I take it kindly Yet be well assur'd You put sharp weapons in a madman's hands Whiles I in Ireland nourish a mighty band I will stir up in England some black storm Shall blow ten thousand souls to heaven or hell And this fell tempest shall not cease to rage Until the golden circuit on my head Like to the glorious sun's transparent beams Do calm the fury of this madbred flaw And for a minister of my intent I have seduc'd a headstrong Kentishman John Cade of Ashford To make commotion as full well he can Under the tide of John Mortimer In Ireland have I seen this stubborn Cade Oppose himself against a troop of kerns And fought so long tiff that his thighs with darts Were almost like a sharpquill'd porpentine And in the end being rescu'd I have seen Him caper upright like a wild Morisco Shaking the bloody darts as he his bells Full often like a shaghair'd crafty kern Hath he conversed with the enemy And undiscover'd come to me again And given me notice of their villainies This devil here shall be my substitute For that John Mortimer which now is dead In face in gait in speech he doth resemble By this I shall perceive the commons' mind How they affect the house and claim of York Say he be taken rack'd and tortured I know no pain they can inflict upon him Will make him say I mov'd him to those arms Say that he thrive as 'tis great like he will Why then from Ireland come I with my strength And reap the harvest which that rascal sow'd For Humphrey being dead as he shall be And Henry put apart the next for me Bury St Edmunds A room of statetwo or three running over the stage from the murder of Run to my Lord of Suffolk let him know We have dispatch'd the Duke as he commandedO that it were to do What have we done Didst ever hear a man so penitent Here comes my lordNow sirs have you dispatch'd this thingAy my good lord he's deadWhy that's well said Go get you to my house I will reward you for this venturous deed The King and all the peers are here at hand Have you laid fair the bed Is all things well According as I gave directions'Tis my good lordAway be goneSound trumpetsthethewith attendantsGo call our uncle to our presence straight Say we intend to try his Grace today If he be guilty as 'tis publishedI'll call him presently my noble lordLords take your places and I pray you all Proceed no straiter 'gainst our uncle Gloucester Than from true evidence of good esteem He be approv'd in practice culpableGod forbid any malice should prevail That faultless may condemn a nobleman Pray God he may acquit him of suspicionI thank thee Meg these words content me muchReHow now Why look'st thou pale Why tremblest thou Where is our uncle What's the matter SuffolkDead in his bed my lord Gloucester is deadMarry God forfendGod's secret judgment I did dream tonight The Duke was dumb and could not speak a wordThe swoonsHow fares my lord Help lords The King is deadRear up his body wring him by the noseRun go help help O Henry ope thine eyesHe doth revive again madam be patientO heavenly GodHow fares my gracious lordComfort my sovereign Gracious Henry comfortWhat doth my Lord of Suffolk comfort me Came he right now to sing a raven's note Whose dismal tune bereft my vital pow'rs And thinks he that the chirping of a wren By crying comfort from a hollow breast Can chase away the first conceived sound Hide not thy poison with such sug'red words Lay not thy hands on me forbear I say Their touch affrights me as a serpent's sting Thou baleful messenger out of my sight Upon thy eyeballs murderous tyranny Sits in grim majesty to fright the world Look not upon me for thine eyes are wounding Yet do not go away come basilisk And kill the innocent gazer with thy sight For in the shade of death I shall find joy In life but double death'now Gloucester's deadWhy do you rate my Lord of Suffolk thus Although the Duke was enemy to him Yet he most Christianlike laments his death And for myself foe as he was to me Might liquid tears or heartoffending groans Or bloodconsuming sighs recall his life I would be blind with weeping sick with groans Look pale as primrose with blooddrinking sighs And all to have the noble Duke alive What know I how the world may deem of me For it is known we were but hollow friends It may be judg'd I made the Duke away So shall my name with slander's tongue be wounded And princes' courts be fill'd with my reproach This get I by his death Ay me unhappy To be a queen and crown'd with infamyAh woe is me for Gloucester wretched manBe woe for me more wretched than he is What dost thou turn away and hide thy face I am no loathsome leper look on me What art thou like the adder waxen deaf Be poisonous too and kill thy forlorn Queen Is all thy comfort shut in Gloucester's tomb Why then Dame Margaret was ne'er thy joy Erect his statue and worship it And make my image but an alehouse sign Was I for this nigh wreck'd upon the sea And twice by awkward wind from England's bank Drove back again unto my native clime What boded this but wellforewarning wind Did seem to say eek not a scorpion's nest Nor set no footing on this unkind shore' What did I then but curs'd the gentle gusts And he that loos'd them forth their brazen caves And bid them blow towards England's blessed shore Or turn our stern upon a dreadful rock Yet Aeolus would not be a murderer But left that hateful office unto thee The prettyvaulting sea refus'd to drown me Knowing that thou wouldst have me drown'd on shore With tears as salt as sea through thy unkindness The splitting rocks cow'r'd in the sinking sands And would not dash me with their ragged sides Because thy flinty heart more hard than they Might in thy palace perish Margaret As far as I could ken thy chalky cliffs When from thy shore the tempest beat us back I stood upon the hatches in the storm And when the dusky sky began to rob My earnestgaping sight of thy land's view I took a costly jewel from my neck A heart it was bound in with diamonds And threw it towards thy land The sea receiv'd it And so I wish'd thy body might my heart And even with this I lost fair England's view And bid mine eyes be packing with my heart And call'd them blind and dusky spectacles For losing ken of Albion's wished coast How often have I tempted Suffolk's tongue The agent of thy foul inconstancy To sit and witch me as Ascanius did When he to madding Dido would unfold His father's acts commenc'd in burning Troy Am I not witch'd like her Or thou not false like him Ay me I can no more Die Margaret For Henry weeps that thou dost live so longNoise withinand many commonsIt is reported mighty sovereign That good Duke Humphrey traitorously is murd'red By Suffolk and the Cardinal Beaufort's means The commons like an angry hive of bees That want their leader scatter up and down And care not who they sting in his revenge Myself have calm'd their spleenful mutiny Until they hear the order of his deathThat he is dead good Warwick 'tis too true But how he died God knows not Henryhis chamber view his breathless corpse And comment then upon his sudden deathThat shall I do my liege Stay Salisbury With the rude multitude till I return with the commonsO Thou that judgest all things stay my thoughts My thoughts that labour to persuade my soul Some violent hands were laid on Humphrey's life If my suspect be false forgive me God For judgment only doth belong to Thee Fain would I go to chafe his paly lips With twenty thousand kisses and to drain Upon his face an ocean of salt tears To tell my love unto his dumb deaf trunk And with my fingers feel his hand unfeeling But all in vain are these mean obsequies And to survey his dead and earthy image What were it but to make my sorrow greaterBed put forth with the bodyCome hither gracious sovereign view this bodyThat is to see how deep my grave is made For with his soul fled all my worldly solace For seeing him I see my life in deathAs surely as my soul intends to live With that dread King that took our state upon Him To free us from his Father's wrathful curse I do believe that violent hands were laid Upon the life of this thricefamed DukeA dreadful oath sworn with a solemn tongue What instance gives Lord Warwick for his vowSee how the blood is settled in his face Oft have I seen a timelyparted ghost Of ashy semblance meagre pale and bloodless Being all descended to the labouring heart Who in the conflict that it holds with death Attracts the same for aidance 'gainst the enemy Which with the heart there cools and ne'er returneth To blush and beautify the cheek again But see his face is black and full of blood His eyeballs further out than when he liv'd Staring full ghastly like a strangled man His hair uprear'd his nostrils stretch'd with struggling His hands abroad display'd as one that grasp'd And tugg'd for life and was by strength subdu'd Look on the sheets his hair you see is sticking His wellproportion'd beard made rough and rugged Like to the summer's corn by tempest lodged It cannot be but he was murd'red here The least of all these signs were probableWhy Warwick who should do the Duke to death Myself and Beaufort had him in protection And we I hope sir are no murderersBut both of you were vow'd Duke Humphrey's foes And you forsooth had the good Duke to keep 'Tis like you would not feast him like a friend And 'tis well seen he found an enemyThen you belike suspect these noblemen As guilty of Duke Humphrey's timeless deathWho finds the heifer dead and bleeding fresh And sees fast by a butcher with an axe But will suspect 'twas he that made the slaughter Who finds the partridge in the puttock's nest But may imagine how the bird was dead Although the kite soar with unbloodied beak Even so suspicious is this tragedyAre you the butcher Suffolk Where's your knife Is Beaufort term'd a kite Where are his talonsI wear no knife to slaughter sleeping men But here's a vengeful sword rusted with ease That shall be scoured in his rancorous heart That slanders me with murder's crimson badge Say if thou dar'st proud Lord of Warwickshire That I am faulty in Duke Humphrey's death and othersWhat dares not Warwick if false Suffolk dare himHe dares not calm his contumelious spirit Nor cease to be an arrogant controller Though Suffolk dare him twenty thousand timesMadam be still with reverence may I say For every word you speak in his behalf Is slander to your royal dignityBluntwitted lord ignoble in demeanour If ever lady wrong'd her lord so much Thy mother took into her blameful bed Some stern untutor'd churl and noble stock Was graft with crabtree slip whose fruit thou art And never of the Nevils' noble raceBut that the guilt of murder bucklers thee And I should rob the deathsman of his fee Quitting thee thereby of ten thousand shames And that my sovereign's presence makes me mild I would false murd'rous coward on thy knee Make thee beg pardon for thy passed speech And say it was thy mother that thou meant'st That thou thyself was born in bastardy And after all this fearful homage done Give thee thy hire and send thy soul to hell Pernicious bloodsucker of sleeping menThou shalt be waking while I shed thy blood If from this presence thou dar'st go with meAway even now or I will drag thee hence Unworthy though thou art I'll cope with thee And do some service to Duke Humphrey's ghostWhat stronger breastplate than a heart untainted Thrice is he arm'd that hath his quarrel just And he but naked though lock'd up in steel Whose conscience with injustice is corrupted A noise withinWhat noise is thisRe andwith their weapons drawnWhy how now lords your wrathful weapons drawn Here in our presence Dare you be so bold Why what tumultuous clamour have we hereThe trait'rous Warwick with the men of Bury Set all upon me mighty sovereign Re To the Commons within Sirs stand apart the King shall know your mind Dread lord the commons send you word by me Unless Lord Suffolk straight be done to death Or banished fair England's territories They will by violence tear him from your palace And torture him with grievous ling'ring death They say by him the good Duke Humphrey died They say in him they fear your Highness' death And mere instinct of love and loyalty Free from a stubborn opposite intent As being thought to contradict your liking Makes them thus forward in his banishment They say in care of your most royal person That if your Highness should intend to sleep And charge that no man should disturb your rest In pain of your dislike or pain of death Yet notwithstanding such a strait edict Were there a serpent seen with forked tongue That slily glided towards your Majesty It were but necessary you were wak'd Lest being suffer'd in that harmful slumber The mortal worm might make the sleep eternal And therefore do they cry though you forbid That they will guard you whe'er you will or no From such fell serpents as false Suffolk is With whose envenomed and fatal sting Your loving uncle twenty times his worth They say is shamefully bereft of lifeWithin An answer from the King my Lord of Salisbury'Tis like the commons rude unpolish'd hinds Could send such message to their sovereign But you my lord were glad to be employ'd To show how quaint an orator you are But all the honour Salisbury hath won Is that he was the lord ambassador Sent from a sort of tinkers to the KingWithin An answer from the King or we will all break inGo Salisbury and tell them all from me I thank them for their tender loving care And had I not been cited so by them Yet did I purpose as they do entreat For sure my thoughts do hourly prophesy Mischance unto my state by Suffolk's means And therefore by His Majesty I swear Whose far unworthy deputy I am He shall not breathe infection in this air But three days longer on the pain of deathO Henry let me plead for gentle SuffolkUngentle Queen to call him gentle Suffolk No more I say if thou dost plead for him Thou wilt but add increase unto my wrath Had I but said I would have kept my word But when I swear it is irrevocable If after three days' space thou here be'st found On any ground that I am ruler of The world shall not be ransom for thy life Come Warwick come good Warwick go with me I have great matters to impart to theeall but and Mischance and sorrow go along with you Heart's discontent and sour affliction Be playfellows to keep you company There's two of you the devil make a third And threefold vengeance tend upon your stepsCease gentle Queen these execrations And let thy Suffolk take his heavy leaveFie coward woman and softhearted wretch Has thou not spirit to curse thine enemyA plague upon them Wherefore should I curse them Would curses kill as doth the mandrake's groan I would invent as bitter searching terms As curst as harsh and horrible to hear Deliver'd strongly through my fixed teeth With full as many signs of deadly hate As leanfac'd Envy in her loathsome cave My tongue should stumble in mine earnest words Mine eyes should sparkle like the beaten flint Mine hair be fix'd an end as one distract Ay every joint should seem to curse and ban And even now my burden'd heart would break Should I not curse them Poison be their drink Gall worse than gall the daintiest that they taste Their sweetest shade a grove of cypress trees Their chiefest prospect murd'ring basilisks Their softest touch as smart as lizards' stings Their music frightful as the serpent's hiss And boding screechowls make the consort full all the foul terrors in darkseated hellEnough sweet Suffolk thou torment'st thyself And these dread curses like the sun 'gainst glass Or like an overcharged gun recoil And turns the force of them upon thyselfYou bade me ban and will you bid me leave Now by the ground that I am banish'd from Well could I curse away a winter's night Though standing naked on a mountain top Where biting cold would never let grass grow And think it but a minute spent in sportO let me entreat thee cease Give me thy hand That I may dew it with my mournful tears Nor let the rain of heaven wet this place To wash away my woeful monuments O could this kiss be printed in thy hand That thou might'st think upon these by the seal Through whom a thousand sighs are breath'd for thee So get thee gone that I may know my grief 'Tis but surmis'd whiles thou art standing by As one that surfeits thinking on a want I will repeal thee or be well assur'd Adventure to be banished myself And banished I am if but from thee Go speak not to me even now be gone O go not yet Even thus two friends condemn'd Embrace and kiss and take ten thousand leaves Loather a hundred times to part than die Yet now farewell and farewell life with theeThus is poor Suffolk ten times banished Once by the King and three times thrice by thee 'Tis not the land I care for wert thou thence A wilderness is populous enough So Suffolk had thy heavenly company For where thou art there is the world itself With every several pleasure in the world And where thou art not desolation I can no more Live thou to joy thy life Myself no joy in nought but that thou liv'st Whither goes Vaux so fast What news I pritheeTo signify unto his Majesty That Cardinal Beaufort is at point of death For suddenly a grievous sickness took him That makes him gasp and stare and catch the air Blaspheming God and cursing men on earth Sometime he talks as if Duke Humphrey's ghost Were by his side sometime he calls the King And whispers to his pillow as to him The secrets of his overcharged soul And I am sent to tell his Majesty That even now he cries aloud for himGo tell this heavy message to the King Ay me What is this world What news are these But wherefore grieve I at an hour's poor loss Omitting Suffolk's exile my soul's treasure Why only Suffolk mourn I not for thee And with the southern clouds contend in tears Theirs for the earth's increase mine for my sorrows Now get thee hence the King thou know'st is coming If thou be found by me thou art but deadIf I depart from thee I cannot live And in thy sight to die what were it else But like a pleasant slumber in thy lap Here could I breathe my soul into the air As mild and gentle as the cradlebabe Dying with mother's dug between its lips Where from thy sight I should be raging mad And cry out for thee to close up mine eyes To have thee with thy lips to stop my mouth So shouldst thou either turn my flying soul Or I should breathe it so into thy body And then it liv'd in sweet Elysium To die by thee were but to die in jest From thee to die were torture more than death O let me stay befall what may befallAway Though parting be a fretful corrosive It is applied to a deathful wound To France sweet Suffolk Let me hear from thee For whereso'er thou art in this world's globe I'll have an Iris that shall find thee outI goAnd take my heart with thee She kisses himA jewel lock'd into the woefull'st cask That ever did contain a thing of worth Even as a splitted bark so sunder we This way fall I to deathThis way for meseverallyLondonbedchamberthe andto the in bedHow fares my lord Speak Beaufort to thy sovereignIf thou be'st Death I'll give thee England's treasure Enough to purchase such another island So thou wilt let me live and feel no painAh what a sign it is of evil life Where death's approach is seen so terribleBeaufort it is thy sovereign speaks to theeBring me unto my trial when you will Died he not in his bed Where should he die Can I make men live whe'er they will or no O torture me no more I will confess Alive again Then show me where he is I'll give a thousand pound to look upon him He hath no eyes the dust hath blinded them Comb down his hair look look it stands upright Like limetwigs set to catch my winged soul Give me some drink and bid the apothecary Bring the strong poison that I bought of himO Thou eternal Mover of the heavens Look with a gentle eye upon this wretch O beat away the busy meddling fiend That lays strong siege unto this wretch's soul And from his bosom purge this black despairSee how the pangs of death do make him grinDisturb him not let him pass peaceablyPeace to his soul if God's good pleasure be Lord Card'nal if thou think'st on heaven's bliss Hold up thy hand make signal of thy hope He dies and makes no sign O God forgive himSo bad a death argues a monstrous lifeForbear to judge for we are sinners all Close up his eyes and draw the curtain close And let us all to meditation
