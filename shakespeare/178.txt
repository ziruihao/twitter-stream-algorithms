brother's daughter's Queen of Tunis So is she heir of Naples 'twixt which regions There is some spaceA space whose ev'ry cubit Seems to cry out 'How shall that Claribel Measure us back to Naples Keep in Tunis And let Sebastian wake' Say this were death That now hath seiz'd them why they were no worse Than now they are There be that can rule Naples As well as he that sleeps lords that can prate As amply and unnecessarily As this Gonzalo I myself could make A chough of as deep chat O that you bore The mind that I do What a sleep were this For your advancement Do you understand meMethinks I doAnd how does your content Tender your own good fortuneI remember You did supplant your brother ProsperoTrue And look how well my garments sit upon me Much feater than before My brother's servants Were then my fellows now they are my menBut for your conscienceAy sir where lies that If 'twere a kibe 'Twould put me to my slipper but I feel not This deity in my bosom twenty consciences That stand 'twixt me and Milan candied be they And melt ere they molest Here lies your brother No better than the earth he lies upon If he were that which now he's likethat's dead Whom I with this obedient steel three inches of it Can lay to bed for ever whiles you doing thus To the perpetual wink for aye might put This ancient morsel this Sir Prudence who Should not upbraid our course For all the rest

honour sir I heard a humming And that a strange one too which did awake me I shak'd you sir and cried as mine eyes open'd I saw their weapons drawnthere was a noise That's verily 'Tis best we stand
