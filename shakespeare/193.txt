Plains near Romewith an army of with drums and coloursApproved warriors and my faithful friends I have received letters from great Rome Which signifies what hate they bear their Emperor And how desirous of our sight they are Therefore great lords be as your titles witness Imperious and impatient of your wrongs And wherein Rome hath done you any scath Let him make treble satisfactionBrave slip sprung from the great Andronicus Whose name was once our terror now our comfort Whose high exploits and honourable deeds Ingrateful Rome requites with foul contempt Be bold in us we'll follow where thou lead'st Like stinging bees in hottest summer's day Led by their master to the flow'red fields And be aveng'd on cursed TamoraAnd as he saith so say we all with himI humbly thank him and I thank you all But who comes here led by a lusty Goth aleading with his in his armsRenowned Lucius from our troops I stray'd To gaze upon a ruinous monastery And as I earnestly did fix mine eye Upon the wasted building suddenly I heard a child cry underneath a wall I made unto the noise when soon I heard The crying babe controll'd with this discourse 'Peace tawny slave half me and half thy dam Did not thy hue bewray whose brat thou art Had nature lent thee but thy mother's look Villain thou mightst have been an emperor But where the bull and cow are both milkwhite They never do beget a coalblack calf Peace villain peace' even thus he rates the babe 'For I must bear thee to a trusty Goth Who when he knows thou art the Empress' babe Will hold thee dearly for thy mother's sake' With this my weapon drawn I rush'd upon him Surpris'd him suddenly and brought him hither To use as you think needful of the manO worthy Goth this is the incarnate devil That robb'd Andronicus of his good hand This is the pearl that pleas'd your Empress' eye And here's the base fruit of her burning lust Say walley'd slave whither wouldst thou convey This growing image of thy fiendlike face Why dost not speak What deaf Not a word A halter soldiers Hang him on this tree And by his side his fruit of bastardyTouch not the boy he is of royal bloodToo like the sire for ever being good First hang the child that he may see it sprawl A sight to vex the father's soul withal Get me a ladder A ladder brought which is made to climbLucius save the child And bear it from me to the Emperess If thou do this I'll show thee wondrous things That highly may advantage thee to hear If thou wilt not befall what may befall I'll speak no more but 'Vengeance rot you all'Say on an if it please me which thou speak'st Thy child shall live and I will see it nourish'dAn if it please thee Why assure thee Lucius 'Twill vex thy soul to hear what I shall speak For I must talk of murders rapes and massacres Acts of black night abominable deeds Complots of mischief treason villainies Ruthful to hear yet piteously perform'd And this shall all be buried in my death Unless thou swear to me my child shall liveTell on thy mind I say thy child shall liveSwear that he shall and then I will beginWho should I swear by Thou believest no god That granted how canst thou believe an oathWhat if I do not as indeed I do not Yet for I know thou art religious And hast a thing within thee called conscience With twenty popish tricks and ceremonies Which I have seen thee careful to observe Therefore I urge thy oath For that I know An idiot holds his bauble for a god And keeps the oath which by that god he swears To that I'll urge him Therefore thou shalt vow By that same god what god soe'er it be That thou adorest and hast in reverence To save my boy to nourish and bring him up Or else I will discover nought to theeEven by my god I swear to thee I willFirst know thou I begot him on the EmpressO most insatiate and luxurious womanTut Lucius this was but a deed of charity To that which thou shalt hear of me anon 'Twas her two sons that murdered Bassianus They cut thy sister's tongue and ravish'd her And cut her hands and trimm'd her as thou sawestO detestable villain Call'st thou that trimmingWhy she was wash'd and cut and trimm'd and 'twas Trim sport for them which had the doing of itO barbarous beastly villains like thyselfIndeed I was their tutor to instruct them That codding spirit had they from their mother As sure a card as ever won the set That bloody mind I think they learn'd of me As true a dog as ever fought at head Well let my deeds be witness of my worth I train'd thy brethren to that guileful hole Where the dead corpse of Bassianus lay I wrote the letter that thy father found And hid the gold within that letter mention'd Confederate with the Queen and her two sons And what not done that thou hast cause to rue Wherein I had no stroke of mischief in it I play'd the cheater for thy father's hand And when I had it drew myself apart And almost broke my heart with extreme laughter I pried me through the crevice of a wall When for his hand he had his two sons' heads Beheld his tears and laugh'd so heartily That both mine eyes were rainy like to his And when I told the Empress of this sport She swooned almost at my pleasing tale And for my tidings gave me twenty kissesWhat canst thou say all this and never blushAy like a black dog as the saying isArt thou not sorry for these heinous deedsAy that I had not done a thousand more Even now I curse the day and yet I think Few come within the compass of my curse Wherein I did not some notorious ill As kill a man or else devise his death Ravish a maid or plot the way to do it Accuse some innocent and forswear myself Set deadly enmity between two friends Make poor men's cattle break their necks Set fire on barns and haystacks in the night And bid the owners quench them with their tears Oft have I digg'd up dead men from their graves And set them upright at their dear friends' door Even when their sorrows almost was forgot And on their skins as on the bark of trees Have with my knife carved in Roman letters 'Let not your sorrow die though I am dead' Tut I have done a thousand dreadful things As willingly as one would kill a fly And nothing grieves me heartily indeed But that I cannot do ten thousand moreBring down the devil for he must not die So sweet a death as hanging presentlyIf there be devils would I were a devil To live and burn in everlasting fire So I might have your company in hell But to torment you with my bitter tongueSirs stop his mouth and let him speak no more My lord there is a messenger from Rome Desires to be admitted to your presenceLet him come near Welcome Aemilius What's the news

by thy side where Rape and Murder stands Now give some surance that thou art Revenge Stab them or tear them on thy chariot wheels And then I'll come and be thy waggoner And whirl along with thee about the globes Provide thee two proper palfreys black as jet To hale thy vengeful waggon swift away And find out murderers in their guilty caves And when thy car is loaden with their heads I will dismount and by thy waggon wheel Trot like a servile footman all day long Even from Hyperion's rising in the east Until his very downfall in the sea And day by day I'll do this heavy task So thou destroy Rapine and Murder thereThese are my ministers and come with meAre they thy ministers What are they call'dRape and Murder therefore called so 'Cause they take vengeance of such kind of menGood Lord how

embrace thee in it by and byThis closing with him fits his lunacy Whate'er I forge to feed his brainsick humours Do you uphold and maintain in your speeches For now he firmly takes me for Revenge And being credulous in this mad thought I'll make him send for Lucius his son And whilst I at a banquet hold him sure I'll find some cunning practice out of hand To scatter and disperse the giddy Goths Or at the least make them his enemies See here he comes and I must ply my themebelowLong have I been forlorn and all for thee Welcome dread Fury to my woeful house Rapine and Murder you are welcome too How like the Empress and her sons you are Well are you fitted had you but a Moor Could not all hell afford you such a devil For well I wot the Empress never wags But in her company there is a Moor And

you how to knit again This scattered corn into one mutual sheaf These broken limbs again into one body Lest Rome herself be bane unto herself And she whom mighty kingdoms curtsy to Like a forlorn and desperate castaway Do shameful execution on herself But if my frosty signs and chaps of age Grave witnesses of true experience Cannot induce you to attend my words To LuciusSpeak Rome's dear friend as erst our ancestor When with his solemn tongue he did discourse To lovesick Dido's sad attending ear The story of that baleful burning night When subtle Greeks surpris'd King Priam's Troy Tell us what Sinon hath bewitch'd our ears Or who hath brought the fatal engine in That gives our Troy our Rome the civil wound My heart is not compact of flint nor steel Nor can I utter all our bitter grief But floods of tears will drown my oratory And break my utt'rance even in the time When it should move ye to attend me most And force you to commiseration Here's Rome's young Captain let him tell the tale While I stand by and weep to hear him speakThen gracious auditory be it known to you That Chiron and the damn'd Demetrius Were they that murd'red our Emperor's brother And they it were that ravished our sister For their fell faults our brothers were beheaded Our father's tears despis'd and basely cozen'd Of that true hand that fought Rome's quarrel out And sent her enemies unto the grave Lastly myself unkindly banished The gates shut on me and turn'd weeping out To beg relief among Rome's enemies Who drown'd their enmity in my true tears And op'd their arms to embrace me as a friend I am the turned forth be it known to you That have preserv'd her welfare in my blood And from her bosom took the enemy's point Sheathing the steel in my advent'rous body Alas you know I am no vaunter I My scars can witness dumb although they are That my report is just and full of truth But soft methinks I do digress too much Citing my worthless praise O pardon me For when no friends are by men praise themselvesNow is my turn to speak Behold the child Pointing to the in an attendant's arms Of this was Tamora delivered The issue of an irreligious Moor Chief architect and plotter of these woes The villain is alive in Titus' house Damn'd as he is to witness this is true Now judge what cause had Titus to revenge These wrongs unspeakable past patience Or more than any living man could bear Now have you heard the truth what say you Romans Have we done aught amiss show us wherein And from the place where you behold us pleading The poor remainder of Andronici Will hand in hand all headlong hurl ourselves And on the ragged stones beat forth our souls And make a mutual closure of our house Speak Romans speak and if you say we shall Lo hand in hand Lucius and I will fallCome come thou reverend man of Rome And bring our Emperor gently in thy hand Lucius our Emperor for well I know The common voice do cry it shall be soLucius all hail Rome's royal EmperorGo go into old Titus' sorrowful house And hither hale that misbelieving Moor To be adjudg'd some direful slaught'ring death As punishment for his most wicked life some attendants and the others descendLucius all hail Rome's gracious governorThanks gentle Romans May I govern so To heal Rome's harms and wipe away her woe But gentle people give me aim awhile For nature puts me to a heavy task Stand all aloof but uncle draw you near To shed obsequious tears upon this trunk O take this warm kiss on thy pale cold lipsKissesThese sorrowful drops upon thy bloodstain'd face The last true duties of thy noble sonTear for tear and loving kiss for kiss Thy brother Marcus tenders on thy lips O were the sum of these that I should pay Countless and infinite yet would I pay themCome hither boy come come come and learn of us To melt in showers Thy grandsire lov'd thee well Many a time he danc'd thee on his knee Sung thee asleep his loving breast thy pillow Many a story hath he told to thee And bid thee bear his pretty tales in mind And talk of them when he was dead and goneHow many thousand times hath these poor lips When they were living warm'd themselves on thine O now sweet boy give them their latest kiss Bid him farewell commit him to the grave Do them that kindness and take leave of themO grandsire grandsire ev'n with all my heart Would I were dead so you did live again O Lord I cannot speak to him for weeping My tears will choke me if I ope my mouth Re attendants withAYou sad Andronici have done with woes Give sentence on the execrable wretch That hath been breeder of these dire eventsSet him breastdeep in earth and famish him There let him stand and rave and cry for food If any one relieves or pities him For the offence he dies This is our doom Some stay to see him fast'ned in the earthAh why should wrath be mute and fury dumb I am no baby I that with base prayers I should repent the evils I have done Ten thousand worse than ever yet I did Would I perform if I might have my will If one good deed in all my life I did I do repent it from my very soulSome loving friends convey the Emperor hence And give him burial in his father's grave My father and Lavinia shall forthwith Be closed in our household's monument As for that ravenous tiger Tamora No funeral rite nor man in mourning weed No mournful bell shall ring her burial But throw her forth to beasts and birds to prey Her life was beastly and devoid of pity And being dead let birds on her take pity
