London An antechamber in thepalacetheand the My lord I'll tell you that self bill is urg'dWhich in th' eleventh year of the last king's reignWas like and had indeed against us pass'dBut that the scambling and unquiet timeDid push it out of farther question But how my lord shall we resist it now It must be thought on If it pass against usWe lose the better half of our possessionFor all the temporal lands which men devoutBy testament have given to the churchWould they strip from us being valu'd thusAs much as would maintain to the King's honourFull fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knightsSix thousand and two hundred good esquiresAnd to relief of lazars and weak ageOf indigent faint souls past corporal toilA hundred almshouses right well suppliedAnd to the coffers of the King besideA thousand pounds by th' year thus runs the bill This would drink deep 'T would drink the cup and all But what prevention The King is full of grace and fair regard And a true lover of the holy Church The courses of his youth promis'd it notThe breath no sooner left his father's bodyBut that his wildness mortified in himSeem'd to die too yea at that very momentConsideration like an angel cameAnd whipp'd th' offending Adam out of himLeaving his body as a paradiseT'envelop and contain celestial spiritsNever was such a sudden scholar madeNever came reformation in a floodWith such a heady currance scouring faultsNor never Hydraheaded wilfulnesSo soon did lose his seat and all at onceAs in this king We are blessed in the change Hear him but reason in divinityAnd alladmiring with an inward wishYou would desire the King were made a prelateHear him debate of commonwealth affairsYou would say it hath been all in all his studyList his discourse of war and you shall hearA fearful battle rend'red you in musicTurn him to any cause of policyThe Gordian knot of it he will unlooseFamiliar as his garter that when he speaksThe air a charter'd libertine is stillAnd the mute wonder lurketh in men's earsTo steal his sweet and honey'd sentencesSo that the art and practic part of lifeMust be the mistress to this theoricWhich is a wonder how his Grace should glean itSince his addiction was to courses vainHis companies unletter'd rude and shallowHis hours fill'd up with riots banquets sportsAnd never noted in him any studyAny retirement any sequestrationFrom open haunts and popularity The strawberry grows underneath the nettleAnd wholesome berries thrive and ripen bestNeighbour'd by fruit of baser qualityAnd so the Prince obscur'd his contemplationUnder the veil of wildness which no doubtGrew like the summer grass fastest by nightUnseen yet crescive in his faculty It must be so for miracles are ceas'dAnd therefore we must needs admit the meansHow things are perfected But my good lordHow now for mitigation of this billUrg'd by the Commons Doth his MajestyIncline to it or no He seems indifferentOr rather swaying more upon our partThan cherishing th' exhibiters against usFor I have made an offer to his MajestyUpon our spiritual convocationAnd in regard of causes now in handWhich I have open'd to his Grace at largeAs touching France to give a greater sumThan ever at one time the clergy yetDid to his predecessors part withal How did this offer seem receiv'd my lord With good acceptance of his MajestySave that there was not time enough to hearAs I perceiv'd his Grace would fain have doneThe severals and unhidden passagesOf his true tides to some certain dukedomsAnd generally to the crown and seat of FranceDeriv'd from Edward his greatgrandfather What was th' impediment that broke this off The French ambassador upon that instantCrav'd audience and the hour I think is comeTo give him hearing is it four o'clock It is Then go we in to know his embassyWhich I could with a ready guess declareBefore the Frenchman speak a word of it I'll wait upon you and I long to hear itLondon The Presence Chamber in thepalacethe and attendantsWhere is my gracious Lord of CanterburyNot here in presenceSend for him good uncleShall we call in th' ambassador my liegeNot yet my cousin we would be resolv'd Before we hear him of some things of weight That task our thoughts concerning us and FrancetheandtheGod and his angels guard your sacred throne And make you long become itSure we thank you My learned lord we pray you to proceed And justly and religiously unfold Why the law Salique that they have in France Or should or should not bar us in our claim And God forbid my dear and faithful lord That you should fashion wrest or bow your reading Or nicely charge your understanding soul With opening titles miscreate whose right Suits not in native colours with the truth For God doth know how many now in health Shall drop their blood in approbation Of what your reverence shall incite us to Therefore take heed how you impawn our person How you awake our sleeping sword of war We charge you in the name of God take heed For never two such kingdoms did contend Without much fall of blood whose guiltless drops Are every one a woe a sore complaint 'Gainst him whose wrongs gives edge unto the swords That makes such waste in brief mortality Under this conjuration speak my lord For we will hear note and believe in heart That what you speak is in your conscience wash'd As pure as sin with baptismThen hear me gracious sovereign and you peers That owe yourselves your lives and services To this imperial throne There is no bar To make against your Highness' claim to France But this which they produce from Pharamond 'In terram Salicam mulieres ne succedant' 'No woman shall succeed in Salique land' Which Salique land the French unjustly gloze To be the realm of France and Pharamond The founder of this law and female bar Yet their own authors faithfully affirm That the land Salique is in Germany Between the floods of Sala and of Elbe Where Charles the Great having subdu'd the Saxons There left behind and settled certain French Who holding in disdain the German women For some dishonest manners of their life Establish'd then this law to wit no female Should be inheritrix in Salique land Which Salique as I said 'twixt Elbe and Sala Is at this day in Germany call'd Meisen Then doth it well appear the Salique law Was not devised for the realm of France Nor did the French possess the Salique land Until four hundred one and twenty years After defunction of King Pharamond Idly suppos'd the founder of this law Who died within the year of our redemption Four hundred twentysix and Charles the Great Subdu'd the Saxons and did seat the French Beyond the river Sala in the year Eight hundred five Besides their writers say King Pepin which deposed Childeric Did as heir general being descended Of Blithild which was daughter to King Clothair Make claim and title to the crown of France Hugh Capet also who usurp'd the crown Of Charles the Duke of Lorraine sole heir male Of the true line and stock of Charles the Great To find his title with some shows of truth Though in pure truth it was corrupt and naught Convey'd himself as th' heir to th' Lady Lingare Daughter to Charlemain who was the son To Lewis the Emperor and Lewis the son Of Charles the Great Also King Lewis the Tenth Who was sole heir to the usurper Capet Could not keep quiet in his conscience Wearing the crown of France till satisfied That fair Queen Isabel his grandmother Was lineal of the Lady Ermengare Daughter to Charles the foresaid Duke of Lorraine By the which marriage the line of Charles the Great Was reunited to the Crown of France So that as clear as is the summer's sun King Pepin's title and Hugh Capet's claim King Lewis his satisfaction all appear To hold in right and tide of the female So do the kings of France unto this day Howbeit they would hold up this Salique law To bar your Highness claiming from the female And rather choose to hide them in a net Than amply to imbar their crooked tides Usurp'd from you and your progenitorsMay I with right and conscience make this claimThe sin upon my head dread sovereign For in the book of Numbers is it writ When the man dies let the inheritance Descend unto the daughter Gracious lord Stand for your own unwind your bloody flag Look back into your mighty ancestors Go my dread lord to your greatgrandsire's tomb From whom you claim invoke his warlike spirit And your greatuncle's Edward the Black Prince Who on the French ground play'd a tragedy Making defeat on the fun power of France Whiles his most mighty father on a hill Stood smiling to behold his lion's whelp Forage in blood of French nobility O noble English that could tain With half their forces the full pride of France And let another half stand laughing by All out of work and cold for actionAwake remembrance of these valiant dead And with your puissant arm renew their feats You are their heir you sit upon their throne The blood and courage that renowned them Runs in your veins and my thricepuissant liege Is in the very Maymorn of his youth Ripe for exploits and mighty prisesYour brother kings and monarchs of the earth Do all expect that you should rouse yourself As did the former lions of your bloodThey know your Grace hath cause and means and might So hath your Highness never King of England Had nobles richer and more loyal subjects Whose hearts have left their bodies here in England And lie pavilion'd in the fields of FranceO let their bodies follow my dear liege With blood and sword and fire to win your right In aid whereof we of the spiritualty Will raise your Highness such a mighty sum As never did the clergy at one time Bring in to any of your ancestorsWe must not only arm t' invade the French But lay down our proportions to defend Against the Scot who will make road upon us With all advantagesThey of those marches gracious sovereign Shall be a wall sufficient to defend Our inland from the pilfering borderersWe do not mean the coursing snatchers only But fear the main intendment of the Scot Who hath been still a giddy neighbour to us For you shall read that my greatgrandfather Never went with his forces into France But that the Scot on his unfurnish'd kingdom Came pouring like the tide into a breach With ample and brim fulness of his force Galling the gleaned land with hot assays Girdling with grievous siege castles and towns That England being empty of defence Hath shook and trembled at th' ill neighbourhoodShe hath been then more fear'd than harm'd my liege For hear her but exampled by herself When all her chivalry hath been in France And she a mourning widow of her nobles She hath herself not only well defended But taken and impounded as a stray The King of Scots whom she did send to France To fill King Edward's fame with prisoner kings And make her chronicle as rich with praise As is the ooze and bottom of the sea With sunken wreck and sumless treasuriesBut there's a saying very old and true 'If that you will France win Then with Scotland first begin' For once the eagle England being in prey To her unguarded nest the weasel Scot Comes sneaking and so sucks her princely eggs Playing the mouse in absence of the cat To tear and havoc more than she can eatIt follows then the cat must stay at home Yet that is but a crush'd necessity Since we have locks to safeguard necessaries And pretty traps to catch the petty thieves While that the armed hand doth fight abroad Th' advised head defends itself at home For government though high and low and lower Put into parts doth keep in one consent Congreeing in a full and natural close Like musicTherefore doth heaven divide The state of man in divers functions Setting endeavour in continual motion To which is fixed as an aim or but Obedience for so work the honey bees Creatures that by a rule in nature teach The act of order to a peopled kingdom They have a king and officers of sorts Where some like magistrates correct at home Others like merchants venture trade abroad Others like soldiers armed in their stings Make boot upon the summer's velvet buds Which pillage they with merry march bring home To the tentroyal of their emperor Who busied in his majesty surveys The singing masons building roofs of gold The civil citizens kneading up the honey The poor mechanic porters crowding in Their heavy burdens at his narrow gate The sadey'd justice with his surly hum Delivering o'er to executors pale The lazy yawning drone I this infer That many things having full reference To one consent may work contrariously As many arrows loosed several ways Come to one mark as many ways meet in one town As many fresh streams meet in one salt sea As many lines close in the dial's centre So many a thousand actions once afoot End in one purpose and be all well home Without defeat Therefore to France my liege Divide your happy England into four Whereof take you one quarter into France And you withal shall make all Gallia shake If we with thrice such powers left at home Cannot defend our own doors from the dog Let us be worried and our nation lose The name of hardiness and policyCall in the messengers sent from the Dauphinsome attendants Now are we well resolv'd and by God's help And yours the noble sinews of our power France being ours we'll bend it to our awe Or break it all to pieces or there we'll sit Ruling in large and ample empery O'er France and all her almost kingly dukedoms Or lay these bones in an unworthy urn Tombless with no remembrance over them Either our history shall with full mouth Speak freely of our acts or else our grave Like Turkish mute shall have a tongueless mouth Not worshipp'd with a waxen epitaphof France Now are we well prepar'd to know the pleasure Of our fair cousin Dauphin for we hear Your greeting is from him not from the KingMay't please your Majesty to give us leave Freely to render what we have in charge Or shall we sparingly show you far of The Dauphin's meaning and our embassyWe are no tyrant but a Christian king Unto whose grace our passion is as subject As are our wretches fett'red in our prisons Therefore with frank and with uncurbed plainness Tell us the Dauphin's mindThus then in few Your Highness lately sending into France Did claim some certain dukedoms in the right Of your great predecessor King Edward the Third In answer of which claim the Prince our master Says that you savour too much of your youth And bids you be advis'd there's nought in France That can be with a nimble galliard won You cannot revel into dukedoms there He therefore sends you meeter for your spirit This tun of treasure and in lieu of this Desires you let the dukedoms that you claim Hear no more of you This the Dauphin speaksWhat treasure uncleTennisballs my liegeWe are glad the Dauphin is so pleasant with us His present and your pains we thank you for When we have match'd our rackets to these balls We will in France by God's grace play a set Shall strike his father's crown into the hazard Tell him he hath made a match with such a wrangler That all the courts of France will be disturb'd With chaces And we understand him well How he comes o'er us with our wilder days Not measuring what use we made of them We never valu'd this poor seat of England And therefore living hence did give ourself To barbarous licence as 'tis ever common That men are merriest when they are from home But tell the Dauphin I will keep my state Be like a king and show my sail of greatness When I do rouse me in my throne of France For that I have laid by my majesty And plodded like a man for workingdays But I will rise there with so full a glory That I will dazzle all the eyes of France Yea strike the Dauphin blind to look on us And tell the pleasant Prince this mock of his Hath turn'd his balls to gunstones and his soul Shall stand sore charged for the wasteful vengeance That shall fly with them for many a thousand widows Shall this his mock mock of their dear husbands Mock mothers from their sons mock castles down And some are yet ungotten and unborn That shall have cause to curse the Dauphin's scorn But this lies all within the will of God To whom I do appeal and in whose name Tell you the Dauphin I am coming on To venge me as I may and to put forth My rightful hand in a wellhallow'd cause So get you hence in peace and tell the Dauphin His jest will savour but of shallow wit When thousands weep more than did laugh at it Convey them with safe conduct Fare you wellThis was a merry messageWe hope to make the sender blush at it Therefore my lords omit no happy hour That may give furth'rance to our expedition For we have now no thought in us but France Save those to God that run before our business Therefore let our proportions for these wars Be soon collected and all things thought upon That may with reasonable swiftness ad More feathers to our wings for God before We'll chide this Dauphin at his father's door Therefore let every man now task his thought That this fair action may on foot be brought
