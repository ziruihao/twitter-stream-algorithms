London A street The trumpets soundthe and othersWelcome sweet Prince to London to your chamberWelcome dear cousin my thoughts' sovereign The weary way hath made you melancholyNo uncle but our crosses on the way Have made it tedious wearisome and heavy I want more uncles here to welcome meSweet Prince the untainted virtue of your years Hath not yet div'd into the world's deceit Nor more can you distinguish of a man Than of his outward show which God He knows Seldom or never jumpeth with the heart Those uncles which you want were dangerous Your Grace attended to their sug'red words But look'd not on the poison of their hearts God keep you from them and from such false friendsGod keep me from false friends but they were noneMy lord the Mayor of London comes to greet youthe and his trainGod bless your Grace with health and happy daysI thank you good my lord and thank you all I thought my mother and my brother York Would long ere this have met us on the way Fie what a slug is Hastings that he comes not To tell us whether they will come or noAnd in good time here comes the sweating LordWelcome my lord What will our mother comeOn what occasion God He knows not I The Queen your mother and your brother York Have taken sanctuary The tender Prince Would fain have come with me to meet your Grace But by his mother was perforce withheldFie what an indirect and peevish course Is this of hers Lord Cardinal will your Grace Persuade the Queen to send the Duke of York Unto his princely brother presently If she deny Lord Hastings go with him And from her jealous arms pluck him perforceMy Lord of Buckingham if my weak oratory Can from his mother win the Duke of York Anon expect him here but if she be obdurate To mild entreaties God in heaven forbid We should infringe the holy privilege Of blessed sanctuary Not for all this land Would I be guilty of so deep a sinYou are too senselessobstinate my lord Too ceremonious and traditional Weigh it but with the grossness of this age You break not sanctuary in seizing him The benefit thereof is always granted To those whose dealings have deserv'd the place And those who have the wit to claim the place This Prince hath neither claim'd it nor deserv'd it And therefore in mine opinion cannot have it Then taking him from thence that is not there You break no privilege nor charter there Oft have I heard of sanctuary men But sanctuary children never till nowMy lord you shall o'errule my mind for once Come on Lord Hastings will you go with meI go my lordGood lords make all the speedy haste you may Say uncle Gloucester if our brother come Where shall we sojourn till our coronationWhere it seems best unto your royal self If I may counsel you some day or two Your Highness shall repose you at the Tower Then where you please and shall be thought most fit For your best health and recreationI do not like the Tower of any place Did Julius Caesar build that place my lordHe did my gracious lord begin that place Which since succeeding ages have reedifiedIs it upon record or else reported Successively from age to age he built itUpon record my gracious lordBut say my lord it were not regist'red Methinks the truth should Eve from age to age As 'twere retail'd to all posterity Even to the general allending day AsideSo wise so young they say do never live longWhat say you uncleI say without characters fame lives long AsideThus like the formal vice Iniquity I moralize two meanings in one wordThat Julius Caesar was a famous man With what his valour did enrich his wit His wit set down to make his valour live Death makes no conquest of this conqueror For now he lives in fame though not in life I'll tell you what my cousin BuckinghamWhat my gracious lordAn if I live until I be a man I'll win our ancient right in France again Or die a soldier as I liv'd a king AsideShort summers lightly have a forward spring youngand the Now in good time here comes the Duke of YorkRichard of York how fares our loving brotherWell my dread lord so must I can you nowAy brother to our grief as it is yours Too late he died that might have kept that title Which by his death hath lost much majestyHow fares our cousin noble Lord of YorkI thank you

would that I might thank you as you call meHowLittleMy Lord of York will still be cross in talk Uncle your Grace knows how to bear with himYou mean to bear me not to bear with me Uncle my brother mocks both you and me Because that I am little like an ape He thinks that you should bear me on your shouldersWith what a sharpprovided wit he reasons To mitigate the scorn he gives his uncle He prettily and aptly taunts himself So cunning and so young is wonderfulMy lord will't please you pass along Myself and my good cousin Buckingham Will to your mother to entreat of her To meet you at the Tower and welcome youWhat will you go unto the Tower my lordMy Lord Protector needs will have it soI shall not sleep in quiet at the TowerWhy what should you fearMarry my uncle Clarence' angry ghost My grandam told me he was murder'd thereI fear no uncles deadNor none that live I hopeAn if they live I hope I need not fear But come my lord and with a heavy heart Thinking on them go I unto the Tower A sennetall but and Think you my lord this little prating York Was not incensed by his subtle mother To taunt and scorn you thus opprobriouslyNo doubt no doubt O 'tis a perilous boy Bold quick ingenious forward capable He is all the mother's from the top to toeWell let them rest Come hither Catesby Thou art sworn as deeply to effect what we intend As closely to conceal what we impart Thou know'st our reasons urg'd upon the way What think'st thou Is it not an easy matter To make William Lord Hastings of our mind For the instalment of this noble Duke In the seat royal of this famous isleHe for his father's sake so loves the Prince That he will not be won to aught against himWhat think'st thou then of Stanley Will not heHe will do all in all as Hastings dothWell then no more but this go gentle Catesby And as it were far off sound thou Lord Hastings How he doth stand affected to our purpose And summon him tomorrow to the Tower To sit about the coronation If thou dost find him tractable to us Encourage him and tell him all our reasons If he be leaden icy cold unwilling Be thou so too and so break off the talk And give us notice of his inclination For we tomorrow hold divided councils Wherein thyself shalt highly be employ'dCommend me to Lord William Tell him Catesby His ancient knot of dangerous adversaries Tomorrow are let blood at Pomfret Castle And bid my lord for joy of this good news Give Mistress Shore one gentle kiss the moreGood Catesby go effect this business soundlyMy good lords both with all the heed I canShall we hear from you Catesby ere we sleepYou shall my lordAt Crosby House there shall you find us bothNow my lord what shall we do if we perceive Lord Hastings will not yield to our complotsChop off his headsomething we will determine And look when I am King claim thou of me The earldom of Hereford and all the movables Whereof the King my brother was possess'dI'll claim that promise at your Grace's handAnd look to have it yielded with all kindness Come let us sup betimes that afterwards We may digest our complots in some form Beforehousea to the door of My lord my lordKnocking WithinWho knocksOne from the Lord Stanley WithinWhat is't o'clockUpon the stroke of fourCannot my Lord Stanley sleep these tedious nightsSo it appears by that I have to say First he commends him to your noble selfWhat thenThen certifies your lordship that this night He dreamt the boar had razed off his helm Besides he says there are two councils kept And that may be determin'd at the one Which may make you and him to rue at th' other Therefore he sends to know your lordship's pleasure If you will presently take horse with him And with all speed post with him toward the north To shun the danger that his soul divinesGo fellow go return unto thy lord Bid him not fear the separated council His honour and myself are at the one And at the other is my good friend Catesby Where nothing can proceed that toucheth us Whereof I shall not have intelligence Tell him his fears are shallow without instance And for his dreams I wonder he's so simple To trust the mock'ry of unquiet slumbers To fly the boar before the boar pursues Were to incense the boar to follow us And make pursuit where he did mean no chase Go bid thy master rise and come to me And we will both together to the Tower Where he shall see the boar will use us kindlyI'll go my lord and tell him what you say Many good morrows to my noble lordGood morrow Catesby you are early stirring What news what news in this our tott'ring stateIt is a reeling world indeed my lord And I believe will never stand upright Till Richard wear the garland of the realmHow wear the garland Dost thou mean the crownAy my good lordI'll have this crown of mine cut from my shoulders Before I'll see the crown so foul misplac'd But canst thou guess that he doth aim at itAy on my life and hopes to find you forward Upon his party for the gain thereof And thereupon he sends you this good news That this same very day your enemies The kindred of the Queen must die at PomfretIndeed I am no mourner for that news Because they have been still my adversaries But that I'll give my voice on Richard's side To bar my master's heirs in true descent God knows I will not do it to the deathGod keep your lordship in that gracious mindBut I shall laugh at this a twelve month hence That they which brought me in my master's hate I live to look upon their tragedy Well Catesby ere a fortnight make me older I'll send some packing that yet think not on't'Tis a vile thing to die my gracious lord When men are unprepar'd and look not for itO monstrous monstrous And so falls it out With Rivers Vaughan Grey and so 'twill do With some men else that think themselves as safe As thou and I who as thou knowest are dear To princely Richard and to BuckinghamThe Princes both make high account of you AsideFor they account his head upon the bridgeI know they do and I have well deserv'd it Come on come on where is your boarspear man Fear you the boar and go so unprovidedMy lord good morrow good morrow Catesby You may jest on but by the holy rood I do not like these several councils My lord I hold my life as dear as yours And never in my days I do protest Was it so precious to me as 'tis now Think you but that I know our state secure I would be so triumphant as I amThe lords at Pomfret when they rode from London Were jocund and suppos'd their states were sure And they indeed had no cause to mistrust But yet you see how soon the day o'ercast This sudden stab of rancour I misdoubt Pray God I say I prove a needless coward What shall we toward the Tower The day is spentCome come have with you Wot you what my Lord Today the lords you talk'd of are beheadedThey for their truth might better wear their heads Than some that have accus'd them wear their hats But come my lord let's awaya pursuivantGo on before I'll talk with this good fellow How now Hastings How goes the world with theeThe better that your lordship please to askI tell thee man 'tis better with me now Than when thou met'st me last where now we meet Then was I going prisoner to the Tower By the suggestion of the Queen's allies But now I tell theekeep it to thyself This day those enernies are put to death And I in better state than e'er I wasGod hold it to your honour's good contentGramercy Hastings there

next Sabbath and I will content you He whispers in his earI'll wait upon your lordshipWhat talking with a priest Lord Chamberlain Your friends at Pomfret they do need the priest Your honour hath no shriving work in handGood faith and when I met this holy man The men you talk of came into my mind What go you toward the TowerI do my lord but long I cannot stay there I shall return before your lordship thenceNay like enough for I stay dinner there AsideAnd supper too although thou knowest it not Come will you goI'll wait upon your lordshipPomfret Castle with halberds carrying the Nobles

thy walls the Second here was hack'd to death And for more slander to thy dismal seat We give to thee our guiltless blood to drinkNow Margaret's curse is fall'n upon our heads When she exclaim'd on Hastings you and I For standing by when Richard stabb'd her sonThen curs'd she Richard then curs'd she Buckingham Then curs'd she Hastings O remember God To hear her prayer for them as now for us And for my sister and her princely sons Be satisfied dear God with our true blood Which as thou know'st unjustly must be spiltMake haste the hour of death is expiateCome Grey come Vaughan let us here

speakwhen is the royal dayIs all things ready for the royal timeIt is and wants but nomination Tomorrow then I judge a happy dayWho knows the Lord Protector's mind herein Who is most inward with the noble Duke Your Grace we think should soonest know his mindWe know each other's faces for our hearts He knows no more of mine than I of yours Or I of his my lord than you of mine Lord Hastings you and he are near in loveI thank his Grace I know he loves me well But for his purpose in the coronation I have not sounded him nor he deliver'd His gracious pleasure any way therein But you my honourable lords may name the time And in the Duke's behalf I'll give my voice Which I presume he'll take in gentle partIn happy time here comes the Duke himselfMy noble lords and cousins an good morrow I have been long a sleeper but I trust My absence doth neglect no great design Which by my presence might have been concludedHad you not come upon your cue my lord Lord Hastings had pronounc'd your part I mean your voice for crowning of the KingThan my Lord Hastings no man might be bolder His lordship knows me well and loves me well My lord of Ely when I was last in Holborn I saw good strawberries in your garden there I do beseech you send for some of them ofMarry and will my lord with all my heartCousin of Buckingham a word with youTakes him aside Catesby hath sounded Hastings in our business And finds the testy gentleman so hot That he will lose his head ere give consent His master's child as worshipfully he terms it Shall lose the royalty of England's throneWithdraw yourself awhile I'll go with youWe have not yet set down this day of triumph Tomorrow in my judgment is too sudden For I myself am not so well provided As else I would be were the day prolong'd Re the Where is my lord the Duke of Gloucester I have sent for these strawberriesHis Grace looks cheerfully and smooth this morning There's some conceit or other likes him well When that he bids good morrow with such spirit I think there's never a man in Christendom Can lesser hide his love or hate than he For by his face straight shall you know his heartWhat of his heart perceive you in his face By any livelihood he show'd todayMarry that with no man here he is offended For were he he had shown it in his looksRe and I pray you all tell me what they deserve That do conspire my death with devilish plots Of damned witchcraft and that have prevail'd Upon my body with their hellish charmsThe tender love I bear your Grace my lord Makes me most forward in this princely presence To doom th' offenders whosoe'er they be I say my lord they have deserved deathThen be your eyes the witness of their evil Look how I am bewitch'd behold mine arm Is like a blasted sapling wither'd up And this is Edward's wife that monstrous witch Consorted with that harlot strumpet Shore That by their witchcraft thus have marked meIf they have done this deed my noble lordIfthou protector of this damned strumpet Talk'st thou to me of ifs Thou art a traitor Off with his head Now by Saint Paul I swear I will not dine until I see the same Lovel and Ratcliff look that it be done The rest that love me rise and follow meall but and Woe woe for England not a whit for me For I too fond might have prevented this did dream the boar did raze our helms And I did scorn it and disdain to fly Three times today my footcloth horse did stumble And started when he look'd upon the Tower As loath to bear me to the slaughterhouse O now I need the priest that spake to me I now repent I told the pursuivant As too triumphing how mine enemies Today at Pomfret bloodily were butcher'd And I myself secure in grace and favour O Margaret Margaret now thy heavy curse Is lighted on poor Hastings' wretched headCome come dispatch the Duke would be at dinner Make a short shrift he longs to see your headO momentary grace of mortal men Which we more hunt for than the grace of God Who builds his hope in air of your good looks Lives like a drunken sailor on a mast Ready with every nod to tumble down Into the fatal bowels of the deepCome come dispatch 'tis bootless to exclaimO bloody Richard Miserable England I prophesy the fearfull'st time to thee That ever wretched age hath look'd upon Come lead me to the block bear him my head They smile at me who shortly shall be deadLondon The Towerwallsand in rotten armour marvellous illfavouredCome cousin canst thou quake and change thy colour Murder thy breath in middle of a word And then again begin and stop again As if thou were distraught and mad with terrorTut I can counterfeit the deep tragedian Speak and look back and pry on every side Tremble and start at wagging of a straw Intending deep suspicion Ghastly looks Are at my service like enforced smiles And both are ready in their offices At any time to grace my stratagems But what is Catesby goneHe is and see he brings the mayor along the and Lord MayorLook to the drawbridge thereHark a drumCatesby o'erlook the wallsLord Mayor the reason we have sentLook back defend thee here are enemiesGod and our innocence defend and guard us andwith ' headBe patient they are friendsRatcliff and LovelHere is the head of that ignoble traitor The dangerous and unsuspected HastingsSo dear I lov'd the man that I must weep I took him for the plainest harmless creature That breath'd upon the earth a Christian Made him my book wherein my soul recorded The history of all her secret thoughts So smooth he daub'd his vice with show of virtue That his apparent open guilt omitted I mean his conversation with Shore's wife He liv'd from all attainder of suspectsWell well he was the covert'st shelt'red traitor That ever liv'd Would you imagine or almost believe Were't not that by great preservation We live to tell itthat the subtle traitor This day had plotted in the councilhouse To murder me and my good Lord of GloucesterHad he done soWhat think you we are Turks or Infidels Or that we would against the form of law Proceed thus rashly in the villain's death But that the extreme peril of the case The peace of England and our persons' safety Enforc'd us to this executionNow fair befall you He deserv'd his death And your good Graces both have well proceeded To warn false traitors from the like attempts I never look'd for better at his hands After he once fell in with Mistress ShoreYet had we not determin'd he should die Until your lordship came to see his end Which now the loving haste of these our friends Something against our meanings have prevented Because my lord I would have had you heard The traitor speak and timorously confess The manner and the purpose of his treasons That you might well have signified the same Unto the citizens who haply may Misconster us in him and wail his deathBut my good lord your Grace's words shall serve As well as I had seen and heard him speak And do not doubt right noble Princes both But I'll acquaint our duteous citizens With all your just proceedings in this causeAnd to that end we wish'd your lordship here T' avoid the the the censures of the carping worldWhich since you come too late of our intent Yet witness what you hear we did intend And so my good Lord Mayor we bid farewell Go after after cousin Buckingham The Mayor towards Guildhall hies him in an post There at your meet'st advantage of the time Infer the bastardy of Edward's children Tell them how Edward put to death a citizen Only for saying he would make his son Heir to the crownmeaning indeed his house Which by the sign thereof was termed so Moreover urge his hateful luxury And bestial appetite in change of lust Which stretch'd unto their servants daughters wives Even where his raging eye or savage heart Without control lusted to make a prey Nay for a need thus far come near my person Tell them when that my mother went with child Of that insatiate Edward noble York My princely father then had wars in France And by true computation of the time Found that the issue was not his begot Which well appeared in his lineaments Being nothing like the noble Duke my father Yet touch this sparingly as 'twere far off Because my lord you know my mother livesDoubt not my lord I'll play the orator As if the golden fee for which I plead Were for myself and so my lord adieuIf you thrive well bring them to Baynard's Castle Where you shall find me well accompanied With reverend fathers and well learned bishopsI go and towards three or four o'clock Look for the news that the Guildhall affords Go Lovel with all speed to Doctor Shaw To Go thou to Friar Penker Bid them both Meet me within this hour at Baynard's Castle all butNow will I go to take some privy order To draw the brats of Clarence out of sight And to give order that no manner person Have any time recourse unto the Princes London A streeta Here is the indictment of the good Lord Hastings Which in a set hand fairly is engross'd That it may be today read o'er in Paul's And mark how well the sequel hangs together Eleven hours I have spent to write it over For yesternight by Catesby was it sent me The precedent was full as long adoing And yet within these five hours Hastings liv'd Untainted unexamin'd free at liberty Here's a good world the while Who is so gros That cannot see this palpable device Yet who's so bold but says he sees it not Bad is the world and all will come to nought When such ill dealing must be seen in thought London Baynard's Castleandat several doorsHow now how now What say the citizensNow by the holy Mother of our Lord The citizens are mum say not a wordTouch'd you the bastardy of Edward's childrenI did with his contract with Lady Lucy And his contract by deputy in France Th' insatiate greediness of his desire And his enforcement of the city wives His tyranny for trifles his own bastardy As being got your father then in France And his resemblance being not like the Duke Withal I did infer your lineaments Being the right idea of your father Both in your form and nobleness of mind Laid open all your victories in Scotland Your discipline in war wisdom in peace Your bounty virtue fair humility Indeed left nothing fitting for your purpose Untouch'd or slightly handled in discourse And when mine oratory drew toward end I bid them that did love their country's good Cry 'God save Richard England's royal King'And did they soNo so God help me they spake not a word But like dumb statues or breathing stones Star'd each on other and look'd deadly pale Which when I saw I reprehended them And ask'd the Mayor what meant this wilfull silence His answer was the people were not used To be spoke to but by the Recorder Then he was urg'd to tell my tale again 'Thus saith the Duke thus hath the Duke inferr'd' But nothing spoke in warrant from himself When he had done some followers of mine own At lower end of the hall hurl'd up their caps And some ten voices cried 'God save King Richard' And thus I took the vantage of those few 'Thanks gentle citizens and friends' quoth I 'This general applause and cheerful shout Argues your wisdoms and your love to Richard' And even here brake off and came awayWhat tongueless blocks were they Would they not speak Will not the Mayor then and his brethren comeThe Mayor is here at hand Intend some fear Be not you spoke with but by mighty suit And look you get a prayerbook in your hand And stand between two churchmen good my lord For on that ground I'll make a holy descant And be not easily won to our requests Play the maid's part still answer nay and take itI go and if you plead as well for them As I can say nay to thee for myself No doubt we bring it to a happy issueGo go up to the leads the Lord Mayor knocksthe and citizens Welcome my lord I dance attendance here I think the Duke will not be spoke withalNow Catesby what says your lord to my requestHe doth entreat your Grace my noble lord To visit him tomorrow or next day He is within with two right reverend fathers Divinely bent to meditation And in no worldly suits would he be mov'd To draw him from his holy exerciseReturn good Catesby to the gracious Duke Tell him myself the Mayor and Aldermen In deep designs in matter of great moment No less importing than our general good Are come to have some conference with his GraceI'll signify so much unto him straightAh ha my lord this prince is not an Edward He is not lolling on a lewd lovebed But on his knees at meditation Not dallying with a brace of courtezans But meditating with two deep divines Not sleeping to engross his idle body But praying to enrich his watchful soul Happy were England would this virtuous prince Take on his Grace the sovereignty thereof But sure I fear we shall not win him to itMarry God defend his Grace should say us nayI fear he will Here Catesby comes again ReNow Catesby what says his GraceMy lord He wonders to what end you have assembled Such troops of citizens to come to him His Grace not being warn'd thereof before He fears my lord you mean no good to himSorry I am my noble cousin should Suspect me that I mean no good to him By heaven we come to him in perfect love And so once more return and tell his Grace When holy and devout religious men Are at their beads 'tis much to draw them thence So sweet is zealous contemplation aloft between tworeturnsSee where his Grace stands 'tween two clergymenTwo props of virtue for a Christian prince To stay him from the fall of vanity And see a book of prayer in his hand True ornaments to know a holy man Famous Plantagenet most gracious Prince Lend favourable ear to our requests And pardon us the interruption Of thy devotion and right Christian zealMy lord there needs no such apology I do beseech your Grace to pardon me Who earnest in the service of my God Deferr'd the visitation of my friends But leaving this what is your Grace's pleasureEven that I hope which pleaseth God above And all good men of this ungovern'd isleI do suspect I have done some offence That seems disgracious in the city's eye And that you come to reprehend my ignoranceYou have my lord Would it might please your Grace On our entreaties to amend your faultElse wherefore breathe I in a Christian landKnow then it is your fault that you resign The supreme seat the throne majestical The scept'red office of your ancestors Your state of fortune and your due of birth The lineal glory of your royal house To the corruption of a blemish'd stock Whiles in the mildness of your sleepy thoughts Which here we waken to our country's good The noble isle doth want her proper limbs Her face defac'd with scars of infamy Her royal stock graft with ignoble plants And almost should'red in the swallowing gulf Of dark forgetfulness and deep oblivion Which to recure we heartily solicit Your gracious self to take on you the charge And kingly government of this your land Not as protector steward substitute Or lowly factor for another's gain But as successively from blood to blood Your right of birth your empery your own For this consorted with the citizens Your very worshipful and loving friends And by their vehement instigation In this just cause come I to move your GraceI cannot tell if to depart in silence Or bitterly to speak in your reproof Best fitteth my degree or your condition If not to answer you might haply think Tonguetied ambition not replying yielded To bear the golden yoke of sovereignty Which fondly you would here impose on me If to reprove you for this suit of yours So season'd with your faithful love to me Then on the other side I check'd my friends Thereforeto speak and to avoid the first And then in speaking not to incur the last Definitively thus I answer you Your love deserves my thanks but my desert Unmeritable shuns your high request First if all obstacles were cut away And that my path were even to the crown As the ripe revenue and due of birth Yet so much is my poverty of spirit So mighty and so many my defects That I would rather hide me from my greatness Being a bark to brook no mighty sea Than in my greatness covet to be hid And in the vapour of my glory smother'd But God be thank'd there is no need of me And much I need to help you were there need The royal tree hath left us royal fruit Which mellow'd by the stealing hours of time Will well become the seat of majesty And make no doubt us happy by his reign On him I lay that you would lay on me The right and fortune of his happy stars Which God defend that I should wring from himMy lord this argues conscience in your Grace But the respects thereof are nice and trivial All circumstances well considered You say that Edward is your brother's son So say we too but not by Edward's wife For first was he contract to Lady Lucy Your mother lives a witness to his vow And afterward by substitute betroth'd To Bona sister to the King of France These both put off a poor petitioner A carecraz'd mother to a many sons A beautywaning and distressed widow Even in the afternoon of her best days Made prize and purchase of his wanton eye Seduc'd the pitch and height of his degree To base declension and loath'd bigamy By her in his unlawful bed he got This Edward whom our manners call the Prince More bitterly could I expostulate Save that for reverence to some alive I give a sparing limit to my tongue Then good my lord take to your royal self This proffer'd benefit of dignity If not to bless us and the land withal Yet to draw forth your noble ancestry From the corruption of abusing times Unto a lineal truederived courseDo good my lord your citizens entreat youRefuse not mighty lord this proffer'd loveO make them joyful grant their lawful suitAlas why would you heap this care on me I am unfit for state and majesty I do beseech you take it not amiss I cannot nor I will not yield to youIf you refuse itas in love and zeal Loath to depose the child your brother's son As well we know your tenderness of heart And gentle kind effeminate remorse Which we have noted in you to your kindred And egally indeed to all estates Yet know whe'er you accept our suit or no Your brother's son shall never reign our king But we will plant some other in the throne To the disgrace and downfall of your house And in this resolution here we leave you Come citizens Zounds I'll entreat no moreO do not swear my lord of Buckinghamand citizensCall him again sweet Prince accept their suit If you deny them all the land will rue itWill you enforce me to a world of cares Call them again I am not made of stones But penetrable to your kind entreaties Albeit against my conscience and my soul Re and the rest Cousin of Buckingham and sage grave men Since you will buckle fortune on my back To bear her burden whe'er I will or no I must have patience to endure the load But if black scandal or foulfac'd reproach Attend the sequel of your imposition Your mere enforcement shall acquittance me From all the impure blots and stains thereof For God doth know and you may partly see How far I am from the desire of thisGod bless your Grace We see it and will say itIn saying so you shall but say the truthThen I salute you with this royal title Long live King Richard England's worthy KingAmenTomorrow may it please you to be crown'dEven when you please for you will have it soTomorrow then we will attend your Grace And so most joyfully we take our leave To the Come let us to our holy work again Farewell my cousin farewell gentle friends
