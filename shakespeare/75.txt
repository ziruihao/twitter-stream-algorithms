let me liveIn vain thou speak'st poor boy my father's blood Hath stopp'd the passage where thy words should Then let my father's blood open it again He is a man and Clifford cope with himHad I thy brethren here their lives and thine Were not revenge sufficient for me No if I digg'd up thy forefathers' graves And hung their rotten coffins up in chains It could not slake mine ire nor ease my heart The sight of any of the house of York Is as a fury to torment my soul And till I root out their accursed line And leave not one alive I live in hell ThereforeO let me pray before I take my death To thee I pray sweet Clifford pity meSuch pity as my rapier's point affordsI never did thee harm why wilt thou slay meThy father hathBut 'twas ere I was born Thou hast one son for his sake pity me

father slew my father therefore die Stabs himDi faciant laudis summa sit ista tuae DiesPlantagenet I come Plantagenet And this thy son's blood cleaving to my blade Shall rust upon my weapon till thy blood Congeal'd with this do make me wipe off bothAnother part of the field AlarumtheThe army of the Queen hath got the field My uncles both are slain in rescuing me And all my followers to the eager foe Turn back and fly like ships before the wind Or lambs pursu'd by hungerstarved wolves My sons God knows what hath bechanced them But this I know they have demean'd themselves Like men born to renown by life or death Three times did Richard make a lane to me And thrice cried 'Courage father fight it out' And full as oft came Edward to my side With purple falchion painted to the hilt In blood of those that had encount'red him And when the hardiest warriors did retire Richard cried 'Charge and give no foot of ground' And cried 'A crown or else a glorious tomb A sceptre or an earthly sepulchre' With this we charg'd again but out alas We bodg'd again as I have seen a swan With bootless labour swim against the tide And spend her strength with overmatching wavesA short alarum within Ah hark The fatal followers do pursue And I am faint and cannot fly their fury And were I strong I would not shun their fury The sands are numb'red that make up my life Here must I stay and here my life must end the and soldiers Come bloody Clifford rough Northumberland I dare your quenchless fury to more rage I am your butt and I abide your shotYield to our mercy proud PlantagenetAy to such mercy as his ruthless arm With downright payment show'd unto my father Now Phaethon hath tumbled from his car And made an evening at the noontide prickMy ashes as the phoenix may bring forth A bird that will revenge upon you all And in that hope I throw mine eyes to heaven Scorning whate'er you can afflict me with Why come you not What multitudes and fearSo cowards fight when they can fly no further So doves do peck the falcon's piercing talons So desperate thieves all hopeless of their lives Breathe out invectives 'gainst the officersO Clifford but bethink thee once again And in thy thought o'errun my former time And if thou canst for blushing view this face And bite thy tongue that slanders him with cowardice Whose frown hath made thee faint and fly ere thisI will not bandy with thee word for word But buckler with thee blows twice two for oneHold valiant Clifford for a thousand causes I would prolong awhile the traitor's life Wrath makes him deaf speak thou NorthumberlandHold Clifford do not honour him so much To prick thy finger though to wound his heart What valour were it when a cur doth grin For one to thrust his hand between his teeth When he might spurn him with his foot away It is war's prize to take all vantages And ten to one is no impeach of valourThey lay hands onwho strugglesAy ay so strives the woodcock with the ginSo doth the cony struggle in the netSo triumph thieves upon their conquer'd booty So true men yield with robbers so o'ermatch'dWhat would your Grace have done unto him nowBrave warriors Clifford and Northumberland Come make him stand upon this molehill here That raught at mountains with outstretched arms Yet parted but the shadow with his hand What was it you that would be England's king Was't you that revell'd in our parliament And made a preachment of your high descent Where are your mess of sons to back you now The wanton Edward and the lusty George And where's that valiant crookback prodigy Dicky your boy that with his grumbling voice Was wont to cheer his dad in mutinies Or with the rest where is your darling Rutland Look York I stain'd this napkin with the blood That valiant Clifford with his rapier's point Made issue from the bosom of the boy And if thine eyes can water for his death I give thee this to dry thy cheeks withal Alas poor York but that I hate thee deadly I should lament thy miserable state I prithee grieve to make me merry York What hath thy fiery heart so parch'd thine entrails That not a tear can fall for Rutland's death Why art thou patient man Thou shouldst be mad And I to make thee mad do mock thee thus Stamp rave and fret that I may sing and dance Thou wouldst be fee'd I see to make me sport York cannot speak unless he wear a crown A crown for Yorkand lords bow low to him Hold you his hands whilst I do set it onPutting a paper crown on his head Ay marry sir now looks he like a king Ay this is he that took King Henry's chair And this is he was his adopted heir But how is it that great Plantagenet Is crown'd so soon and broke his solemn oath As I bethink me you should not be King Till our King Henry had shook hands with death And will you pale your head in Henry's glory And rob his temples of the diadem Now in his life against your holy oath O 'tis a fault too too Off with the crown and with the crown his head And whilst we breathe take time to do him deadThat is my office for my father's sakeNay stay let's hear the orisons he makesShewolf of France but worse than wolves of France Whose tongue more poisons than the adder's tooth How illbeseeming is it in thy sex To triumph like an Amazonian trull Upon their woes whom fortune captivates But that thy face is visardlike unchanging Made impudent with use of evil deeds I would assay proud queen to make thee blush To tell thee whence thou cam'st of whom deriv'd Were shame enough to shame thee wert thou not shameless Thy father bears the type of King of Naples Of both the Sicils and Jerusalem Yet not so wealthy as an English yeoman Hath that poor monarch taught thee to insult It needs not nor it boots thee not proud queen Unless the adage must be verified That beggars mounted run their horse to death 'Tis beauty that doth oft make women proud But God He knows thy share thereof is small 'Tis virtue that doth make them most admir'd The contrary doth make thee wond'red at 'Tis government that makes them seem divine The want thereof makes thee abominable Thou art as opposite to every good As the Antipodes are unto us Or as the south to the septentrion O tiger's heart wrapp'd in a woman's hide How couldst thou drain the lifeblood of the child To bid the father wipe his eyes withal And yet be seen to bear a woman's face Women are soft mild pitiful and flexible Thou stern obdurate flinty rough remorseless Bid'st thou me rage Why now thou hast thy wish Wouldst have me weep Why now thou hast thy will For raging wind blows up incessant showers And when the rage allays the rain begins These tears are my sweet Rutland's obsequies And every drop cries vengeance for his death 'Gainst thee fell Clifford and thee false FrenchwomanBeshrew me but his passions move me so That hardly can I check my eyes from tearsThat face of his the hungry cannibals Would not have touch'd would not have stain'd with blood But you are more inhuman more inexorable O ten times more than tigers of Hyrcania See ruthless queen a hapless father's tears This cloth thou dipp'dst in blood of my sweet boy And I with tears do wash the blood away Keep thou the napkin and go boast of this And if thou tell'st the heavy story right Upon my soul the hearers will shed tears Yea even my foes will shed fastfalling tears And say 'Alas it was a piteous deed' There take the crown and with the crown my curse And in thy need such comfort come to thee As now I reap at thy too cruel hand Hardhearted Clifford take me from the world My soul to heaven my blood upon your headsHad he been slaughterman to all my kin I should not for my life but weep with him To see how inly sorrow gripes his soulWhat weepingripe my Lord Northumberland Think but upon the wrong he did us all And that will quickly dry thy melting tearsHere's for my oath here's for my father's death Stabbing himAnd here's to right our gentlehearted king Stabbing himOpen Thy gate of mercy gracious God My soul flies through these wounds to seek out Thee DiesOff with his head and set it on York gates So York may overlook the town of York Flourish
