Westminster A streettwoat several doorsWhither away so fastO God save ye Ev'n to the Hall to hear what shall become Of the great Duke of BuckinghamI'll save you That labour sir All's now done but the ceremony Of bringing back the prisonerWere you thereYes indeed was Pray speak what has happen'dYou may guess quickly whatIs he found guiltyYes truly is he and condemn'd upon'tI am sorry for'tSo are a number moreBut pray how pass'd itI'll tell you in a little The great Duke Came to the bar where to his accusations He pleaded still not guilty and alleged Many sharp reasons to defeat the law The King's attorney on the contrary Urg'd on the examinations proofs confessions Of divers witnesses which the Duke desir'd To have brought viva voce to his face At which appear'd against him his surveyor Sir Gilbert Peck his chancellor and John Car Confessor to him with that devilmonk Hopkins that made this mischiefThat was he That fed him with his propheciesThe same All these accus'd him strongly which he fain Would have flung from him but indeed he could not And so his peers upon this evidence Have found him guilty of high treason Much He spoke and learnedly for life but all Was either pitied in him or forgottenAfter all this how did he bear himselfWhen he was brought again to th' bar to hear His knell rung out his judgment he was stirr'd With such an agony he sweat extremely And something spoke in choler ill and hasty But he fell to himself again and sweetly In all the rest show'd a most noble patienceI do not think he fears deathSure he does not He never was so womanish the cause He may a little grieve atCertainly The Cardinal is the end of this'Tis likely By all conjectures first Kildare's attainder Then deputy of Ireland who remov'd Earl Surrey was sent thither and in haste too Lest he should help his fatherThat trick of state Was a deep envious oneAt his return No doubt he will requite it This is noted And generally whoever the King favours The Cardinal instantly will find employment And far enough from court tooAll the commons Hate him perniciously and o' my conscience Wish him ten fathom deep this Duke as much They love and dote on call him bounteous Buckingham The mirror of all courtesyfrom his arraignment tipstaves before him the axe with the edge towards him halberds on each side accompanied with and common people etcStay there sir And see the noble ruin'd man you speak ofLet's stand close and behold himAll good people You that thus far have come to pity me Hear what I say and then go home and lose me I have this day receiv'd a traitor's judgment And by that name must die yet heaven bear witness And if I have a conscience let it sink me Even as the axe falls if I be not faithful The law I bear no malice for my death 'T has done upon the premises but justice But those that sought it I could wish more Christians Be what they will I heartily forgive 'em Yet let 'em look they glory not in mischief Nor build their evils on the graves of great men For then my guiltless blood must cry against 'em For further life in this world I ne'er hope Nor will I sue although the King have mercies More than I dare make faults You few that lov'd me And dare be bold to weep for Buckingham His noble friends and fellows whom to leave Is only bitter to him only dying Go with me like good angels to my end And as the long divorce of steel falls on me Make of your prayers one sweet sacrifice And lift my soul to heaven Lead on a God's nameI do beseech your Grace for charity If ever any malice in your heart Were hid against me now to forgive me franklySir Thomas Lovell I as free forgive you As I would be forgiven I forgive all There cannot be those numberless offences 'Gainst me that I cannot take peace with No black envy Shall mark my grave Commend me to his Grace And if he speak of Buckingham pray tell him You met him half in heaven My vows and prayers Yet are the King's and till my soul forsake Shall cry for blessings on him May he live Longer than I have time to tell his years Ever belov'd and loving may his rule be And when old time Shall lead him to his end Goodness and he fill up one monumentTo th' water side I must conduct your Grace Then give my charge up to Sir Nicholas Vaux Who undertakes you to your endPrepare there The Duke is coming see the barge be ready And fit it with such furniture as suits The greatness of his personNay Sir Nicholas Let it alone my state now will but mock me When I came hither I was Lord High Constable And Duke of Buckingham now poor Edward Bohun Yet I am richer than my base accusers That never knew what truth meant I now seal it And with that blood will make 'em one day groan fort My noble father Henry of Buckingham Who first rais'd head against usurping Richard Flying for succour to his servant Banister Being distress'd was by that wretch betray'd And without trial fell God's peace be with him Henry the Seventh succeeding truly pitying My father's loss like a most royal prince Restor'd me to my honours and out of ruins Made my name once more noble Now his son Henry the Eighth life honour name and all That made me happy at one stroke has taken For ever from the world I had my trial And must needs say a noble one which makes me A little happier than my wretched father Yet thus far we are one in fortunes both Fell by our servants by those men we lov'd most A most unnatural and faithless service Heaven has an end in all Yet you that hear me This from a dying man receive as certain Where you are liberal of your loves and counsels Be sure you be not loose for those you make friends And give your hearts to when they once perceive The least rub in your fortunes fall away Like water from ye never found again But where they mean to sink ye All good people Pray for me I must now forsake ye the last hour Of my long weary life is come upon me Farewell And when you would say something that is sad Speak how I fell I have done and God forgive metrainO this is full of pity Sir it calls I fear too many curses on their heads That were the authorsIf the Duke be guiltless 'Tis full of woe yet I can give you inkling Of an ensuing evil if it fall Greater than thisGood angels keep it from us What may it be You do not doubt my faith sirThis secret is so weighty 'twill require A strong faith to conceal itLet me have it I do not talk muchI am confident You shall sir Did you not of late days hear A buzzing of a separation Between the King and KatharineYes but it held not For when the King once heard it out of anger He sent command to the Lord Mayor straight To stop the rumour and allay those tongues That durst disperse itBut that slander sir Is found a truth now for it grows again Fresher than e'er it was and held for certain The King will venture at it Either the Cardinal Or some about him near have out of malice To the good Queen possess'd him with a scruple That will undo her To confirm this too Cardinal Campeius is arriv'd and lately As all think for this business'Tis the Cardinal And merely to revenge him on the Emperor For not bestowing on him at his asking The archbishopric of Toledo this is purpos'dI think you have hit the mark but is't not cruel That she should feel the smart of this The Cardinal Will have his will and she must fall'Tis woeful We are too open here to argue this Let's think in private more London The palacethe reading this

the conscience Fears and despairsand all these for his marriage And out of all these to restore the King He counsels a divorce a loss of her That like a jewel has hung twenty years About his neck yet

humblest manner I require your Highness That it shall please you to declare in hearing Of all these earsfor where I am robb'd and bound There must I be unloos'd although not there At once and fully satisfiedwhether ever I Did broach this business to your Highness or Laid any scruple in your way which might Induce you to the question on't or ever Have to you but with thanks to God for such A royal lady spake one the least word that might Be to the prejudice of her present state Or touch of her good personMy Lord Cardinal I do excuse you yea upon mine honour I free you from't You are not to be taught That you have many enemies that know not Why they are so but like to village curs Bark when their fellows do By some of these The Queen is put in anger Y'are excus'd But will you be more justified You ever Have wish'd the sleeping of this business never desir'd It to be stirr'd but oft have hind'red oft The passages made toward it On my honour I speak my good Lord Cardinal to this point And thus far clear him Now what mov'd me to't I will be bold with time and your attention Then mark th' inducement Thus it camegive heed to't My conscience first receiv'd a tenderness Scruple and prick on certain speeches utter'd By th' Bishop of Bayonne then French ambassador Who had been hither sent on the debating A marriage 'twixt the Duke of Orleans and Our daughter Mary I' th' progress of this business Ere a determinate resolution he I mean the Bishopdid require a respite Wherein he might the King his lord advertise Whether our daughter were legitimate Respecting this our marriage with the dowager Sometimes our brother's wife This respite shook The bosom of my conscience 'd me Yea with a splitting power and made to tremble The region of my breast which forc'd such way That many maz'd considerings did throng And press'd in with this caution First methought I stood not in the smile of heaven who had Commanded nature that my lady's womb If it conceiv'd a male child by me should Do no more offices of life to't than The grave does to the dead for her male issue Or died where they were made or shortly after This world had air'd them Hence I took a thought This was a judgment on me that my kingdom Well worthy the best heir o' th' world should not Be gladded in't by me Then follows that I weigh'd the danger which my realms stood in By this my issue's fail and that gave to me Many a groaning throe Thus hulling in The wild sea of my conscience I did steer Toward this remedy whereupon we are Now present here together that's to say I meant to rectify my conscience which I then did feel full sick and yet not well By all the reverend fathers of the land And doctors learn'd First I began in private With you my Lord of Lincoln you remember How under my oppression I

mighty moment in't And consequence of dreadthat I committed The daring'st counsel which I had to doubt And did entreat your Highness to this course Which you are running hereI then mov'd you My Lord of Canterbury and got your leave To make this present summons Unsolicited I left no reverend person in this court But by particular consent proceeded Under your hands and seals therefore go on For no dislike i' th' world against the person Of the good Queen but the sharp thorny points Of my alleged reasons drives this forward Prove but our marriage lawful by my life And kingly dignity we are contented To wear our moral state to come with her Katharine our queen before the primest creature That's paragon'd o' th' worldSo please your Highness The Queen being absent 'tis a needful fitness That we adjourn this court till further day Meanwhile must be an earnest motion Made to the Queen to call back her appeal She intends unto his Holiness AsideI may perceive These cardinals trifle with me I abhor This dilatory sloth and tricks of Rome My learn'd and wellbeloved servant Cranmer Prithee return With thy approach I know My comfort comes along Break up the court I say set on Exuent in
