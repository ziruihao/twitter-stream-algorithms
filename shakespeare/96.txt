Antony'sThus Brutus did my master bid me kneel Thus did Mark Antony bid me fall down And being prostrate thus he bade me say Brutus is noble wise valiant and honest Caesar was mighty bold royal and loving Say I love Brutus and I honor him Say I fear'd Caesar honor'd him and loved him If Brutus will vouchsafe that Antony May safely come to him and be resolved How Caesar hath deserved to lie in death Mark Antony shall not love Caesar dead So well as Brutus living but will follow The fortunes and affairs of noble Brutus Thorough the hazards of this untrod state With all true faith So says my master AntonyThy master is a wise and valiant Roman I never thought him worse Tell him so please him come unto this place He shall be satisfied and by my honor Depart untouch'dI'll fetch him presently I know that we shall have him well to friendI wish we may but yet have I a mind That fears him much and my misgiving still Falls shrewdly to the purpose Re AntonyBut here comes Antony Welcome Mark AntonyO mighty Caesar Dost thou lie so low Are all thy conquests glories triumphs spoils Shrunk to this little measure Fare thee well I know not gentlemen what you intend Who else must be let blood who else is rank If I myself there is no hour so fit As Caesar's death's hour nor no instrument Of half that worth as those your swords made rich With the most noble blood of all this world I do beseech ye if you bear me hard Now whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke Fulfill your pleasure Live a thousand years I shall not find myself so apt to die No place will please me so no means of death As here by Caesar and by you cut off The choice and master spirits of this ageO Antony beg not your death of us Though now we must appear bloody and cruel As by our hands and this our present act You see we do yet see you but our hands And this the bleeding business they have done Our hearts you see not they are pitiful And pity to the general wrong of Rome As fire drives out fire so pity pity Hath done this deed on Caesar For your part To you our swords have leaden points Mark Antony Our arms in strength of malice and our hearts Of brothers' temper do receive you in With all kind love good thoughts and reverenceYour voice shall be as strong as any man's In the disposing of new dignitiesOnly be patient till we have appeased The multitude beside themselves with fear And then we will deliver you the cause Why I that did love Caesar when I struck him Have thus proceededI doubt not of your wisdom Let each man render me his bloody hand First Marcus Brutus will I shake with you Next Caius Cassius do I take your hand Now Decius Brutus yours now yours Metellus Yours Cinna and my valiant Casca yours Though last not least in love yours good Trebonius Gentlemen all alas what shall I say My credit now stands on such slippery ground That one of two bad ways you must conceit me Either a coward or a flatterer That I did love thee Caesar O 'tis true If then thy spirit look upon us now Shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death To see thy Antony making his peace Shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes Most noble In the presence of thy corse Had I as many eyes as thou hast wounds Weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood It would become me better than to close In terms of friendship with thine enemies Pardon me Julius Here wast thou bay'd brave hart Here didst thou fall and here thy hunters stand Sign'd in thy spoil and crimson'd in thy Lethe O world thou wast the forest to this hart And this indeed O world the heart of thee How like a deer strucken by many princes Dost thou here lieMark AntonyPardon me Caius Cassius The enemies of Caesar shall say this Then in a friend it is cold modestyI blame you not for praising Caesar so But what compact mean you to have with us Will you be prick'd in number of our friends Or shall we on and not depend on youTherefore I took your hands but was indeed Sway'd from the point by looking down on Caesar Friends am I with you all and love you all Upon this hope that you shall give me reasons Why and wherein Caesar was dangerousOr else were this a savage spectacle Our reasons are so full of good regard That were you Antony the son of Caesar You should be satisfiedThat's all I seek And am moreover suitor that I may Produce his body to the marketplace And in the pulpit as becomes a friend Speak in the order of his funeralYou shall Mark AntonyBrutus a word with you Aside to Brutus You know not what you do Do not consent That Antony speak in his funeral Know you how much the people may be moved By that which he will utterBy your pardon I will myself into the pulpit first And show the reason of our Caesar's death What Antony shall speak I will protest He speaks by leave and by permission And that we are contented Caesar shall Have all true rites and lawful ceremonies It shall advantage more than do us wrongI know not what may fall I like it notMark Antony here take you Caesar's body You shall not in your funeral speech blame us But speak all good you can devise of Caesar And say you do't by our permission Else shall you not have any hand at all About his funeral And you shall speak In the same pulpit whereto I am going After my speech is endedBe it so I do desire no morePrepare the body then and follow usall but AntonyO pardon me thou bleeding piece of earth That I am meek and gentle with these butchers Thou art the ruins of the noblest man That ever lived in the tide of times Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood Over thy wounds now do I prophesy Which like dumb mouths do ope their ruby lips To beg the voice and utterance of my tongue A curse shall light upon the limbs of men Domestic fury and fierce civil strife Shall cumber all the parts of Italy Blood and destruction shall be so in use And dreadful objects so familiar That mothers shall but smile when they behold Their infants quarter'd with the hands of war All pity choked with custom of fell deeds And Caesar's spirit ranging for revenge With Ate by his side come hot from hell Shall in these confines with a monarch's voice Cry Havoc and let slip the dogs of war That this foul deed shall smell above the earth With carrion men groaning for buriala Servant You serve Octavius Caesar do you notI do Mark AntonyCaesar did write for him to come to RomeHe did receive his letters and is coming And bid me say to you by word of mouth O Caesar Sees the bodyThy heart is big get thee apart and weep Passion I see is catching for mine eyes Seeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine Began to water Is thy master comingHe lies tonight within seven leagues of RomePost back with speed and tell him what hath chanced Here is a mourning Rome a dangerous Rome No Rome of safety for Octavius yet Hie hence and tell him so Yet stay awhile Thou shalt not back till I have borne this corse Into the marketplace There shall I try In my oration how the people take The cruel issue of these bloody men According to the which thou shalt discourse To young Octavius of the state of things Lend me your hand with Caesar's bodyThe ForumBrutus and Cassius and a throng of CitizensWe will be satisfied Let us be satisfiedThen follow me and give me audience friends Cassius go you into the other street And part the numbers Those that will hear me speak let 'em stay here Those that will follow Cassius go with him And public reasons shall be rendered Of Caesar's deathI will hear Brutus speakI will hear Cassius and compare their reasons When severally we hear them rendered Cassius with some Citizens Brutus goes into the pulpitThe noble Brutus is ascended SilenceBe patient till the last Romans countrymen and lovers Hear me for my cause and be silent that you may hear Believe me for mine honor and have respect to mine honor that you may believe Censure me in your wisdom and awake your senses that you may the better judge If there be any in this assembly any dear friend of Caesar's to him I say that Brutus' love to Caesar was no less than his If then that friend demand why Brutus rose against Caesar this is my answer Not that I loved Caesar less but that I loved Rome more Had you rather Caesar were living and die all slaves than that Caesar were dead to live all freemen As Caesar loved me I weep for him as he was fortunate I rejoice at it as he was valiant I honor him but as he was ambitious I slew him There is tears for his love joy for his fortune honor for his valor and death for his ambition Who is here so base that would be a bondman If any speak for him have I offended Who is here so rude that would not be a Roman If any speak for him have I offended Who is here so vile that will not love his country If any speak for him have I offended I pause for a replyNone Brutus noneThen none have I offended I have done no more to Caesar than you shall do to Brutus The question of his death is enrolled in the Capitol his glory not extenuated wherein he was worthy nor his offenses enforced for which he suffered deathAntony and others with Caesar's body Here comes his body mourned by Mark Antony who though he had no hand in his death shall receive the benefit of his dying a place in the commonwealth as which of you shall not With this I depart that as I slew my best lover for the good of Rome I have the same dagger for myself when it shall please my country to need my deathLive Brutus live liveBring him with triumph home unto his houseGive him a statue with his ancestorsLet him be CaesarCaesar's better parts Shall be crown'd in BrutusWe'll bring him to his house with shouts and clamorsMy countrymenPeace Silence Brutus speaksPeace hoGood countrymen let me depart alone And for my sake stay here with Antony Do grace to Caesar's corse and grace his speech Tending to Caesar's glories which Mark Antony By our permission is allow'd to make I do entreat you not a man depart Save I alone till Antony have spokeStay ho and let us hear Mark AntonyLet him go up into the public chair We'll hear him Noble Antony go upFor Brutus' sake I am beholding to youGoes into the pulpitWhat does he say of BrutusHe says for Brutus' sake He finds himself beholding to us all'Twere best he speak no harm of Brutus hereThis Caesar was a tyrantNay that's certain We are blest that Rome is rid of himPeace Let us hear what Antony can sayYou gentle RomansPeace ho Let us hear himFriends Romans countrymen lend me your ears I come to bury Caesar not to praise him The evil that men do lives after them The good is oft interred with their bones So let it be with Caesar The noble Brutus Hath told you Caesar was ambitious If it were so it was a grievous fault And grievously hath Caesar answer'd it Here under leave of Brutus and the rest For Brutus is an honorable man So are they all all honorable men Come I to speak in Caesar's funeral He was my friend faithful and just to me But Brutus says he was ambitious And Brutus is an honorable man He hath brought many captives home to Rome Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill Did this in Caesar seem ambitious When that the poor have cried Caesar hath wept Ambition should be made of sterner stuff Yet Brutus says he was ambitious And Brutus is an honorable man You all did see that on the Lupercal I thrice presented him a kingly crown Which he did thrice refuse Was this ambition Yet Brutus says he was ambitious And sure he is an honorable man I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke But here I am to speak what I do know You all did love him once not without cause What cause withholds you then to mourn for him O judgement thou art fled to brutish beasts And men have lost their reason Bear with me My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar And I must pause till it come back to meMethinks there is much reason in his sayingsIf thou consider rightly of the matter Caesar has had great wrongHas he masters I fear there will a worse come in his placeMark'd ye his words He would not take the crown Therefore 'tis certain he was not ambitiousIf it be found so some will dear abide itPoor soul his eyes are red as fire with weepingThere's not a nobler man in Rome than AntonyNow mark him he begins again to speakBut yesterday the word of Caesar might Have stood against the world Now lies he there And none so poor to do him reverence O masters If I were disposed to stir Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage I should do Brutus wrong and Cassius wrong Who you all know are honorable men I will not do them wrong I rather choose To wrong the dead to wrong myself and you Than I will wrong such honorable men But here's a parchment with the seal of Caesar I found it in his closet 'tis his will Let but the commons hear this testament Which pardon me I do not mean to read And they would go and kiss dead Caesar's wounds And dip their napkins in his sacred blood Yea beg a hair of him for memory And dying mention it within their wills Bequeathing it as a rich legacy Unto their issueWe'll hear the will Read it Mark AntonyThe will the will We will hear Caesar's willHave patience gentle friends I must not read it It is not meet you know how Caesar loved you You are not wood you are not stones but men And being men hearing the will of Caesar It will inflame you it will make you mad 'Tis good you know not that you are his heirs For if you should O what would come of itRead the will we'll hear it Antony You shall read us the will Caesar's willWill you be patient Will you stay awhile I have o'ershot myself to tell you of it I fear I wrong the honorable men Whose daggers have stabb'd Caesar I do fear itThey were traitors Honorable menThe will The testamentThey were villains murtherers The will Read the willYou will compel me then to read the will Then make a ring about the corse of Caesar And let me show you him that made the will Shall I descend And will you give me leaveCome downDescend He comes down from the pulpitYou shall have leaveA ring stand roundStand from the hearse stand from the bodyRoom for Antony most noble AntonyNay press not so upon me stand far offStand back room bear backIf you have tears prepare to shed them now You all do know this mantle I remember The first time ever Caesar put it on 'Twas on a summer's evening in his tent That day he overcame the Nervii Look in this place ran Cassius' dagger through See what a rent the envious Casca made Through this the wellbeloved Brutus stabb'd And as he pluck'd his cursed steel away Mark how the blood of Caesar follow'd it As rushing out of doors to be resolved If Brutus so unkindly knock'd or no For Brutus as you know was Caesar's angel Judge O you gods how dearly Caesar loved him This was the most unkindest cut of all For when the noble Caesar saw him stab Ingratitude more strong than traitors' arms Quite vanquish'd him Then burst his mighty heart And in his mantle muffling up his face Even at the base of Pompey's statue Which all the while ran blood great Caesar fell O what a fall was there my countrymen Then I and you and all of us fell down Whilst bloody treason flourish'd over us O now you weep and I perceive you feel The dint of pity These are gracious drops Kind souls what weep you when you but behold Our Caesar's vesture wounded Look you here Here is himself marr'd as you see with traitorsO piteous spectacleO noble CaesarO woeful dayO traitors villainsO most bloody sightWe will be revengedRevenge About Seek Burn Fire Kill Slay Let not a traitor liveStay countrymenPeace there Hear the noble AntonyWe'll hear him we'll follow him we'll die with himGood friends sweet friends let me not stir you up To such a sudden flood of mutiny They that have done this deed are honorable What private griefs they have alas I know not That made them do it They are wise and honorable And will no doubt with reasons answer you I come not friends to steal away your hearts I am no orator as Brutus is But as you know me all a plain blunt man That love my friend and that they know full well That gave me public leave to speak of him For I have neither wit nor words nor worth Action nor utterance nor the power of speech To stir men's blood I only speak right on I tell you that which you yourselves do know Show you sweet Caesar's wounds poor dumb mouths And bid them speak for me But were I Brutus And Brutus Antony there were an Antony Would ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue In every wound of Caesar that should move The stones of Rome to rise and mutinyWe'll mutinyWe'll burn the house of BrutusAway then Come seek the conspiratorsYet hear me countrymen yet hear me speakPeace
