The woodandlying asleepand Bottom and other attending behind unseenCome sit thee down upon this flow'ry bed While I thy amiable cheeks do coy And stick muskroses in thy sleek smooth head And kiss thy

scratchWhat wilt thou hear some music my sweet loveI have a reasonable good ear in music Let's have the tongs and the bonesOr say sweet love what thou desirest to eatTruly a peck of provender I could munch your good dry oats Methinks I have a great desire to a bottle of hay Good hay sweet hay hath no fellowI have a venturous fairy that shall seek The squirrel's hoard and fetch thee new nutsI had rather have a handful or two of dried peas But I pray you let none of your people stir me I have an exposition of sleep come upon meSleep thou and I will wind thee in my arms Fairies be gone and be all ways away So doth the woodbine the sweet honeysuckle Gently entwist the female ivy so Enrings the barky fingers of the elm O how I love thee how I dote on thee They sleep Advancing Welcome good Robin Seest thou this sweet sight Her dotage now I do begin to pity For meeting her of late behind the wood Seeking sweet favours for this hateful fool I did upbraid her and fall out with her For she his hairy temples then had rounded With coronet of fresh and fragrant flowers And that same dew which sometime on the buds Was wont to swell like round and orient pearls Stood now within the pretty flowerets' eyes Like tears that did their own disgrace bewail When I had at my pleasure taunted her And she in mild terms begg'd my patience I then did ask of her her changeling child Which straight she gave me and her fairy sent To bear him to my bower in fairy land And now I have the boy I will undo This hateful imperfection of her eyes And gentle Puck take this transformed scalp From off the head of this Athenian swain That he awaking when the other do May all to Athens back again repair And think no more of this night's accidents But as the fierce vexation of a dream But first I will release the Fairy QueenTouching her eyesBe as thou wast wont to beSee as thou was wont to seeDian's bud o'er Cupid's flowerHath such force and blessed power Now my Titania wake you my sweet queenMy Oberon What visions have I seen Methought I was enamour'd of an assThere lies your loveHow came these things to pass O how mine eyes do loathe his visage nowSilence awhile Robin take off this head Titania music call and strike more dead Than common sleep of all these five the senseMusic ho music such as charmeth sleepNow when thou wak'st with thine own fool's eyes peepSound music Come my Queen take hands with meMusic And rock the ground whereon these sleepers be Now thou and I are new in amity And will tomorrow midnight solemnly Dance in Duke Theseus' house triumphantly And bless it to all fair prosperity There shall the pairs of faithful lovers be Wedded with Theseus an in jollityFairy King attend and mark I do hear the morning larkThen my Queen in silence sad Trip we after night's shade We the globe can compass soon Swifter than the wand'ring moon Come my lord and in our flight Tell me how it came this night That I sleeping here was found With these mortals on the groundTo the winding of horns and trainGo one of you find out the forester For now our observation is perform'd And since we have the vaward of the day My love shall hear the music of my hounds Uncouple in the western valley let them go Dispatch I say and find the forester anWe will fair Queen up to the mountain's top And mark the musical confusion Of hounds and echo in conjunctionI was with Hercules and Cadmus once When in a wood of Crete they bay'd the bear With hounds of Sparta never did I hear Such gallant chiding for besides the groves The skies the fountains every region near Seem'd all one mutual cry I never heard So musical a discord such sweet thunderMy hounds are bred out of the Spartan kind So flew'd so sanded and their heads are hung With ears that sweep away the morning dew Crookknee'd and dewlapp'd like Thessalian bulls Slow in pursuit but match'd in mouth like bells Each under each A cry more tuneable Was never holla'd to nor cheer'd with horn In Crete in Sparta nor in Thessaly Judge when you hear But soft what nymphs are theseMy lord this is my daughter here asleep And this Lysander this Demetrius is This Helena old Nedar's Helena I wonder of their being here togetherNo doubt they rose up early to observe The rite of May and hearing our intent Came here in grace of our solemnity But speak Egeus is not this the day That Hermia should give answer of her choiceIt is my lordGo bid the huntsmen wake them with their hornsHorns and shout within The sleepersawake and kneel toGoodmorrow friends Saint Valentine is past Begin these woodbirds but to couple nowPardon my lordI pray you all stand up I know you two are rival enemies How comes this gentle concord in the world That hatred is so far from jealousy To sleep by hate and fear no enmityMy lord I shall reply amazedly Half sleep half waking but as yet I swear I cannot truly say how I came here But as I think for truly would I speak And now I do bethink me so it is I came with Hermia hither Our intent Was to be gone from Athens where we might Without the peril of the Athenian lawEnough enough my Lord you have enough I beg the law the law upon his head They would have stol'n away they would Demetrius Thereby to have defeated you and me You of your wife and me of my consent Of my consent that she should be your wifeMy lord fair Helen told me of their stealth Of this their purpose hither to this wood And I in fury hither followed them Fair Helena in fancy following me But my good lord I wot not by what power But by some power it is my love to Hermia Melted as the snow seems to me now As the remembrance of an idle gaud Which in my childhood I did dote upon And all the faith the virtue of my heart The object and the pleasure of mine eye Is only Helena To her my lord Was I betroth'd ere I saw Hermia But like a sickness did I loathe this food But as in health come to my natural taste Now I do wish it love it long for it And will for evermore be true to itFair lovers you are fortunately met Of this discourse we more will hear anon Egeus I will overbear your will For in the temple by and by with us These couples shall eternally be knit And for the morning now is something worn Our purpos'd hunting shall be set aside Away with us to Athens three and three We'll hold a feast in great solemnity Come Hippolytaand trainThese things seem small and undistinguishable Like faroff mountains turned into cloudsMethinks I see these things with parted eye When every thing seems doubleSo methinks And I have found Demetrius like a jewel Mine own and not mine ownAre you sure That we are awake It seems to me That yet we sleep we dream Do not you think The Duke was here and bid us follow himYea and my fatherAnd HippolytaAnd he did bid us follow to the templeWhy then we are awake let's follow him And by the way let us recount our dreams Awaking When my cue comes call me and I will answer My next is 'Most fair Pyramus' Heighho Peter Quince Flute the bellowsmender Snout the tinker Starveling God's my life stol'n hence and left me asleep I have had a most rare vision I have had a dream past the wit of man to say what dream it was Man is but an ass if he go about to expound this dream Methought I was there is no man can tell what Methought I was and methought I had but man is but a patch'd fool if he will offer to say what methought I had The eye of man hath not heard the ear of man hath not seen man's hand is not able to taste his tongue to conceive nor his heart to report what my dream was I will get Peter Quince to write a ballad of this dream It shall be call'd 'Bottom's Dream' because it hath no bottom and I will sing it in the latter end of a play before the Duke Peradventure to make it the more gracious I shall sing it at her deathAthenshouse and Have you sent to Bottom's house Is he come home yetHe cannot be heard of Out of doubt he is transportedIf he come not then the play is marr'd it goes not forward doth itIt is not possible You have not a man in all Athens able to discharge Pyramus but heNo he hath simply the best wit of any handicraft man in AthensYea and the best person too and he is a very paramour for a sweet voiceYou must say 'paragon' A paramour is God bless us A thing of naught Masters the Duke is coming from the temple and there is two or three lords and ladies more married If our sport had gone forward we had all been made menO sweet bully Bottom Thus hath he lost sixpence a day during his life he could not have scaped sixpence a day An the Duke had not given him sixpence a day for playing Pyramus I'll be hanged He would have deserved it sixpence a day in Pyramus or nothing Where are these lads Where are these heartsBottom O most courageous day O most happy hourMasters I am to discourse wonders but ask me not what for if I tell you I am not true Athenian I will tell you everything right as it fell outLet us hear sweet BottomNot a word of me All that I will tell you is that the Duke hath dined Get your apparel together good strings to your beards new ribbons to your pumps meet presently at the palace every man look o'er his part for the short and the long is our play is preferr'd In any case let Thisby have clean linen and let not him that plays the lion pare his nails for they shall hang out for the lion's claws And most dear actors eat no onions nor garlic for we are to utter sweet breath and I do not doubt but to hear them say it is a sweet comedy No more words Away go away
