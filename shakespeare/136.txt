A wood near Athensa at One door and at anotherHow now spirit whither wander you Over hill over dale Thorough bush thorough brier Over park over pale Thorough flood thorough fire I do wander every where Swifter than the moon's sphere And I serve the Fairy Queen To dew her orbs upon the green The cowslips tall her pensioners be In their gold coats spots you see Those be rubies fairy favours In those freckles live their savours I must go seek some dewdrops here And hang a pearl in every cowslip's ear Farewell thou lob of spirits I'll be gone Our Queen and all her elves come here anonThe King doth keep his revels here tonight Take heed the Queen come not within his sight For Oberon is passing fell and wrath Because that she as her attendant hath A lovely boy stolen from an Indian king She never had so sweet a changeling And jealous Oberon would have the child Knight of his train to trace the forests wild But she perforce withholds the loved boy Crowns him with flowers and makes him all her joy And now they never meet in grove or green By fountain clear or spangled starlight sheen But they do square that all their elves for fear Creep into acorn cups and hide them thereEither I mistake your shape and making quite Or else you are that shrewd and knavish sprite Call'd Robin Goodfellow Are not you he That frights the maidens of the villagery Skim milk and sometimes labour in the quern And bootless make the breathless housewife churn And sometime make the drink to bear no barm Mislead nightwanderers laughing at their harm Those that Hobgoblin call you and sweet Puck You do their work and they shall have good luck Are not you heThou speakest aright I am that merry wanderer of the night I jest to Oberon and make him smile When I a fat and beanfed horse beguile Neighing in likeness of a filly foal And sometime lurk I in a gossip's bowl In very likeness of a roasted crab And when she drinks against her lips I bob And on her withered dewlap pour the ale The wisest aunt telling the saddest tale Sometime for threefoot stool mistaketh me Then slip I from her bum down topples she And 'tailor' cries and falls into a cough And then the whole quire hold their hips and laugh And waxen in their mirth and neeze and swear A merrier hour was never wasted there But room fairy here comes OberonAnd here my mistress Would that he were gone at one door with hisandat another with hersIll met by moonlight proud TitaniaWhat jealous Oberon Fairies skip hence I have forsworn his bed and companyTarry rash wanton am not I thy lordThen I must be thy lady but I know When thou hast stolen away from fairy land And in the shape of Corin sat all day Playing on pipes of corn and versing love To amorous Phillida Why art thou here Come from the farthest steep of India But that forsooth the bouncing Amazon Your buskin'd mistress and your warrior love To Theseus must be wedded and you come To give their bed joy and prosperityHow canst thou thus for shame Titania Glance at my credit with Hippolyta Knowing I know thy love to Theseus Didst not thou lead him through the glimmering night From Perigouna whom he ravished And make him with fair Aegles break his faith With Ariadne and AntiopaThese are the forgeries of jealousy And never since the middle summer's spring Met we on hill in dale forest or mead By paved fountain or by rushy brook Or in the beached margent of the sea To dance our ringlets to the whistling wind But with thy brawls thou hast disturb'd our sport Therefore the winds piping to us in vain As in revenge have suck'd up from the sea Contagious fogs which falling in the land Hath every pelting river made so proud That they have overborne their continents The ox hath therefore stretch'd his yoke in vain The ploughman lost his sweat and the green corn Hath rotted ere his youth attain'd a beard The fold stands empty in the drowned field And crows are fatted with the murrion flock The nine men's morris is fill'd up with mud And the quaint mazes in the wanton green For lack of tread are undistinguishable The human mortals want their winter here No night is now with hymn or carol blest Therefore the moon the governess of floods Pale in her anger washes all the air That rheumatic diseases do abound And thorough this distemperature we see The seasons alter hoaryheaded frosts Fall in the fresh lap of the crimson rose And on old Hiems' thin and icy crown An odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds Is as in mockery set The spring the summer The childing autumn angry winter change Their wonted liveries and the mazed world By their increase now knows not which is which And this same progeny of evils comes From our debate from our dissension We are their parents and originalDo you amend it then it lies in you Why should Titania cross her Oberon I do but beg a little changeling boy To be my henchmanSet your heart at rest The fairy land buys not the child of me His mother was a vot'ress of my order And in the spiced Indian air by night Full often hath she gossip'd by my side And sat with me on Neptune's yellow sands Marking th' embarked traders on the flood When we have laugh'd to see the sails conceive And grow bigbellied with the wanton wind Which she with pretty and with swimming gait Following her womb then rich with my young squire Would imitate and sail upon the land To fetch me trifles and return again As from a voyage rich with merchandise But she being mortal of that boy did die And for her sake do I rear up her boy And for her sake I will not part with himHow long within this wood intend you stayPerchance till after Theseus' weddingday If you will patiently dance in our round And see our moonlight revels go with us If not shun me and I will spare your hauntsGive me that boy and I will go with theeNot for thy fairy kingdom Fairies away We shall chide downright if I longer stay with her trainWell go thy way thou shalt not from this grove Till I torment thee for this injury My gentle Puck come hither Thou rememb'rest Since once I sat upon a promontory And heard a mermaid on a dolphin's back Uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath That the rude sea grew civil at her song And certain stars shot madly from their spheres To hear the seamaid's musicI rememberThat very time I saw but thou couldst not Flying between the cold moon and the earth Cupid all arm'd a certain aim he took At a fair vestal throned by the west And loos'd his loveshaft smartly from his bow As it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts But I might see young Cupid's fiery shaft Quench'd in the chaste beams of the wat'ry moon And the imperial vot'ress passed on In maiden meditation fancyfree Yet mark'd I where the bolt of Cupid fell It fell upon a little western flower Before milkwhite now purple with love's wound And maidens call it Loveinidleness Fetch me that flow'r the herb I showed thee once The juice of it on sleeping eyelids laid Will make or man or woman madly dote Upon the next live creature that it sees Fetch me this herb and be thou here again Ere the leviathan can swim a leagueI'll put a girdle round about the earth In forty minutes Having once this juice I'll watch Titania when she is asleep And drop the liquor of it in her eyes The next thing then she waking looks upon Be it on lion bear or wolf or bull On meddling monkey or on busy ape She shall pursue it with the soul of love And ere I take this charm from off her sight As I can take it with another herb I'll make her render up her page to me But who comes here I am invisible And I will overhear their conferencefollowing himI love thee not therefore pursue me not Where is Lysander and fair Hermia The one I'll slay the other slayeth me Thou told'st me they were stol'n unto this wood And here am I and wood within this wood Because I cannot meet my Hermia Hence get thee gone and follow me no moreYou draw me you hardhearted adamant But yet you draw not iron for my heart Is true as steel Leave you your power to draw And I shall have no power to follow youDo I entice you Do I speak you fair Or rather do I not in plainest truth Tell you I do not nor I cannot love youAnd even for that do I love you the more I am your spaniel and Demetrius The more you beat me I will fawn on you Use me but as your spaniel spurn me strike me Neglect me lose me only give me leave Unworthy as I am to follow you What worser place can I beg in your love And yet a place of high respect with me Than to be used as you use your dogTempt not too much the hatred of my spirit For I am sick when I do look on theeAnd I am sick when I look not on youYou do impeach your modesty too much To leave the city and commit yourself Into the hands of one that loves you not To trust the opportunity of night And the ill counsel of a desert place With the rich worth of your virginityYour virtue is my privilege for that It is not night when I do see your face Therefore I think I am not in the night Nor doth this wood lack worlds of company For you in my respect are all the world Then how can it be said I am alone When all the world is here to look on meI'll run from thee and hide me in the brakes And leave thee to the mercy of wild beastsThe wildest hath not such a heart as you Run when you will the story shall be chang'd Apollo flies and Daphne holds the chase The dove pursues the griffin the mild hind Makes speed to catch the tiger bootless speed When cowardice pursues and valour fliesI will not stay thy questions let me go Or if thou follow me do not believe But I shall do thee mischief in the woodAy in the temple in the town the field You do me mischief Fie Demetrius Your wrongs do set a scandal on my sex We cannot fight for love as men may do We should be woo'd and were not made to woo I'll follow thee and make a heaven of hell To die upon the hand I love so wellFare thee well nymph ere he do leave this grove Thou shalt fly him and he shall seek thy love ReHast thou the flower there Welcome wandererAy there it isI pray thee give it me I know a bank where the wild thyme blows Where oxlips and the nodding violet grows Quite overcanopied with luscious woodbine With sweet muskroses and with eglantine There sleeps Titania sometime of the night Lull'd in these flowers with dances and delight And there the snake throws her enamell'd skin Weed wide enough to wrap a fairy in And with the juice of this I'll streak her eyes And make her full of hateful fantasies Take thou some of it and seek through this grove A sweet Athenian lady is in love With a disdainful youth anoint his eyes But do it when the next thing he espies May be the lady Thou shalt know the man By the Athenian garments he hath on Effect it with some care that he may prove More fond on her than she upon her love And look thou meet me ere the first cock crowFear not my lord your servant shall do soAnother part of the wood with her trainCome now a roundel and a fairy song Then for the third part of a minute hence Some to kill cankers in the muskrose buds Some war with reremice for their leathern wings To make my small elves coats and some keep back The clamorous owl that nightly hoots and wonders At our quaint spirits Sing me now asleep Then to your offices and let me rest The SingYou spotted snakes with double tongueThorny hedgehogs be not seenNewts and blindworms do no wrongCome not near our fairy Queen Philomel with melodySing in our sweet lullabyLulla lulla lullaby lulla lulla lullabyNever harmNor spell nor charmCome our lovely lady nighSo good night with lullaby Weaving spiders come not hereHence you longlegg'd spinners henceBeetles black approach not nearWorm nor snail do no offence Philomel with melody etc SleepsHence away now all is wellOne aloof stand sentinel and squeezes the flower oneyelidsWhat thou seest when thou dost wake Do it for thy truelove take Love and languish for his sake Be it ounce or cat or bear Pard or boar with bristled hair In thy eye that shall appear When thou wak'st it is thy dear Wake when some vile thing is near and Fair love you faint with wand'ring in the wood And to speak troth I have forgot our way We'll rest us Hermia if you think it good And tarry for the comfort of the dayBe it so Lysander find you out a bed For I upon this bank will rest my headOne turf shall serve as pillow for us both One heart one bed two bosoms and one trothNay good Lysander for my sake my dear Lie further off yet do not lie so nearO take the sense sweet of my innocence Love takes the meaning in love's conference I mean that my heart unto yours is knit So that but one heart we can make of it Two bosoms interchained with an oath So then two bosoms and a single troth Then by your side no bedroom me deny For lying so Hermia I do not lieLysander riddles very prettily Now much beshrew my manners and my pride If Hermia meant to say Lysander lied But gentle friend for love and courtesy Lie further off in human modesty Such separation as may well be said Becomes a virtuous bachelor and a maid So far be distant and good night sweet friend Thy love ne'er alter till thy sweet life endAmen amen to that fair prayer say I And then end life when I end loyalty Here is my bed sleep give thee all his restWith half that wish the wisher's eyes be press'd They sleep Through the forest have I goneBut Athenian found I noneOn whose eyes I might approveThis flower's force in stirring loveNight and silence Who is hereWeeds of Athens he doth wearThis is he my master saidDespised the Athenian maidAnd here the maiden sleeping soundOn the dank and dirty groundPretty soul she durst not lieNear this lacklove this killcourtesyChurl upon thy eyes I throwAll the power this charm doth oweWhen thou wak'st let love forbidSleep his seat on thy eyelidSo awake when I am goneFor I must now to Oberon andrunningStay though thou kill me sweet DemetriusI charge thee hence and do not haunt me thusO wilt thou darkling leave me Do not soStay on thy peril I alone will goO I am out of breath in this fond chase The more my prayer the lesser is my grace Happy is Hermia wheresoe'er she lies For she hath blessed and attractive eyes How came her eyes so bright Not with salt tears If so my eyes are oft'ner wash'd than hers No no I am as ugly as a bear For beasts that meet me run away for fear Therefore no marvel though Demetrius Do as a monster fly my presence thus What wicked and dissembling glass of mine Made me compare with Hermia's sphery eyne But who is here Lysander on the ground Dead or asleep I see no blood no wound Lysander if you live good sir awakeWaking And run through fire I will for thy sweet sake Transparent Helena Nature shows art That through thy bosom makes me see thy heart Where is Demetrius O how fit a word Is that vile name to perish on my swordDo not say so Lysander say not so What though he love your Hermia Lord what though Yet Hermia still loves you then be contentContent with Hermia No I do repent The tedious minutes I with her have spent Not Hermia but Helena I love Who will not change a raven for a dove The will of man is by his reason sway'd And reason says you are the worthier maid Things growing are not ripe until their season So I being young till now ripe not to reason And touching now the point of human skill Reason becomes the marshal to my will And leads me to your eyes where I o'erlook Love's stories written in Love's richest bookWherefore was I to this keen mockery born When at your hands did I deserve this scorn Is't not enough is't not enough young man That I did never no nor never can Deserve a sweet look from Demetrius' eye But you must flout my insufficiency Good troth you do me wrong good sooth you do In such disdainful manner me to woo But fare you well perforce I must confess I thought you lord of more true gentleness O that a lady of one man refus'd Should of another therefore be abus'dShe sees not Hermia Hermia sleep thou there And never mayst thou come Lysander near For as a surfeit of the sweetest things The deepest loathing to the stomach brings Or as the heresies that men do leave Are hated most of those they did deceive So thou my surfeit and my heresy Of all be hated but the most of me And all my powers address your love and might To honour Helen and to be her knightStarting Help me Lysander help me do thy best To pluck this crawling serpent from my breast Ay me for pity What a dream was here Lysander look how I do quake with fear Methought a serpent eat my heart away And you sat smiling at his cruel prey Lysander What remov'd Lysander lord What out of hearing gone No sound no word Alack where are you Speak an if you hear Speak of all loves I swoon almost with fear No Then I well perceive you are not nigh Either death or you I'll find immediately
