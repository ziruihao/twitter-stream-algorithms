A hall in thepalacethethe Merchant of Syracuse and other Proceed Solinus to procure my fall And by the doom of death end woes and allMerchant of Syracuse plead no more I am not partial to infringe our laws The enmity and discord which of late Sprung from the rancorous outrage of your duke To merchants our welldealing countrymen Who wanting guilders to redeem their lives Have seal'd his rigorous statutes with their bloods Excludes all pity from our threat'ning looks For since the mortal and intestine jars 'Twixt thy seditious countrymen and us It hath in solemn synods been decreed Both by the Syracusians and ourselves To admit no traffic to our adverse towns Nay more if any born at Ephesus Be seen at any Syracusian marts and fairs Again if any Syracusian born Come to the bay of Ephesushe dies His goods confiscate to the Duke's dispose Unless a thousand marks be levied To quit the penalty and to ransom him Thy substance valued at the highest rate Cannot amount unto a hundred marks Therefore by law thou art condemn'd to dieYet this my comfort when your words are done My woes end likewise with the evening sunWell Syracusian say in brief the cause Why thou departed'st from thy native home And for what cause thou cam'st to EphesusA heavier task could not have been impos'd Than I to speak my griefs unspeakable Yet that the world may witness that my end Was wrought by nature not by vile offence I'll utter what my sorrow gives me leave In Syracuse was I born and wed Unto a woman happy but for me And by me had not our hap been bad With her I liv'd in joy our wealth increas'd By prosperous voyages I often made To Epidamnum till my factor's death And the great care of goods at random left Drew me from kind embracements of my spouse From whom my absence was not six months old Before herself almost at fainting under The pleasing punishment that women bear Had made provision for her following me And soon and safe arrived where I was There had she not been long but she became A joyful mother of two goodly sons And which was strange the one so like the other As could not be disdnguish'd but by names That very hour and in the selfsame inn A mean woman was delivered Of such a burden male twins both alike Those for their parents were exceeding poor I bought and brought up to attend my sons My wife not meanly proud of two such boys Made daily motions for our home return Unwilling I agreed Alas too soon We came aboard A league from Epidamnum had we sail'd Before the alwayswindobeying deep Gave any tragic instance of our harm But longer did we not retain much hope For what obscured light the heavens did grant Did but convey unto our fearful minds A doubtful warrant of immediate death Which though myself would gladly have embrac'd Yet the incessant weepings of my wife Weeping before for what she saw must come And piteous plainings of the pretty babes That mourn'd for fashion ignorant what to fear Forc'd me to seek delays for them and me And this it was for other means was none The sailors sought for safety by our boat And left the ship then sinkingripe to us My wife more careful for the latterborn Had fast'ned him unto a small spare mast Such as seafaring men provide for storms To him one of the other twins was bound Whilst I had been like heedful of the other The children thus dispos'd my wife and I Fixing our eyes on whom our care was fix'd Fast'ned ourselves at either end the mast And floating straight obedient to the stream Was carried towards Corinth as we thought At length the sun gazing upon the earth Dispers'd those vapours that offended us And by the benefit of his wished light The seas wax'd calm and we discovered Two ships from far making amain to us Of Corinth that of Epidaurus this But ere they cameO let me say no more Gather the sequel by that went beforeNay forward old man do not break off so For we may pity though not pardon theeO had the gods done so I had not now Worthily term'd them merciless to us For ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues We were encount'red by a mighty rock Which being violently borne upon Our helpful ship was splitted in the midst So that in this unjust divorce of us Fortune had left to both of us alike What to delight in what to sorrow for Her part poor soul seeming as burdened With lesser weight but not with lesser woe Was carried with more speed before the wind And in our sight they three were taken up By fishermen of Corinth as we thought At length another ship had seiz'd on us And knowing whom it was their hap to save Gave healthful welcome to their shipwreck'd guests And would have reft the fishers of their prey Had not their bark been very slow of sail And therefore homeward did they bend their course Thus have you heard me sever'd from my bliss That by misfortunes was my life prolong'd To tell sad stories of my own mishapsAnd for the sake of them thou sorrowest for Do me the favour to dilate at full What have befall'n of them and thee till nowMy youngest boy and yet my eldest care At eighteen years became inquisitive After his brother and importun'd me That his attendantso his case was like Reft of his brother but retain'd his name Might bear him company in the quest of him Whom whilst I laboured of a love to see I hazarded the loss of whom I lov'd Five summers have I spent in farthest Greece Roaming clean through the bounds of Asia And coasting homeward came to Ephesus Hopeless to find yet loath to leave unsought Or that or any place that harbours men But here must end the story of my life And happy were I in my timely death Could all my travels warrant me they liveHapless Aegeon whom the fates have mark'd To bear the extremity of dire mishap Now trust me were it not against our laws Against my crown my oath my dignity Which princes would they may not disannul My soul should sue as advocate for thee But though thou art adjudged to the death And passed sentence may not be recall'd But to our honour's great disparagement Yet will I favour thee in what I can Therefore merchant I'll limit thee this day To seek thy help by beneficial hap Try all the friends thou hast in Ephesus Beg thou or borrow to make up the sum And live if no then thou art doom'd to die Gaoler take him to thy custodyI will my lordHopeless and helpless doth Aegeon wend But to procrastinate his lifeless end The martand Therefore give out you are of Epidamnum Lest that your goods too soon be confiscate This very day a Syracusian merchant Is apprehended for arrival here And not being able to buy out his life According to the statute of the town Dies ere the weary sun set in the west There is your money that I had to keep Go bear it to the Centaur where we host And stay there Dromio till I come to thee Within this hour it will be dinnertime Till that I'll view the manners of the town Peruse the traders gaze upon the buildings And then return and sleep within mine inn For with long travel I am stiff and weary Get thee away Many a man would take you at your word And go indeed having so good a meanA trusty villain sir that very oft When I am dull with care and melancholy Lightens my humour with his

now How chance thou art return'd so soon Return'd so soon rather approach'd too late The capon burns the pig falls from the spit The clock hath strucken twelve upon the bell My mistress made it one

yours That stands on tricks when I am undispos'd Where is the thousand marks thou hadst of me I have some marks of yours upon my pate Some of my mistress' marks upon my shoulders But not a thousand

cozenage As nimble jugglers that deceive the eye Darkworking sorcerers that change the mind Soulkilling witches that deform the body Disguised cheaters prating mountebanks And many suchlike liberties of sin If it prove so I will be gone the sooner I'll to the Centaur to go seek this slave I greatly fear my money is not safe
