run scorn running with thy heels' Well the most courageous fiend bids me pack 'Via' says the fiend 'away' says the fiend 'For the heavens rouse up a brave mind' says the fiend 'and run' Well my conscience hanging about the neck of my heart says very wisely to me 'My honest friend Launcelot being an honest man's son' or rather 'an honest woman's son' for indeed my father did something smack something grow to he had a kind of taste well my conscience says 'Launcelot budge not' 'Budge' says the fiend 'Budge not' says my conscience 'Conscience' say I you counsel well' 'Fiend' say I 'you counsel well' To be rul'd by my conscience I should stay with the Jew my master who God bless the mark is a kind of devil and to run away from the Jew I should be ruled by the fiend who saving your reverence is the devil himself Certainly the Jew is the very devil incarnation and in my conscience my conscience is but a kind of hard conscience to offer to counsel me to stay with the Jew The fiend gives the more friendly counsel I will run fiend my heels are at your commandment I will runwith a basketMaster young man you I pray you which is the way to master Jew's AsideO heavens This is my

hour is almost pastAnd it is marvel he outdwells his hour For lovers ever run before the clockO ten times faster Venus' pigeons fly To seal love's bonds new made than they are wont To keep obliged faith unforfeitedThat ever holds who riseth from a feast With that keen appetite that he sits down Where is the horse that doth untread again His tedious measures with the unbated fire That he did pace them first All things that are Are with more spirit chased than enjoyed How like a younker or a prodigal The scarfed bark puts from her native bay Hugg'd and embraced by the strumpet wind How like the prodigal doth she return With overweather'd ribs and ragged sails Lean rent and beggar'd by the strumpet wind Here comes Lorenzo more of this hereafterSweet friends your patience for my long abode Not I but my affairs have made you wait When you shall please to play the thieves for wives I'll watch as long for you then Approach Here dwells my father Jew Ho who's withinabove in boy's

Lorenzo whether I am yoursHeaven and thy thoughts are witness that thou artHere catch this casket it is worth the pains I am glad 'tis night you do not look on me For I am much asham'd of my exchange But love is blind and lovers cannot see The pretty follies that themselves commit For if they could Cupid himself would blush To see me thus transformed to a boyDescend for you must be my torchbearerWhat must I hold a candle to my shames They in themselves good sooth are too too light Why 'tis an office of discovery love And I should be obscur'dSo are you sweet Even in the lovely

rightThe one of them contains my picture Prince If you choose that then I am yours withal Some god direct my judgment Let me see I will survey th' inscriptions back again What says this leaden casket 'Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath' Must give for what For lead Hazard for lead This casket threatens men that hazard all Do it in hope of fair advantages A golden mind stoops not to shows of dross I'll then nor give nor hazard aught for lead What says the silver with her virgin hue 'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves' As much as he deserves Pause there Morocco And weigh thy value with an even hand If thou beest rated by thy estimation Thou dost deserve enough and yet enough May not extend so far as to the lady And yet to be afeard of my deserving Were but a weak disabling of myself As much as I deserve Why that's the lady I do in birth deserve her and in fortunes In graces and in qualities of breeding But more than these in love I do deserve What if I stray'd no farther but chose here Let's see once more this saying grav'd in gold 'Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire' Why that's the lady All the world desires her From the four corners of the earth they come To kiss this shrine this mortalbreathing saint The Hyrcanian deserts and the vasty wilds Of wide Arabia are as throughfares now For princes to come view fair Portia The watery kingdom whose ambitious head Spits in the face of heaven is no bar To stop the foreign spirits but they come As o'er a brook to see fair Portia One of these three contains her heavenly picture Is't

went with him to search Bassanio's shipHe came too late the ship was under sail But there the Duke was given to understand That in a gondola were seen together Lorenzo and his amorous Jessica Besides Antonio certified the Duke They were not with Bassanio in his shipI never heard a passion so confus'd So strange outrageous and so variable As the dog Jew did utter in the streets 'My daughter O my ducats O my daughter Fled with a Christian O my Christian ducats Justice the law My ducats and my daughter A sealed bag two sealed bags of ducats Of double ducats stol'n from me by my daughter And jewels two stones two rich and precious stones Stol'n by my daughter Justice Find the girl She hath the stones upon her and the ducats'Why all the boys in Venice follow him Crying his stones his

business for my sake Bassanio But stay the very riping of the time And for the Jew's bond which he hath of me Let it notin your mind of love Be merry and employ your chiefest thoughts To courtship and

men desire' What many men desire that 'many' may be meant By the fool multitude that choose by show Not learning more than the fond eye doth teach Which pries not to th' interior but like the martlet Builds in the weather on the outward wall Even in the force and road of casualty I will not choose what many men desire Because I will not jump with common spirits And rank me with the barbarous multitudes Why then to thee thou silver treasurehouse Tell me once more what title thou dost bear 'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves' And well said too for who shall go about To cozen fortune and be honourable Without the stamp of merit Let none presume To wear an undeserved dignity O that estates degrees and offices Were not deriv'd corruptly and that clear honour Were purchas'd by the merit of the wearer How many then should cover that stand bare How many be commanded that command How much low peasantry would then be gleaned From the true seed of honour and how much honour
