paidAnd so am I my name is Walter Whitmore How now Why start'st thou What doth death affrightThy name affrights me in whose sound is death A cunning man did calculate my birth And told me that by water I should die Yet let not this make thee be bloodyminded Thy name is Gualtier being rightly soundedGualtier or Walter which it is I care not Never yet did base dishonour blur our name But with our sword we wip'd away the blot Therefore when merchantlike I sell revenge Broke be my sword my arms torn and defac'd And I proclaim'd a coward through the worldStay Whitmore for thy prisoner is a

footcloth mule And thought thee happy when I shook my head How often hast thou waited at my cup Fed from my trencher kneel'd down at the board When I have feasted with Queen Margaret Remember it and let it make thee crestfall'n Ay and allay thus thy abortive pride How in our voidinglobby hast thou stood And duly waited for my coming forth This hand of mine hath writ in thy behalf And therefore

mouth For swallowing the treasure of the realm Thy lips that kiss'd the Queen shall sweep the ground And thou that smil'dst at good Duke Humphrey's death Against the senseless winds shalt grin in vain Who in contempt shall hiss at thee again And wedded be thou to the hags of hell For daring to affy a mighty lord Unto the daughter of a worthless king Having neither subject wealth nor diadem By devilish policy art thou grown great And like ambitious Sylla overgorg'd With gobbets of thy mother's bleeding heart By thee Anjou and Maine were sold to France The false revolting Normans thorough thee Disdain to call us lord and Picardy Hath slain their governors surpris'd our forts And sent the ragged soldiers wounded home The princely Warwick and the Nevils all Whose dreadful swords were

wives and daughters before your faces For me I will make shift for one and so God's curse light upon you allWe'll follow Cade we'll follow CadeIs Cade the son of Henry the Fifth That thus you do exclaim you'll go with him Will he conduct you through the heart of France And make the meanest of you earls and dukes Alas he hath no home no place to fly to Nor knows he how to live but by the spoil Unless by robbing of your friends and us Were't not a shame that whilst you live at jar The fearful French whom you late vanquished Should make a start o'er seas and vanquish you Methinks already in this civil broil I see them lording it in London streets Crying 'Villiago' unto all they meet Better ten thousand baseborn Cades miscarry Than you should stoop unto a Frenchman's mercy To France to France and get what you have lost Spare England for it is your native coast Henry hath money you are strong and manly God on our side doubt not of victoryA Clifford a Clifford We'll follow the King

together to surprise me My sword make way for me for here is no staying In despite of the devils and hell have through the very middest of you and heavens and honour be witness that no want of resolution in me but only my followers' base and ignominious treasons makes me betake me to my heelsWhat is he fled Go some and follow him And he that brings his head unto the King Shall have a thousand crowns for his reward some of them Follow me soldiers we'll devise a mean To reconcile you all unto the King Killing worth Castle Sound trumpetsandon the terraceWas ever king that joy'd an

be a subject and old Health and glad tidings to your MajestyWhy Buckingham is the traitor Cade surpris'd Or is he but retir'd to make him strong below multitudes with halters about their necksHe is fled my lord and all his powers do yield And humbly thus with halters on their necks Expect your Highness' doom of life or deathThen heaven set ope thy everlasting gates To tain my vows of thanks and praise Soldiers this day have you redeem'd your lives And show'd how well you love your Prince and country Continue still in this so good a mind And Henry though he be infortunate Assure yourselves will never be unkind And so with thanks and pardon to you all I do dismiss you to your several countriesGod save the King God save the King a Please it your Grace to be advertised The Duke of York is newly come from Ireland And with a puissant and a mighty power Of gallowglasses and stout kerns Is marching hitherward in proud array And still proclaimeth as he comes along His arms are only to remove from thee The Duke of Somerset whom he terms a traitorThus stands my state 'twixt Cade and York distress'd Like to a ship that having scap'd a tempest Is straightway calm'd and boarded with a pirate But now is Cade driven back his men dispers'd And now is York in arms to second him I pray thee Buckingham go and meet him And ask him what's the reason of these arms Tell him I'll send Duke Edmund to the Tower And Somerset we will commit thee thither Until his army be dismiss'd from himMy lord I'll yield myself to prison willingly Or unto death to do my country goodIn any case be not too rough in terms For he is fierce and cannot brook hard languageI will my lord and doubt not so to deal As all things shall redound unto your goodCome wife let's in and learn to govern better For yet may England curse my wretched reign Flourish Kent Iden's gardenFie on ambitions Fie on myself that have a sword and yet am ready to famish These five days have I hid me in these woods and durst not peep out for all the country is laid for me but now am I so hungry that if I might have a lease of my life for a thousand years I could stay no longer Wherefore on a brick wall have I climb'd into this garden to see if I can eat grass or pick a sallet another while which is not amiss to cool a man's stomach this hot weather And I think this word 'sallet' was born to do me good for many a time but for a sallet my brainpain had been cleft with a brown bill and many a time when I have been dry and bravely marching it hath serv'd me instead of a quartpot to drink in and now the word 'sallet' must serve me to feed on Lord who would live turmoiled in the court And may enjoy such quiet walks as these This small inheritance my father left me Contenteth me and worth a monarchy I seek not to wax great by others' waning Or gather wealth I care not with what envy Sufficeth that I have maintains my state And sends the poor well pleased from my gateHere's the lord of the soil come to seize me for a stray for ing his feesimple without leave Ah villain thou wilt betray me and get a thousand crowns of the King by carrying my head to him but I'll make thee eat iron like an ostrich and swallow my sword like a great pin ere thou and I partWhy rude companion whatsoe'er thou be I know thee not why then should I betray thee Is't not enough to break into my garden And like a thief to come to rob my grounds Climbing my walls in spite of me the owner But thou wilt brave me with these saucy termsBrave thee Ay by the best blood that ever was broach'd and beard thee too Look on me well I have eat no meat these five days yet come thou and thy five men and if I do not leave you all as dead as a doornail I pray God I may never eat grass moreNay it shall ne'er be said while England stands That Alexander Iden an esquire of Kent Took odds to combat a poor famish'd man Oppose thy steadfastgazing eyes to mine See if thou canst outface me with thy looks Set limb to limb and thou art far the lesser Thy hand is but a finger to my fist Thy leg a stick compared with this truncheon My foot shall fight with all the strength thou hast And if mine arm be heaved in the air Thy grave is digg'd already in the earth As for words whose greatness answers words Let this my sword report what speech forbearsBy my valour the most complete champion that ever I heard Steel if thou turn the edge or cut not out the burly bon'd clown in chines of beef ere thou sleep in thy sheath I beseech God on my knees thou mayst be turn'd to hobnails Here they fight falls O I am slain famine and no other hath slain me Let ten thousand devils come against me and give me but the ten meals I have lost and I'd defy them all Wither garden and be henceforth a burying place to all that do dwell in this house because the unconquered soul of Cade is fledIs't Cade that I have slain that monstrous traitor Sword I will hallow thee for this thy deed And hang thee o'er my tomb when I am dead Ne'er shall this blood be wiped from thy point But thou shalt wear it as a herald's coat To emblaze the honour that thy master gotIden farewell and be proud of thy victory Tell Kent from me she hath lost her best man and exhort all the world to be cowards for I that never feared any am vanquished by famine not by valourDiesHow much thou wrong'st me heaven be my judge Die damned wretch the curse of her that bare thee And as I thrust thy body in with my sword So wish I I might thrust thy soul to hell Hence will I drag thee headlong by the heels Unto a dunghill which shall be thy grave And there cut off thy most ungracious head Which I will bear in triumph to the King Leaving thy trunk for crows to feed upon
