 SceneElsinore A room in the CastleKing Queen Polonius Ophelia Rosencrantz Guildenstern and Lords King And can you by no drift of circumstance Get from him why he puts on this confusion Grating so harshly all his days of quiet With turbulent and dangerous lunacy Ros He does confess he feels himself distracted But from what cause he will by no means speak Guil Nor do we find him forward to be sounded But with a crafty madness keeps aloof When we would bring him on to some confession Of his true state Queen Did he receive you well Ros Most like a gentleman Guil But with much forcing of his disposition Ros Niggard of question but of our demands Most free in his reply Queen Did you assay him To any pastime Ros Madam it so fell out that certain players We o'erraught on the way Of these we told him And there did seem in him a kind of joy To hear of it They are here about the court And as I think they have already order This night to play before him Pol 'Tis most true And he beseech'd me to entreat your Majesties To hear and see the matter King With all my heart and it doth much content me To hear him so inclin'd Good gentlemen give him a further edge And drive his purpose on to these delights Ros We shall my lordRosencrantz and Guildenstern King Sweet Gertrude leave us too For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither That he as 'twere by accident may here Affront Ophelia Her father and myself lawful espials Will so bestow ourselves that seeing unseen We may of their encounter frankly judge And gather by him as he is behav'd If't be th' affliction of his love or no That thus he suffers for Queen I shall obey you And for your part Ophelia I do wish That your good beauties be the happy cause Of Hamlet's wildness So shall I hope your virtues Will bring him to his wonted way again To both your honours Oph Madam I wish it may Queen Pol Ophelia walk you here Gracious so please you We will bestow ourselves To Ophelia Read on this book That show of such an exercise may colour Your loneliness We are oft to blame in this 'Tis too much prov'd that with devotion's visage And pious action we do sugar o'er The Devil himself King aside O 'tis too true How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience The harlot's cheek beautied with plast'ring art Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it Than is my deed to my most painted word O heavy burthen Pol I hear him coming Let's withdraw my lordKing and Polonius Hamlet Ham To be or not to be that is the question Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune Or to take arms against a sea of troubles And by opposing end them To die to sleep No more and by a sleep to say we end The heartache and the thousand natural shocks That flesh is heir to 'Tis a consummation Devoutly to be wish'd To die to sleep To sleep perchance to dream ay there's the rub For in that sleep of death what dreams may come When we have shuffled off this mortal coil Must give us pause There's the respect That makes calamity of so long life For who would bear the whips and scorns of time Th' oppressor's wrong the proud man's contumely The pangs of despis'd love the law's delay The insolence of office and the spurns That patient merit of th' unworthy takes When he himself might his quietus make With a bare bodkin Who would these fardels bear To grunt and sweat under a weary life But that the dread of something after death The undiscover'd country from whose bourn No traveller returns puzzles the will And makes us rather bear those ills we have Than fly to others that we know not of Thus conscience does make cowards of us all And thus the native hue of resolution Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought And prises of great pith and moment With this regard their currents turn awry And lose the name of action Soft you now The fair Ophelia Nymph in thy orisons Be all my sins rememb'red Oph Good my lord How does your honour for this many a day Ham I humbly thank you well well well Oph My lord I have remembrances of yours That I have longed long to redeliver I pray you now receive them Ham No not I I never gave you aught Oph My honour'd lord you know right well you did And with them words of so sweet breath compos'd As made the things more rich Their perfume lost Take these again for to the noble mind Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind There my lord Ham Ha ha Are you honest Oph My lord Ham Are you fair Oph What means your lordship Ham That if you be honest and fair your honesty should admit no discourse to your beauty Oph Could beauty my lord have better commerce than with honesty Ham Ay truly for the power of beauty will sooner transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can translate beauty into his likeness This was sometime a paradox but now the time gives it proof I did love you once Oph Indeed my lord you made me believe so Ham You should not have believ'd me for virtue cannot so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it I loved you not Oph I was the more deceived Ham Get thee to a nunnery Why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners I am myself indifferent honest but yet I could accuse me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne me I am very proud revengeful ambitious with more offences at my beck than I have thoughts to put them in imagination to give them shape or time to act them in What should such fellows as I do crawling between earth and heaven We are arrant knaves all believe none of us Go thy ways to a nunnery Where's your father Oph At home my lord Ham Let the doors be shut upon him that he may play the fool nowhere but in's own house Farewell Oph O help him you sweet heavens Ham If thou dost marry I'll give thee this plague for thy dowry be thou as chaste as ice as pure as snow thou shalt not escape calumny Get thee to a nunnery Go farewell Or if thou wilt needs marry marry a fool for wise men know well enough what monsters you make of them To a nunnery go and quickly too Farewell Oph O heavenly powers restore him Ham I have heard of your paintings too well enough God hath given you one face and you make yourselves another You jig you amble and you lisp you nickname God's creatures and make your wantonness your ignorance Go to I'll no more on't it hath made me mad I say we will have no moe marriages Those that are married already all but one shall live the rest shall keep as they are To a nunnery go Oph O what a noble mind is here o'erthrown The courtier's scholar's soldier's eye tongue sword Th' expectancy and rose of the fair state The glass of fashion and the mould of form Th' observ'd of all observers quite quite down And I of ladies most deject and wretched That suck'd the honey of his music vows Now see that noble and most sovereign reason Like sweet bells jangled out of tune and harsh That unmatch'd form and feature of blown youth Blasted with ecstasy O woe is me T' have seen what I have seen see what I see King and Polonius King Love his affections do not that way tend Nor what he spake though it lack'd form a little Was not like madness There's something in his soul O'er which his melancholy sits on brood And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose Will be some danger which for to prevent I have in quick determination Thus set it down he shall with speed to England For the demand of our neglected tribute Haply the seas and countries different With variable objects shall expel This somethingsettled matter in his heart Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus From fashion of himself What think you on't Pol It shall do well But yet do I believe The origin and commencement of his grief Sprung from neglected love How now Ophelia You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said We heard it all My lord do as you please But if you hold it fit after the play Let his queen mother all alone entreat him To show his grief Let her be round with him And I'll be plac'd so please you in the ear Of all their conference If she find him not To England send him or confine him where Your wisdom best shall think King It shall be so Madness in great ones must not unwatch'd go SceneElsinore hall in the CastleHamlet and three of the Players Ham Speak the speech I pray you as I pronounc'd it to you trippingly on the tongue But if you mouth it as many of our players do I had as live the town crier spoke my lines Nor do not saw the air too much with your hand thus but use all gently for in the very torrent tempest and as I may say whirlwind of your passion you must acquire and beget a temperance that may give it smoothness O it offends me to the soul to hear a robustious periwigpated fellow tear a passion to tatters to very rags to split the cars of the groundlings who for the most part are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb shows and noise I would have such a fellow whipp'd for o'erdoing Termagant It outherods Herod Pray you avoid it Player I warrant your honour Ham Be not too tame neither but let your own discretion be your tutor Suit the action to the word the word to the action with this special observance that you o'erstep not the modesty of nature for anything so overdone is from the purpose of playing whose end both at the first and now was and is to hold as 'twere the mirror up to nature to show Virtue her own feature scorn her own image and the very age and body of the time his form and pressure Now this overdone or come tardy off though it make the unskilful laugh cannot but make the judicious grieve the censure of the which one must in your allowance o'erweigh a whole theatre of others O there be players that I have seen play and heard others praise and that highly not to speak it profanely that neither having the accent of Christians nor the gait of Christian pagan nor man have so strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of Nature's journeymen had made men and not made them well they imitated humanity so abominably Player I hope we have reform'd that indifferently with us sir Ham O reform it altogether And let those that play your clowns speak no more than is set down for them For there be of them that will themselves laugh to set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh too though in the mean time some necessary question of the play be then to be considered That's villanous and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it Go make you ready PlayersPolonius Rosencrantz and Guildenstern How now my lord Will the King hear this piece of work Pol And the Queen too and that presently Ham Bid the players make hastePolonius Will you two help to hasten them Both We will my lordthey two Ham What ho HoratioHoratio Hor Here sweet lord at your service Ham Horatio thou art e'en as just a man As e'er my conversation cop'd withal Hor O my dear lord Ham Nay do not think I flatter For what advancement may I hope from thee That no revenue hast but thy good spirits To feed and clothe thee Why should the poor be flatter'd No let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee Where thrift may follow fawning Dost thou hear Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice And could of men distinguish her election Hath scald thee for herself For thou hast been As one in suff'ring all that suffers nothing A man that Fortune's buffets and rewards Hast ta'en with equal thanks and blest are those Whose blood and judgment are so well commingled That they are not a pipe for Fortune's finger To sound what stop she please Give me that man That is not passion's slave and I will wear him In my heart's core ay in my heart of heart As I do thee Something too much of this I There is a play tonight before the King One scene of it comes near the circumstance Which I have told thee of my father's death I prithee when thou seest that act afoot Even with the very comment of thy soul Observe my uncle If his occulted guilt Do not itself unkennel in one speech It is a damned ghost that we have seen And my imaginations are as foul As Vulcan's stithy Give him heedful note For I mine eyes will rivet to his face And after we will both our judgments join In censure of his seeming Hor Well my lord If he

air promisecramm'd You cannot feed capons so King I have nothing with this answer Hamlet These words are not mine Ham No nor mine now To Polonius My lord you play'd once i' th' university you say Pol That did I my lord and was accounted a good actor Ham What did you enact Pol I did enact Julius Caesar I was kill'd i' th' Capitol Brutus kill'd me Ham It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf there Be the players ready Ros Ay my lord They stay upon your patience Queen Come hither my dear Hamlet sit by me Ham No good mother Here's metal more attractive Pol to the King O ho do you mark that Ham Lady shall I lie in your lap Sits down at Ophelia's feet Oph No my lord Ham I mean my head upon your lap Oph Ay my lord Ham Do you think I meant country matters Oph I think nothing my lord Ham That's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs Oph What is my lord Ham Nothing Oph You are merry my lord Ham Who I Oph Ay my lord Ham O God your only jigmaker What should a man do but be merry For look you how cheerfully my mother looks and my father died within 's two hours Oph Nay 'tis twice two months my lord Ham So long Nay then let the devil wear black for I'll have a suit of sables O heavens die two months ago and not forgotten yet Then there's hope a great man's memory may outlive his life half a year But by'r Lady he must build churches then or else shall he suffer not thinking on with the hobbyhorse whose epitaph is 'For O for O the hobbyhorse is forgot'Hautboys play The dumb show sa King and a Queen very lovingly the Queen embracing him and he her She kneels and makes show of protestation unto him He takes her up and declines his head upon her neck He lays him down upon a bank of flowers She seeing him asleep leaves him Anon comes in a fellow takes off his crown kisses it pours poison in the sleeper's ears and leaves him The Queen returns finds the King dead and makes passionate action The Poisoner with some three or four Mutes comes in again seem to condole with her The dead body is carried away The Poisoner wooes the Queen with gifts she seems harsh and unwilling awhile but in the end accepts his love Oph What means this my lord Ham Marry this is miching malhecho it means mischief Oph Belike this show imports the argument of the playPrologue Ham We shall know by this fellow The players cannot keep counsel they'll tell all Oph Will he tell us what this show meant Ham Ay or any show that you'll show him Be not you asham'd to show he'll not shame to tell you what it means Oph You are naught you are naught I'll mark the play Pro For us and for our tragedy Here stooping to your clemency We beg your hearing patientlyHam Is this a prologue or the posy of a ring Oph 'Tis brief my lord Ham As woman's lovetwo Players as King and Queen King Full thirty times hath Phoebus' cart gone round Neptune's salt wash and Tellus' orbed ground And thirty dozed moons with borrowed sheen About the world have times twelve thirties been Since love our hearts and Hymen did our hands Unite comutual in most sacred bands Queen So many journeys may the sun and moon Make us again count o'er ere love be done But woe is me you are so sick of late So far from cheer and from your former state That I distrust you Yet though I distrust Discomfort you my lord it nothing must For women's fear and love holds quantity In neither aught or in extremity Now what my love is proof hath made you know And as my love is siz'd my fear is so Where love is great the littlest doubts are fear Where little fears grow great great love grows there King Faith I must leave thee love and shortly too My operant powers their functions leave to do And thou shalt live in this fair world behind Honour'd belov'd and haply one as kind For husband shalt thou Queen O confound the rest Such love must needs be treason in my breast When second husband let me be accurst None wed the second but who killed the first Ham aside Wormwood wormwood Queen The instances that second marriage move Are base respects of thrift but none of love A second time I kill my husband dead When second husband kisses me in bed King I do believe you think what now you speak But what we do determine oft we break Purpose is but the slave to memory Of violent birth but poor validity Which now like fruit unripe sticks on the tree But fill unshaken when they mellow be Most necessary 'tis that we forget To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt What to ourselves in passion we propose The passion ending doth the purpose lose The violence of either grief or joy Their own enactures with themselves destroy Where joy most revels grief doth most lament Grief joys joy grieves on slender accident This world is not for aye nor 'tis not strange That even our loves should with our fortunes change For 'tis a question left us yet to prove Whether love lead fortune or else fortune love The great man down you mark his favourite flies The poor advanc'd makes friends of enemies And hitherto doth love on fortune tend For who not needs shall never lack a friend And who in want a hollow friend doth try Directly seasons him his enemy But orderly to end where I begun Our wills and fates do so contrary run That our devices still are overthrown Our thoughts are ours their ends none of our own So think thou wilt no second husband wed But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead Queen Nor earth to me give food nor heaven light Sport and repose lock from me day and night To desperation turn my trust and hope An anchor's cheer in prison be my scope Each opposite that blanks the face of joy Meet what I would have well and it destroy Both here and hence pursue me lasting strife If once a widow ever I be wife Ham If she should break it now King 'Tis deeply sworn Sweet leave me here awhile My spirits grow dull and fain I would beguile The tedious day with sleep Queen Sleep rock thy brain He sleeps And never come mischance between us twainHam Madam how like you this play Queen The lady doth protest too much methinks Ham O but she'll keep her word King Have you heard the argument Is there no offence in't Ham No no They do but jest poison in jest no offence i' th' world King What do you call the play Ham 'The Mousetrap' Marry how Tropically This play is the image of a murther done in Vienna Gonzago is the duke's name his wife Baptista You shall see anon 'Tis a knavish piece of work but what o' that Your Majesty and we that have free souls it touches us not Let the gall'd jade winch our withers are unwrung Lucianus This is one Lucianus nephew to the King Oph You are as good as a chorus my lord Ham I could interpret between you and your love if I could see the puppets dallying Oph You are keen my lord you are keen Ham It would cost you a groaning to take off my edge Oph Still better and worse Ham So you must take your husbands Begin murtherer Pox leave thy damnable faces and begin Come the croaking raven doth bellow for revenge Luc Thoughts black hands apt drugs fit

Come some musicRosencrantz and Guildenstern Guil Good my lord vouchsafe me a word with you Ham Sir a whole history Guil The King sir Ham Ay sir what of him Guil Is in his retirement marvellous distemper'd Ham With drink sir Guil No my lord rather with choler Ham Your wisdom should show itself more richer to signify this to the doctor for me to put him to his purgation would perhaps plunge him into far more choler Guil Good my lord put your discourse into some frame and start not so wildly from my affair Ham I am tame sir pronounce Guil The Queen your mother in most great affliction of spirit hath sent me to you Ham You are welcome Guil Nay good my lord this courtesy is not of the right breed If it shall please you to make me a wholesome answer I will do your mother's commandment if

or rather as you say my mother Therefore no more but to the matter My mother you say Ros Then thus she says your behaviour hath struck her into amazement and admiration Ham O wonderful son that can so stonish a mother But is there no sequel at the heels of this mother's admiration Impart Ros She desires to speak with you in her closet ere you go to bed Ham We shall obey were she ten times our mother Have you any further trade with us Ros My lord you once did love me Ham And do still by these pickers and stealers Ros Good my lord what is your cause of distemper You do surely bar the door upon your own liberty if you deny your griefs to your friend Ham Sir I lack advancement Ros How can that be when you have the voice of the King himself for your succession in Denmark Ham Ay sir but 'while the grass grows' the proverb is something musty the Players with recorders O the recorders Let me see one To withdraw with you why do you go about to recover the wind of me as if you would drive me into a toil Guil O my lord if my duty be too bold my love is too unmannerly Ham I do not well understand that Will you play upon this pipe Guil My lord I cannot Ham I pray you Guil Believe me I cannot Ham I do beseech you Guil I know no touch of it my lord Ham It is as easy as lying Govern these ventages with your fingers and thumbs give it breath with your mouth and it will discourse most eloquent music Look you these are the stops Guil But these cannot I command to any utt'rance of harmony I have not the skill Ham Why look you now how unworthy a thing you make of me You would play upon me you would seem to know my stops you would pluck out the heart of my mystery you would sound me from my lowest note to the top of my compass and there is much music excellent voice in this little organ yet cannot you make it speak blood do you think I am easier to be play'd on than a pipe Call me what instrument you will though you can fret me you cannot play upon mePolonius God bless you sir Pol My lord the Queen would speak with you and presently Ham Do you see yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a camel Pol By th' mass and 'tis like a camel indeed Ham Methinks it is like a

'Byandby' is easily said Leave me friendsall but Hamlet 'Tis now the very witching time of night When churchyards yawn and hell itself breathes out Contagion to this world Now could I drink hot blood And do such bitter business as the day Would quake to look on Soft now to my mother O heart lose not thy nature let not ever The soul of Nerothis firm bosom Let me be cruel not unnatural I will speak daggers to her but use none My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites How in my words somever she be shent To give them seals never my soul consent SceneA room in the CastleKing Rosencrantz and Guildenstern King I like him not nor stands it safe with us To let his madness range Therefore prepare you I your commission will forthwith dispatch And he to England shall along with you The terms of our estate may not endure Hazard so near us as doth hourly grow Out of his lunacies Guil We will ourselves provide Most holy and religious fear it is To keep those many many bodies safe That live and feed upon your Majesty Ros The single and peculiar life is bound With all the strength and armour of the mind To keep itself from noyance but much more That spirit upon whose weal depends and rests The lives of many The cesse of majesty Dies not alone but like a gulf doth draw What's near it with it It is a massy wheel Fix'd on the summit of the highest mount To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things Are mortis'd and adjoin'd which when it falls Each small annexment petty consequence Attends the boist'rous ruin Never alone Did the king sigh but with a general groan King Arm you I pray you to th' speedy voyage For we will fetters put upon this fear Which now goes too freefooted Both We will haste us Gentlemen Polonius Pol My lord he's going to his mother's closet Behind the arras I'll convey myself To hear the process I'll warrant she'll tax him home And as you said and wisely was it said 'Tis meet that some more audience than a mother Since nature makes them partial should o'erhear The speech of vantage Fare you well my liege I'll call upon you ere you go to bed And tell you what I know King Thanks dear my lordPolonius O my offence is rank it smells to heaven It hath the primal eldest curse upon't A brother's murther Pray can I not Though inclination be as sharp as will My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent And like a man to double business bound I stand in pause where I shall first begin And both neglect What if this cursed hand Were thicker than itself with brother's blood Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens To wash it white as snow Whereto serves mercy But to confront the visage of offence And what's in prayer but this twofold force To be forestalled ere we come to fall Or pardon'd being down Then I'll look up My fault is past But O what form of prayer Can serve my turn 'Forgive me my foul murther' That cannot be since I am still possess'd Of those effects for which I did the murther My crown mine own ambition and my queen May one be pardon'd and retain th' offence In the corrupted currents of this world Offence's gilded hand may shove by justice And oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself Buys out the law but 'tis not so above There is no shuffling there the action lies In his true nature and we ourselves compell'd Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults To give in evidence What then What rests Try what repentance can What can it not Yet what can it when one cannot repent O wretched state O bosom black as death O limed soul that struggling to be free Art more engag'd Help angels Make assay Bow stubborn knees and heart with strings of steel Be soft as sinews of the newborn babe All may be wellHe kneels Hamlet Ham Now might I do it pat now he is praying And now I'll do't And so he goes to heaven And so am I reveng'd That would be scann'd A villain kills my father and for that I his sole son do this same villain send To heaven Why this is hire and salary not revenge He took my father grossly full of bread With all his crimes broad blown as flush as May And how his audit stands who knows save heaven But in our circumstance and course of thought 'Tis heavy with him and am I then reveng'd To take him in the purging of his soul When he is fit and seasoned for his passage No Up sword and know thou a more horrid hent When he is drunk asleep or in his rage Or in th' incestuous pleasure of his bed At gaming swearing or about some act That has no relish of salvation in't Then trip him that his heels may kick at heaven And that his soul may be as damn'd and black As hell

matter Queen Hamlet thou hast thy father much offended Ham Mother you have my father much offended Queen Come come you answer with an idle tongue Ham Go go you question with a wicked tongue Queen Why how now Hamlet Ham What's the matter now Queen Have you forgot me Ham No by the rood not so You are the Queen your husband's brother's wife And would it were not so you are my mother Queen Nay then I'll set those to you that can speak Ham Come come and sit you down You shall not budge I You go not till I set you up a glass Where you may see the inmost part of you Queen What wilt thou do Thou wilt not murther me Help help ho Pol behind What ho help help help Ham draws How now a rat Dead for a ducat dead Makes a pass through the arras and kills Polonius Pol behind O I am slain Queen O me what hast thou done Ham Nay I know not Is it the King Queen O what a rash and bloody deed is this Ham A bloody deed almost as bad good mother As kill a king and marry with his brother Queen As kill a king Ham Ay lady it was my wordLifts up the arras and sees Polonius Thou wretched rash intruding fool farewell I took thee for thy better Take thy fortune Thou find'st to be too busy is some danger Leave wringing of your hinds Peace sit you down And let me wring your heart for so I shall If it be made of penetrable stuff If damned custom have not braz'd it so That it is proof and bulwark against sense Queen What have I done that thou dar'st wag thy tongue In noise so rude against me Ham Such an act That blurs the grace and blush of modesty Calls virtue hypocrite takes off the rose From the fair forehead of an innocent love And sets a blister there makes marriage vows As false as dicers' oaths O such a deed As from the body of contraction plucks The very soul and sweet religion makes A rhapsody of words Heaven's face doth glow Yea this solidity and compound mass With tristful visage as against the doom Is thoughtsick at the act Queen Ay me what act That roars so loud and thunders in the index Ham Look here upon th's picture and on this The counterfeit presentment of two brothers See what a grace was seated on this brow Hyperion's curls the front of Jove himself An eye like Mars to threaten and command A station like the herald Mercury New lighted on a heavenkissing hill A combination and a form indeed Where every god did seem to set his seal To give the world assurance of a man This was your husband Look you now what follows Here is your husband like a mildew'd ear Blasting his wholesome brother Have you eyes Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed And batten on this moor Ha have you eyes You cannot call it love for at your age The heyday in the blood is tame it's humble And waits upon the judgment and what judgment Would step from this to this Sense sure you have Else could you not have motion but sure that sense Is apoplex'd for madness would not err Nor sense to ecstacy was ne'er so thrall'd But it reserv'd some quantity of choice To serve in such a difference What devil was't That thus hath cozen'd you at hoodmanblind Eyes without feeling feeling without sight Ears without hands or eyes smelling sans all Or but a sickly part of one true sense Could not so mope O shame where is thy blush Rebellious hell If thou canst mutine in a matron's bones To flaming youth let virtue be as wax And melt in her own fire Proclaim no shame When the compulsive ardour gives the charge Since frost itself as actively doth burn And reason panders will Queen O Hamlet speak no more Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul And there I see such black and grained spots As will not leave their tinct Ham Nay but to live In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed Stew'd in corruption honeying and making love Over the nasty sty Queen O speak to me no more These words like daggersin mine ears No more sweet Hamlet Ham A murtherer and a villain A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe Of your precedent lord a vice of kings A cutpurse of the empire and the rule That from a shelf the precious diadem stole And put it in his pocket Queen No morethe Ghost in his nightgown Ham A king of shreds and patches Save me and hover o'er me with your wings You heavenly guards What would your gracious figure Queen Alas he's mad Ham Do you not come your tardy son to chide That laps'd in time and passion lets go by Th' important acting of your dread command O say Ghost Do not forget This visitation Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose But look amazement on thy mother sits O step between her and her fighting soul Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works Speak to her Hamlet Ham How is it with you lady Queen Alas how is't with you That you do bend your eye on vacancy And with th' encorporal air do hold discourse Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep And as the sleeping soldiers in th' alarm Your bedded hairs like life in excrements Start up and stand an end O gentle son Upon the beat and flame of thy distemper Sprinkle cool patience Whereon do you look Ham On him on him Look you how pale he glares His form and cause conjoin'd preaching to stones Would make them capable Do not look upon me Lest with this piteous action you convert My stern effects Then what I have to do Will want true colour tears perchance for blood Queen To whom do you speak this Ham Do you see nothing there Queen Nothing at all yet all that is I see Ham Nor did you nothing hear Queen No nothing but ourselves Ham Why look you there Look how it steals away My father in his habit as he liv'd Look where he goes even now out at the portal Ghost Queen This is the very coinage of your brain This bodiless creation ecstasy Is very cunning in Ham Ecstasy My pulse as yours doth temperately keep time And makes as healthful music It is not madness That I have utt'red Bring me to the test And I the matter will reword which madness Would gambol from Mother for love of grace Lay not that flattering unction to your soul That not your trespass but my madness speaks It will but skin and film the ulcerous place Whiles rank corruption mining all within Infects unseen Confess yourself to heaven Repent what's past avoid what is to come And do not spread the compost on the weeds To make them ranker Forgive me this my virtue For in the fatness of these pursy times Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg Yea curb and woo for leave to do him good Queen O Hamlet thou hast cleft my heart in twain Ham O throw away the worser part of it And live the purer with the other half Good night but go not to my uncle's bed Assume a virtue if you have it not That monster custom who all sense doth eat Of habits evil is angel yet in this That to the use of actions fair and good He likewise gives a frock or livery That aptly is put on Refrain tonight And that shall lend a kind of easiness To the next abstinence the next more easy For use almost can change the stamp of nature And either master the devil or throw him out With wondrous potency Once more good night And when you are desirous to be blest I'll blessing beg of you For this same lord I do repent but heaven hath pleas'd it so To punish me with this and this with me That I must be their scourge and minister I will bestow him and will answer well The death I gave him So again good night I must be cruel only to be kind Thus bad begins and worse remains behind One word more good lady Queen What shall I do Ham Not this by no means that I bid you do Let the bloat King tempt you again to bed Pinch wanton on your cheek call you his mouse And let him for a pair of reechy kisses Or paddling in your neck with his damn'd fingers Make you to ravel all this matter out That I essentially am not in madness But mad in craft 'Twere good you let him know For who that's but a queen fair sober wise Would from a paddock from a bat a gib Such dear concernings hide Who would do so No in despite of sense and secrecy Unpeg the basket on the house's top Let the birds fly and like the famous ape To try conclusions in the basket creep And break your own neck down Queen Be thou assur'd if words be made of breath And breath of life I have no life to breathe What thou hast said to me Ham I must to England you know that Queen Alack I had forgot 'Tis so concluded on Ham There's letters seal'd and my two schoolfellows Whom I will trust as I will adders fang'd They bear the mandate they must sweep my way And marshal me to knavery Let it work For 'tis the sport to have the enginer Hoist with his own petar and 't shall go hard But I will delve one yard below their mines And blow them at the moon O 'tis most sweet When in one line two crafts directly meet This man shall set me packing I'll lug the guts into the neighbour room Mother good night Indeed this counsellor Is now most still most secret and most grave Who was in life a foolish peating knave Come sir to draw toward an end with you Good night motherthe Queen ThenHamlet tugging inPolonius
