 England King Richard the ThirdLondon A street solusNow is the winter of our discontent Made glorious summer by this sun of York And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house In the deep bosom of the ocean buried Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths Our bruised arms hung up for monuments Our stern alarums chang'd to merry meetings Our dreadful marches to delightful measures Grimvisag'd war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front And now instead of mounting barbed steeds To fright the souls of fearful adversaries He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber To the lascivious pleasing of a lute But Ithat am not shap'd for sportive tricks Nor made to court an amorous lookingglass Ithat am rudely stamp'd and want love's majesty To strut before a wanton ambling nymph Ithat am curtail'd of this fair proportion Cheated of feature by dissembling nature Deform'd unfinish'd sent before my time Into this breathing world scarce half made up And that so lamely and unfashionable That dogs bark at me as I halt by them Why I in this weak piping time of peace Have no delight to pass away the time Unless to spy my shadow in the sun And descant on mine own deformity And therefore since I cannot prove a lover To tain these fair wellspoken days I am determined to prove a villain And hate the idle pleasures of these days Plots have I laid inductions dangerous By drunken prophecies libels and dreams To set my brother Clarence and the King In deadly hate the one against the other And if King Edward be as true and just As I am subtle false and treacherous This day should Clarence closely be mew'd up About a prophecy which says that G Of Edward's heirs the murderer shall be Dive thoughts down to my soul Here Clarence comesguarded andBrother good day What means this armed guard That waits upon your GraceHis Majesty Tend'ring my person's safety hath appointed This conduct to convey me to th' TowerUpon what causeBecause my name is GeorgeAlack my lord that fault is none of yours He should for that commit your godfathers O belike his Majesty hath some intent That you should be newchrist'ned in the Tower But what's the matter Clarence May I knowYea Richard when I know for I protest As yet I do not but as I can learn He hearkens after prophecies and dreams And from the crossrow plucks the letter G And says a wizard told him that by G His issue disinherited should be And for my name of George begins with G It follows in his thought that I am he These as I learn and such like toys as these Hath mov'd his Highness to commit me nowWhy this it is when men are rul'd by women 'Tis not the King that sends you to the Tower My Lady Grey his wife Clarence 'tis she That tempers him to this extremity Was it not she and that good man of worship Antony Woodville her brother there That made him send Lord Hastings to the Tower From whence this present day he is delivered We are not safe Clarence we are not safeBy heaven I think there is no man is secure But the Queen's kindred and nightwalking heralds That trudge betwixt the King and Mistress Shore Heard you not what an humble suppliant Lord Hastings was for her deliveryHumbly complaining to her deity Got my Lord Chamberlain his liberty I'll tell you whatI think it is our way If we will keep in favour with the King To be her men and wear her livery The jealous o'erworn widow and herself Since that our brother dubb'd them gentlewomen Are mighty gossips in our monarchyI beseech your Graces both to pardon me His Majesty hath straitly given in charge That no man shall have private conference Of what degree soever with your brotherEven so an't please your worship Brakenbury You may partake of any thing we say We speak no treason man we say the King Is wise and virtuous and his noble queen Well struck in years fair and not jealous We say that Shore's wife hath a pretty foot A cherry lip a bonny eye a passing pleasing tongue And that the Queen's kindred are made gentlefolks How say you sir Can you deny all thisWith this my lord myself have naught to doNaught to do with Mistress Shore I tell thee fellow He that doth naught with her excepting one Were best to do it secretly aloneWhat one my lordHer husband knave Wouldst thou betray meI do beseech your Grace to pardon me and withal Forbear your conference with the noble DukeWe know thy charge Brakenbury and will obeyWe are the Queen's abjects and must obey Brother farewell I will unto the King And whatsoe'er you will employ me in Were it to call King Edward's widow sister I will perform it to enfranchise you Meantime this deep disgrace in brotherhood Touches me deeper than you can imagineI know it pleaseth neither of us wellWell your imprisonment shall not be long I will deliver or else lie for you Meantime have patienceI must perforce Farewelland guardGo tread the path that thou shalt ne'er return Simple plain Clarence I do love thee so That I will shortly send thy soul to heaven If heaven will take the present at our hands But who comes here The newdelivered Hastings Good time of day unto my gracious lordAs much unto my good Lord Chamberlain Well are you welcome to the open air How hath your lordship brook'd imprisonmentWith patience noble lord as prisoners must But I shall live my lord to give them thanks That were the cause of my imprisonmentNo doubt no doubt and so shall Clarence too For they that were your enemies are his And have prevail'd as much on him as youMore pity that the eagles should be mew'd Whiles kites and buzzards prey at libertyWhat news abroadNo news so bad abroad as this at home The King is sickly weak and melancholy And his physicians fear him mightilyNow by Saint John that news is bad indeed O he hath kept an evil diet long And overmuch consum'd his royal person 'Tis very grievous to be thought upon Where is he In his bedHe isGo you before and I will follow youHe cannot live I hope and must not die Till George be pack'd with posthorse up to heaven I'll in to urge his hatred more to Clarence With lies well steel'd with weighty arguments And if I fail not in my deep intent Clarence hath not another day to live Which done God take King Edward to his mercy And leave the world for me to bustle in For then I'll marry Warwick's youngest daughter What though I kill'd her husband and her father The readiest way to make the wench amends Is to become her husband and her father The which will Inot all so much for love As for another secret close intent By marrying her which I must reach unto But yet I run before my horse to market Clarence still breathes Edward still lives and reigns When they are gone then must I count my gainsLondon Another streetcorpse ofwith halberds to guard it being the mourner attended by and Set down set down your honourable load If honour may be shrouded in a

forth thy life I pour the helpless balm of my poor eyes O cursed be the hand that made these holes Cursed the heart that had the heart to do it Cursed the blood that let this blood from hence More direful hap betide that hated wretch That makes us wretched by the death of thee Than I can wish to adders spiders toads Or any creeping venom'd thing that lives If ever he have child abortive be it

Lady Anne To leave this keen encounter of our wits And fall something into a slower method Is not the causer of the timeless deaths Of these Plantagenets Henry and Edward As blameful as the executionerThou wast the cause and most accurs'd effectYour beauty was the cause of that effect Your beauty that did haunt me in my sleep To undertake the death of all the world So I might live one hour in your sweet bosomIf I thought that I tell thee homicide These nails should rend that beauty from my cheeksThese eyes could not endure that beauty's wreck You should not blemish it if I stood by

eyesThine eyes sweet lady have infected mineWould they were basilisks to strike thee deadI would they were that I might die at once For now they kill me with a living death Those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears Sham'd their aspects with store of childish drops These eyes which never shed remorseful tear No when my father York and Edward wept To hear the piteous moan that Rutland made When blackfac'd Clifford shook his sword at him Nor when thy warlike father like a child Told the sad story of my father's death And twenty times made pause to sob and weep That all the standersby had wet their cheeks Like trees bedash'd with rainin that sad time My manly eyes did scorn an humble tear And what these sorrows could not thence exhale Thy beauty hath and made them blind with weeping I never sued to friend nor enemy My tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word But now thy beauty is propos'd my fee My proud heart sues and prompts my tongue to speakShe looks scornfully at him Teach not thy lip such scorn for it was made For kissing lady not for such contempt If thy revengeful heart cannot forgive Lo here I lend thee this sharppointed sword Which if thou please to hide in this true breast And let the soul forth that adoreth thee I lay it naked to the deadly stroke And humbly beg the death upon my knee He lays his breast open she offers at it with his sword Nay do not pause for I did kill King Henry But 'twas thy beauty that provoked me Nay now dispatch 'twas I that stabb'd young Edward But 'twas thy heavenly face that set me onShe falls the sword

With curses in her mouth tears in her eyes The bleeding witness of my hatred by Having God her conscience and these bars against me And I no friends to back my suit at all But the plain devil and dissembling looks And yet to win her all the world to nothing Ha Hath she forgot already that brave prince Edward her lord whom I some three months since Stabb'd in my angry mood at Tewksbury A sweeter and a lovelier gentleman Fram'd in the prodigality of nature Young valiant wise and no doubt right royal The spacious world cannot again afford And will she yet abase her eyes on me That cropp'd the golden prime of this sweet prince And made her widow to a woeful bed On me whose all not equals Edward's moiety On me that halts and am misshapen thus My dukedom to a beggarly denier I do mistake my person all this while Upon my life she finds although I cannot Myself to be a marv'llous proper man I'll be at charges for a lookingglass And tain a score or two of tailors To study

Because I cannot flatter and look fair Smile in men's faces smooth deceive and cog Duck with French nods and apish courtesy I must be held a rancorous enemy Cannot a plain man live and think no harm

wrong Or thee or thee or any of your faction A plague upon you all His royal Grace Whom God preserve better than you would wish Cannot be quiet searce a breathing while But you must trouble him with lewd complaintsBrother of Gloucester you mistake the matter The King on his own royal disposition And not provok'd by any suitor else Aiming belike at your interior hatred That in your outward action shows itself Against my children brothers and myself Makes him to send that he may learn the groundI cannot tell the world is grown so bad That wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch Since every

Gloucester I have too long borne Your blunt upbraidings and your bitter scoffs By heaven I will acquaint his Majesty Of those gross taunts that oft I have endur'd I had rather be a country servantmaid

kingdom all of you allegiance This sorrow that I have by right is yours And all the pleasures you usurp are mineThe curse my noble father laid on thee When thou didst crown his warlike brows with paper And with thy scorns drew'st rivers from his eyes And then to dry them gav'st the Duke a clout Steep'd in the faultless blood of pretty Rutland His curses then from bitterness of soul Denounc'd against thee are all fall'n upon thee And God not we hath plagu'd thy bloody deedSo just is God to right the innocentO 'twas the foulest deed to slay that babe And the most merciless that e'er was heard ofTyrants themselves wept when it was reportedNo man but prophesied revenge for itNorthumberland then present wept to see itWhat were you snarling all before I came Ready to catch each other by the throat And turn you all your hatred now on me Did York's dread curse prevail so much with heaven That Henry's death my lovely Edward's death Their kingdom's loss my woeful banishment Should all

I have pass'd a miserable night So full of fearful dreams of ugly sights That as I am a Christian faithful man I would not spend another such a night Though 'twere to buy a world of happy days So full of dismal terror was the timeWhat was your dream my lord I pray you tell meMethoughts that I had broken from the Tower And was embark'd to cross to Burgundy And in my company my brother Gloucester Who from my cabin tempted me to walk Upon the hatches Thence we look'd toward England And cited up a thousand heavy times During the wars of York and Lancaster That had befall'n us As we pac'd along Upon the giddy footing of the hatches Methought that Gloucester stumbled and in falling Struck me that thought to stay him overboard Into the tumbling billows of the main O Lord methought what pain it was to drown What dreadful noise of waters in my ears What sights of ugly death within my eyes Methoughts I saw a thousand fearful wrecks A thousand men that fishes gnaw'd upon Wedges of gold great anchors heaps of pearl Inestimable stones unvalued jewels All scatt'red in the bottom of the sea Some lay in dead men's skulls and in the holes Where eyes did once inhabit there were crept As 'twere in scorn of eyes reflecting gems That woo'd the slimy bottom of the deep And mock'd the dead bones that lay scatt'red byHad you such leisure in the time of death To gaze upon these secrets of the deepMethought I had and often did I strive To yield the ghost but still the envious flood Stopp'd in my soul and would not let it forth To find the empty vast and wand'ring air But smother'd it within my panting bulk Who almost burst to belch it in the seaAwak'd you not in this sore agonyNo no my dream was lengthen'd after life O then began the tempest to my soul I pass'd methought the melancholy flood With that sour ferryman which poets write of Unto the kingdom of perpetual night The first that there did greet my stranger soul Was my great fatherinlaw renowned Warwick Who spake aloud 'What scourge for perjury Can this dark monarchy afford false Clarence' And so he vanish'd Then came wand'ring by A shadow like an angel with bright hair Dabbled in blood and he shriek'd out aloud 'Clarence is comefalse fleeting perjur'd Clarence That stabb'd me in the field by Tewksbury Seize on him Furies take him unto torment' With that methoughts a legion of foul fiends Environ'd me and howled in mine ears Such hideous cries that with the very noise I trembling wak'd and for a season after Could not believe but that I was in hell Such terrible impression made my dreamNo marvel lord though it affrighted you I am afraid methinks to hear you tell itAh Keeper Keeper I have done these things That now give evidence against my soul For Edward's sake and see how he requites me O God If my deep prayers cannot appease Thee But Thou wilt be aveng'd on my misdeeds Yet execute Thy wrath in me alone O spare my guiltless wife and my poor childrenI prithee sit by me awhile My soul is heavy and I fain would sleepI will my lord God give your Grace good restsleepsthe LieutenantSorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours Makes the night morning and the noontide night Princes have but their titles for their glories An outward honour for an inward toil And for unfelt imaginations They often feel a world of restless cares So that between their tides and low name There's nothing differs but the outward famethe two Ho who's hereWhat wouldst thou fellow and how cam'st thou hitherI would speak with Clarence and I came hither on my legsWhat so brief'Tis better sir than to be tedious Let him see our commission and talk no morereads itI am in this commanded to deliver The noble Duke of Clarence to your hands I will not reason what is meant hereby Because I will be guiltless from the meaning There lies the Duke asleep and there the keys I'll to the King and signify to him That thus I have resign'd to you my chargeYou may sir 'tis a point of wisdom Fare you wellWhat shall I stab him as he sleepsNo he'll say 'twas done cowardly when he wakesWhy he shall never wake until the great judgmentdayWhy then he'll say we stabb'd him sleepingThe urging of that word judgment hath bred a kind of remorse in meWhat art thou afraidNot to kill him having a warrant but to be damn'd for killing him from the which no warrant can defend meI thought thou hadst been resoluteSo I am to let him liveI'll back to the Duke of Gloucester and tell him soNay I prithee stay a little I hope this passionate humour of mine will change it was wont to hold me but while one tells twentyHow dost thou feel thyself nowFaith some certain dregs of conscience are yet within meRemember our reward when the deed's doneZounds he dies I had forgot the rewardWhere's thy conscience nowO in the Duke of Gloucester's purseWhen he opens his purse to give us our reward thy conscience flies out'Tis no matter let it go there's few or none will tain itWhat if it come to thee againI'll not meddle with itit makes a man coward a man cannot steal but it accuseth him a man cannot swear but it checks him a man cannot lie with his neighbour's wife but it detects him 'Tis a blushing shame fac'd spirit that mutinies in a man's bosom it fills a man full of obstacles it made me once restore a purse of gold thatby chance I found It beggars any man that keeps it It is turn'd out of towns and cities for a dangerous thing and every man that means to live well endeavours to trust to himself and live without itZounds 'tis even now at my elbow persuading me not to kill the DukeTake the devil in thy mind and believe him not he would insinuate with thee but to make the sighI am strongfram'd he cannot prevail with meSpoke like a tall man that respects thy reputation Come shall we fall to workTake him on the costard with the hilts of thy sword and then chop him in the malmseybutt in the next roomO excellent device and make a sop of himSoft he wakesStrikeNo we'll reason with himWhere art thou Keeper Give me a cup of wineYou shall have wine enough my lord anonIn God's name what art thouA man as you areBut not as I am royalNor you as we are loyalThy voice is thunder but thy looks are humbleMy voice is now the King's my looks mine ownHow darkly and how deadly dost thou speak Your eyes do menace me Why look you pale Who sent you hither Wherefore do you comeTo to toTo murder meAy ayYou scarcely have the hearts to tell me so And therefore cannot have the hearts to do it Wherein my friends have I offended youOffended us you have not but the KingI shall be reconcil'd to him againNever my lord therefore prepare to dieAre you drawn forth among a world of men To slay the innocent What is my offence Where is the evidence that doth accuse me What lawful quest have given their verdict up Unto the frowning judge or who pronounc'd The bitter sentence of poor Clarence' death Before I be convict by course of law To threaten me with death is most unlawful I charge you as you hope to have redemption By Christ's dear blood shed for our grievous sins That you depart and lay no hands on me The deed you undertake is damnableWhat we will do we do upon commandAnd he that hath commanded is our KingErroneous vassals the great King of kings Hath in the tables of his law commanded That thou shalt do no murder Will you then Spurn at his edict and fulfil a man's Take heed for he holds vengeance in his hand To hurl upon their heads that break his lawAnd that same vengeance doth he hurl on thee For false forswearing and for murder too Thou didst receive the sacrament to fight In quarrel of the house of LancasterAnd like a traitor to the name of God Didst break that vow and with thy treacherous blade Unripp'dst the bowels of thy sov'reign's sonWhom thou wast sworn to cherish and defendHow canst thou urge God's dreadful law to us When thou hast broke it in such dear degreeAlas for whose sake did I that ill deed For Edward for my brother for his sake He sends you not to murder me for this For in that sin he is as deep asIf God will be avenged for the deed O know you yet He doth it publicly Take not the quarrel from His pow'rful arm He needs no indirect or lawless course To cut off those that have offended HimWho made thee then a bloody minister When gallantspringing brave Plantagenet That princely novice was struck dead by theeMy brother's love the devil and my rageThy brother's love our duty and thy faults Provoke us hither now to slaughter theeIf you do love my brother hate not me I am his brother and I love him well If you are hir'd for meed go back again And I will send you to my brother Gloucester Who shall reward you better for my life Than Edward will for tidings of my deathYou are deceiv'd your brother Gloucester hates youO no he loves me and he holds me dear Go you to him from meAy so we willTell him when that our princely father York Bless'd his three sons with his victorious arm And charg'd us from his soul to love each other He little thought of this divided friendship Bid Gloucester think of this and he will weepAy millstones as he lesson'd us to weepO do not slander him for he is kindRight as snow in harvest Come you deceive yourself 'Tis he that sends us to destroy you hereIt cannot be for he bewept my fortune And hugg'd me in his arms and swore with sobs That he would labour my deliveryWhy so he doth when he delivers you From this earth's thraldom to the joys of heavenMake peace with God for you must die my lordHave you that holy feeling in your souls To counsel me to make my peace with God And are you yet to your own souls so blind That you will war with God by murd'ring me O sirs consider they that set you on To do this deed will hate you for the deedWhat shall we doRelent and save your soulsRelent No 'tis cowardly and womanishNot to relent is beastly savage devilish Which of you if you were a prince's son Being pent from liberty as I am now If two such murderers as yourselves came to you Would not entreat for life My friend I spy some pity in thy looks O if thine eye be not a flatterer Come thou on my side and entreat for me As you would beg were you in my distress A begging prince what beggar pities notLook behind you my lord Stabbing himTake that and that If all this will not do I'll drown you in the malmseybutt withinwith the bodyA bloody deed and desperately dispatch'd How fain like Pilate would I wash my hands Of this most grievous murderReHow now what mean'st thou that thou help'st me not By heavens the Duke shall know how slack you have beenI would he knew that I had sav'd his brother Take thou the fee and tell him what I say For I repent me that the Duke is slain So do notGo coward as thou art Well I'll go hide the body in some hole Till that the Duke give order for his burial And when I have my meed I will away For this will out and then I must not stay
