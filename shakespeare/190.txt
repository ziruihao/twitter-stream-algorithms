Rome Before the palaceNow climbeth Tamora Olympus' top Safe out of Fortune's shot and sits aloft Secure of thunder's crack or lightning flash Advanc'd above pale envy's threat'ning reach As when the golden sun salutes the morn And having gilt the ocean with his beams Gallops the zodiac in his glistening coach And overlooks the highestpeering hills So Tamora Upon her wit doth earthly honour wait And virtue stoops and trembles at her frown Then Aaron arm thy heart and fit thy thoughts To mount aloft with thy imperial mistress And mount her pitch whom thou in triumph long Hast prisoner held fett'red in amorous chains And faster bound to Aaron's charming eyes Than is Prometheus tied to Caucasus Away with slavish weeds and servile thoughts I will be bright and shine in pearl and gold To wait upon this newmade emperess To wait said I To wanton with this queen This goddess this Semiramis this nymph This siren that will charm Rome's Saturnine And see his shipwreck and his commonweal's Hullo what storm is thisandbravingChiron thy years wants wit thy wits wants edge And manners to intrude where I am grac'd And may for aught thou knowest affected beDemetrius thou dost overween in all And so in this to bear me down with braves 'Tis not the difference of a year or two Makes me less gracious or thee more fortunate I am as able and as fit as thou To serve and to deserve my mistress' grace And that my sword upon thee shall approve And plead my passions for Lavinia's love AsideClubs clubs These lovers will not keep the peaceWhy boy although our mother unadvis'd Gave you a dancing rapier by your side Are you so desperate grown to threat your friends Go to have your lath glued within your sheath Till you know better how to handle itMeanwhile sir with the little skill I have Full well shalt thou perceive how much I dareAy boy grow ye so braveThey draw Coming forwardWhy how now lords So near the Emperor's palace dare ye draw And maintain such a quarrel openly Full well I wot the ground of all this grudge I would not for a million of gold The cause were known to them it most concerns Nor would your noble mother for much more Be so dishonoured in the court of Rome For shame put upNot I till I have sheath'd My rapier in his bosom and withal Thrust those reproachful speeches down his throat That he hath breath'd in my dishonour hereFor that I am prepar'd and full resolv'd Foulspoken coward that thund'rest with thy tongue And with thy weapon nothing dar'st performAway I say Now by the gods that warlike Goths adore This pretty brabble will undo us all Why lords and think you not how dangerous It is to jet upon a prince's right What is Lavinia then become so loose Or Bassianus so degenerate That for her love such quarrels may be broach'd Without controlment justice or revenge Young lords beware an should the Empress know This discord's ground the music would not pleaseI care not I knew she and all the world I love Lavinia more than all the worldYoungling learn thou to make some meaner choice Lavina is thine elder brother's hopeWhy are ye mad or know ye not in Rome How furious and impatient they be And cannot brook competitors in love I tell you lords you do but plot your deaths By this deviceAaron a thousand deaths Would I propose to achieve her whom I loveTo achieve her howWhy mak'st thou it so strange She is a woman therefore may be woo'd She is a woman therefore may be won She is Lavinia therefore must be lov'd What man more water glideth by the mill Than wots the miller of and easy it is Of a cut loaf to steal a shive we know Though Bassianus be the Emperor's brother Better than he have worn Vulcan's badge AsideAy and as good as Saturninus mayThen why should he despair that knows to court it With words fair looks and liberality What hast not thou full often struck a doe And borne her cleanly by the keeper's noseWhy then it seems some certain snatch or so Would serve your turnsAy so the turn were servedAaron thou hast hit itWould you had hit it too Then should not we be tir'd with this ado Why hark ye hark ye and are you such fools To square for this Would it offend you then That both should speedFaith not meNor me so I were oneFor shame be friends and join for that you jar 'Tis policy and stratagem must do That you affect and so must you resolve That what you cannot as you would achieve You must perforce accomplish as you may Take this of me Lucrece was not more chaste Than this Lavinia Bassianus' love A speedier course than ling'ring languishment Must we pursue and I have found the path My lords a solemn hunting is in hand There will the lovely Roman ladies troop The forest walks are wide and spacious And many unfrequented plots there are Fitted by kind for rape and villainy Single you thither then this dainty doe And strike her home by force if not by words This way or not at all stand you in hope Come come our Empress with her sacred wit To villainy and vengeance consecrate Will we acquaint with all what we intend And she shall file our engines with advice That will not suffer you to square yourselves But to your wishes' height advance you both The Emperor's court is like the house of Fame The palace full of tongues of eyes and ears The woods are ruthless dreadful deaf and dull There speak and strike brave boys and take your turns There serve your lust shadowed from heaven's eye And revel in Lavinia's treasuryThy counsel lad smells of no cowardiceSit fas aut nefas till I find the stream To cool this heat a charm to calm these fits Per Styga per manes vehor A forest near Rome and his three sonsmaking a noise with hounds and horns and The hunt is up the morn is bright and grey The fields are fragrant and the woods are green Uncouple here and let us make a bay And wake the Emperor and his lovely bride And rouse the Prince and ring a hunter's peal That all the court may echo with the noise Sons let it be your charge as it is ours To attend the Emperor's person carefully I have been troubled in my sleep this night But dawning day new comfort hath inspir'dHere a cry of hounds and wind horns in a pealThen and their attendants Many good morrows to your Majesty Madam to you as many and as good I promised your Grace a hunter's pealAnd you have rung it lustily my lords Somewhat too early for newmarried ladiesLavinia how say youI say no I have been broad awake two hours and moreCome on then horse and chariots let us have And to our sportTo Madam now shall ye see Our Roman huntingI have dogs my lord Will rouse the proudest panther in the chase And climb the highest promontory topAnd I have horse will follow where the game Makes way and run like swallows o'er the plainChiron we hunt not we with horse nor hound But hope to pluck a dainty doe to ground A lonely part of the forestalone with a bag of goldHe that had wit would think that I had none To bury so much gold under a tree And never after to inherit it Let him that thinks of me so abjectly Know that this gold must coin a stratagem Which cunningly effected will beget A very excellent piece of villainy And so repose sweet gold for their unrest Hides the gold That have their alms out of the Empress' chest alone to the MoorMy lovely Aaron wherefore look'st thou sad When everything does make a gleeful boast The birds chant melody on every bush The snakes lie rolled in the cheerful sun The green leaves quiver with the cooling wind And make a chequer'd shadow on the ground Under their sweet shade Aaron let us sit And while the babbling echo mocks the hounds Replying shrilly to the welltun'd horns As if a double hunt were heard at once Let us sit down and mark their yellowing noise And after conflict such as was suppos'd The wand'ring prince and Dido once enjoyed When with a happy storm they were surpris'd And curtain'd with a counselkeeping cave We may each wreathed in the other's arms Our pastimes done possess a golden slumber Whiles hounds and horns and sweet melodious birds Be unto us as is a nurse's song Of lullaby to bring her babe asleepMadam though Venus govern your desires Saturn is dominator over mine What signifies my deadlystanding eye My silence and my cloudy melancholy My fleece of woolly hair that now uncurls Even as an adder when she doth unroll To do some fatal execution No madam these are no venereal signs Vengeance is in my heart death in my hand Blood and revenge are hammering in my head Hark Tamora the empress of my soul Which never hopes more heaven than rests in thee This is the day of doom for Bassianus His Philomel must lose her tongue today Thy sons make pillage of her chastity And wash their hands in Bassianus' blood Seest thou this letter Take it up I pray thee And give the King this fatalplotted scroll Now question me no more we are espied Here comes a parcel of our hopeful booty Which dreads not yet their lives' destructionand Ah my sweet Moor sweeter to me than lifeNo more great Empress Bassianus comes Be cross with him and I'll go fetch thy sons To back thy quarrels whatsoe'er they be Who have we here Rome's royal Emperess Unfurnish'd of her wellbeseeming troop Or is it Dian habited like her Who hath abandoned her holy groves To see the general hunting in this forestSaucy controller of my private steps Had I the pow'r that some say Dian had Thy temples should be planted presently With horns as was Actaeon's and the hounds Should drive upon thy newtransformed limbs Unmannerly intruder as thou artUnder your patience gentle Emperess 'Tis thought you have a goodly gift in horning And to be doubted that your Moor and you Are singled forth to try thy experiments Jove shield your husband from his hounds today 'Tis pity they should take him for a stagBelieve me Queen your swarth Cimmerian Doth make your honour of his body's hue Spotted detested and abominable Why are you sequest'red from all your train Dismounted from your snowwhite goodly steed And wand'red hither to an obscure plot Accompanied but with a barbarous Moor If foul desire had not conducted youAnd being intercepted in your sport Great reason that my noble lord be rated For sauciness I pray you let us hence And let her joy her ravencoloured love This valley fits the purpose passing wellThe King my brother shall have notice of thisAy for these slips have made him noted long Good king to be so mightily abusedWhy I have patience to endure all thisand How now dear sovereign and our gracious mother Why doth your Highness look so pale and wanHave I not reason think you to look pale These two have 'ticed me hither to this place A barren detested vale you see it is The trees though summer yet forlorn and lean Overcome with moss and baleful mistletoe Here never shines the sun here nothing breeds Unless the nightly owl or fatal raven And when they show'd me this abhorred pit They told me here at dead time of the night A thousand fiends a thousand hissing snakes Ten thousand swelling toads as many urchins Would make such fearful and confused cries As any mortal body hearing it Should straight fall mad or else die suddenly No sooner had they told this hellish tale But straight they told me they would bind me here Unto the body of a dismal yew And leave me to this miserable death And then they call'd me foul adulteress Lascivious Goth and all the bitterest terms That ever ear did hear to such effect And had you not by wondrous fortune come This vengeance on me had they executed Revenge it as you love your mother's life Or be ye not henceforth call'd my childrenThis is a witness that I am thy sonStabs And this for me struck home to show my strength Also stabsAy come Semiramis nay barbarous Tamora For no name fits thy nature but thy ownGive me the poniard you shall know my boys Your mother's hand shall right your mother's wrongStay madam here is more belongs to her First thrash the corn then after burn the straw This minion stood upon her chastity Upon her nuptial vow her loyalty And with that painted hope braves your mightiness And shall she carry this unto her graveAn if she do I would I were an eunuch Drag hence her husband to some secret hole And make his dead trunk pillow to our lustBut when ye have the honey we desire Let not this wasp outlive us both to stingI warrant you madam we will make that sure Come mistress now perforce we will enjoy That nicepreserved honesty of yoursO Tamora thou bearest a woman's faceI will not hear her speak away with herSweet lords entreat her hear me but a wordListen fair madam let it be your glory To see her tears but be your heart to them As unrelenting flint to drops of rainWhen did the tiger's young ones teach the dam O do not learn her wrath she taught it thee The milk thou suck'dst from her did turn to marble Even at thy teat thou hadst thy tyranny Yet every mother breeds not sons alike To Do thou entreat her show a woman's pityWhat wouldst thou have me prove myself a bastard'Tis true the raven doth not hatch a lark Yet have I heard O could I find it now The lion mov'd with pity did endure To have his princely paws par'd all away Some say that ravens foster forlorn children The whilst their own birds famish in their nests O be to me though thy hard heart say no Nothing so kind but something pitifulI know not what it means away with herO let me teach thee For my father's sake That gave thee life when well he might have slain thee Be not obdurate open thy deaf earsHadst thou in person ne'er offended me Even for his sake am I pitiless Remember boys I pour'd forth tears in vain To save your brother from the sacrifice But fierce Andronicus would not relent Therefore away with her and use her as you will The worse to her the better lov'd of meO Tamora be call'd a gentle queen And with thine own hands kill me in this place For 'tis not life that I have begg'd so long Poor I was slain when Bassianus diedWhat beg'st thou then Fond woman let me go'Tis present death I beg and one thing more That womanhood denies my tongue to tell O keep me from their worse than killing lust And tumble me into some loathsome pit Where never man's eye may behold my body Do this and be a charitable murdererSo should I rob my sweet sons of their fee No let them satisfy their lust on theeAway for thou hast stay'd us here too longNo grace no womanhood Ah beastly creature The blot and enemy to our general name Confusion fallNay then I'll stop your mouth Bring thou her husband This is the hole where Aaron bid us hide himthrows the bodyof into the pit then exeuntanddragging off Farewell my sons see that you make her sure Ne'er let my heart know merry cheer indeed Till all the Andronici be made away Now will I hence to seek my lovely Moor And let my spleenful sons this trull deflower Rewith twoof ' sons and Come on my lords the better foot before Straight will I bring you to the loathsome pit Where I espied the panther fast asleepMy sight is very dull whate'er it bodesAnd mine I promise you were it not for shame Well could I leave our sport to sleep awhile Falls into the pitWhat art thou fallen What subtle hole is this Whose mouth is covered with rudegrowing briers Upon whose leaves are drops of newshed blood As fresh as morning dew distill'd on flowers A very fatal place it seems to me Speak brother hast thou hurt thee with the fallO brother with the dismal'st object hurt That ever eye with sight made heart lament AsideNow will I fetch the King to find them here That he thereby may have a likely guess How these were they that made away his brother Why dost not comfort me and help me out From this unhallow'd and bloodstained holeI am surprised with an uncouth fear A chilling sweat o'erruns my trembling joints My heart suspects more than mine eye can seeTo prove thou hast a true divining heart Aaron and thou look down into this den And see a fearful sight of blood and deathAaron is gone and my compassionate heart Will not permit mine eyes once to behold The thing whereat it trembles by surmise O tell me who it is for ne'er till now Was I a child to fear I know not whatLord Bassianus lies beray'd in blood All on a heap like to a slaughtered lamb In this detested dark blooddrinking pitIf it be dark how dost thou know 'tis heUpon his bloody finger he doth wear A precious ring that lightens all this hole Which like a taper in some monument Doth shine upon the dead man's earthy cheeks And shows the ragged entrails of this pit So pale did shine the moon on Pyramus When he by night lay bath'd in maiden blood O brother help me with thy fainting hand If fear hath made thee faint as me it hath Out of this fell devouring receptacle As hateful as Cocytus' misty mouthReach me thy hand that I may help thee out Or wanting strength to do thee so much good I may be pluck'd into the swallowing womb Of this deep pit poor Bassianus' grave I have no strength to pluck thee to the brinkNor I no strength to climb without thy helpThy hand once more I will not loose again Till thou art here aloft or I below Thou canst not come to me I come to theeFalls inthe and the MoorAlong with me I'll see what hole is here And what he is that now is leapt into it Say who art thou that lately didst descend Into this gaping hollow of the earthThe unhappy sons of old Andronicus Brought hither in a most unlucky hour To find thy brother Bassianus deadMy brother dead I know thou dost but jest He and his lady both are at the lodge Upon the north side of this pleasant chase 'Tis not an hour since I left them thereWe know not where you left them all alive But out alas here have we found him deadRewithattendants and LuciusWhere is my lord the KingHere Tamora though griev'd with killing griefWhere is thy brother BassianusNow to the bottom dost thou search my wound Poor Bassianus here lies murderedThen all too late I bring this fatal writ The complot of this timeless tragedy And wonder greatly that man's face can fold In pleasing smiles such murderous tyrannyShe giveth a letter Reads'An if we miss to meet him handsomely Sweet huntsman Bassianus 'tis we mean Do thou so much as dig the grave for him Thou know'st our meaning Look for thy reward Among the nettles at the eldertree Which overshades the mouth of that same pit Where we decreed to bury Bassianus Do this and purchase us thy lasting friends' O Tamora was ever heard the like This is the pit and this the eldertree Look sirs if you can find the huntsman out That should have murdered Bassianus hereMy gracious lord here is the bag of gold To Two of thy whelps fell curs of bloody kind Have here bereft my brother of his life Sirs drag them from the pit unto the prison There let them bide until we have devis'd Some neverheardof torturing pain for themWhat are they in this pit O wondrous thing How easily murder is discoveredHigh Emperor upon my feeble knee I beg this boon with tears not lightly shed That this fell fault of my accursed sons Accursed if the fault be prov'd in themIf it be prov'd You see it is apparent Who found this letter Tamora was it youAndronicus himself did take it upI did my lord yet let me be their bail For by my fathers' reverend tomb I vow They shall be ready at your Highness' will To answer their suspicion with their livesThou shalt not bail them see thou follow me Some bring the murdered body some the murderers Let them not speak a word the guilt is plain For by my soul were there worse end than death That end upon them should be executedAndronicus I will entreat the King Fear not thy sons they shall do well enoughCome Lucius come stay not to talk with them Another part of the forestthe Empress' sons andwithher hands cut off and her tongue cut out and ravish'dSo now go tell an if thy tongue can speak Who 'twas that cut thy tongue and ravish'd theeWrite down thy mind bewray thy meaning so An if thy stumps will let thee play the scribeSee how with signs and tokens she can scrowlGo home call for sweet water wash thy handsShe hath no tongue to call nor hands to wash And so let's leave her to her silent walksAn 'twere my cause I should go hang myselfIf thou hadst hands to help thee knit the cord Wind horns from huntingWho is this my niece that flies away so fast Cousin a word where is your husband If I do dream would all my wealth would wake me If I do wake some planet strike me down That I may slumber an eternal sleep Speak gentle niece What stern ungentle hands Hath lopp'd and hew'd and made thy body bare Of her two branches those sweet ornaments Whose circling shadows kings have sought to sleep in And might not gain so great a happiness As half thy love Why dost not speak to me Alas a crimson river of warm blood Like to a bubbling fountain stirr'd with wind Doth rise and fall between thy rosed lips Coming and going with thy honey breath But sure some Tereus hath deflowered thee And lest thou shouldst detect him cut thy tongue Ah now thou turn'st away thy face for shame And notwithstanding all this loss of blood As from a conduit with three issuing spouts Yet do thy cheeks look red as Titan's face Blushing to be encount'red with a cloud Shall I speak for thee Shall I say 'tis so O that I knew thy heart and knew the beast That I might rail at him to ease my mind Sorrow concealed like an oven stopp'd Doth burn the heart to cinders where it is Fair Philomel why she but lost her tongue And in a tedious sampler sew'd her mind But lovely niece that mean is cut from thee A craftier Tereus cousin hast thou met And he hath cut those pretty fingers off That could have better sew'd than Philomel O had the monster seen those lily hands Tremble like aspen leaves upon a lute And make the silken strings delight to kiss them He would not then have touch'd them for his life Or had he heard the heavenly harmony Which that sweet tongue hath made He would have dropp'd his knife and fell asleep As Cerberus at the Thracian poet's feet Come let us go and make thy father blind For such a sight will blind a father's eye One hour's storm will drown the fragrant meads What will whole months of tears thy father's eyes Do not draw back for we will mourn with thee O could our mourning case thy misery
