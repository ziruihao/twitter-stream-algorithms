 SceneA churchDon Pedro John the Bastard Leonato Friar Francis Claudio Benedick Hero Beatrice and Attendants Leon Come Friar Francis be brief Only to the plain form of marriage and you shall recount their particular duties afterwards Friar You come hither my lord to marry this lady Claud No Leon To be married to her Friar you come to marry her Friar Lady you come hither to be married to this count Hero I do Friar If either of you know any inward impediment why you should not be conjoined I charge you on your souls to utter it Claud Know you any Hero Hero None my lord Friar Know you any Count Leon I dare make his answernone Claud O what men dare do what men may do what men daily do not knowing what they do Bene How now interjections Why then some be of laughing as ah ha he Claud Stand thee by friar Father by your leave Will you with free and unconstrained soul Give me this maid your daughter Leon As freely son as God did give her me Claud And what have I to give you back whose worth May counterpoise this rich and precious gift Pedro Nothing unless you render her again Claud Sweet Prince you learn me noble thankfulness There Leonato take her back again Give not this rotten orange to your friend She's but the sign and semblance of her honour Behold how like a maid she blushes here O what authority and show of truth Can cunning sin cover itself withal Comes not that blood as modest evidence To witness simple virtue Would you not swear All you that see her that she were a maid By these exterior shows But she is none She knows the heat of a luxurious bed Her blush is guiltiness not modesty Leon What do you mean my lord Claud Not to be married Not to knit my soul to an approved wanton Leon Dear my lord if you in your own proof Have vanquish'd the resistance of her youth And made defeat of her virginity Claud I know what you would say If I have known her You will say she did embrace me as a husband And so extenuate the forehand sin No Leonato I never tempted her with word too large But as a brother to his sister show'd Bashful sincerity and comely love Hero And seem'd I ever otherwise to you Claud Out on the seeming I will write against it You seem to me as Dian in her orb As chaste as is the bud ere it be blown But you are more intemperate in your blood Than Venus or those pamp'red animals That rage in savage sensuality Hero Is my lord well that he doth speak so wide Leon Sweet Prince why speak not you Pedro What should I speak I stand dishonour'd that have gone about To link my dear friend to a common stale Leon Are these things spoken or do I but dream John Sir they are spoken and these things are true Bene This looks not like a nuptial Hero 'True' O God Claud Leonato stand I here Is this the Prince Is this the Prince's brother Is this face Hero's Are our eyes our own Leon All this is so but what of this my lord Claud Let me but move one question to your daughter And by that fatherly and kindly power That you have in her bid her answer truly Leon I charge thee do so as thou art my child Hero O God defend me How am I beset What kind of catechising call you this Claud To make you answer truly to your name Hero Is it not Hero Who can blot that name With any just reproach Claud Marry that can Hero Hero itself can blot out Hero's virtue What man was he talk'd with you yesternight Out at your window betwixt twelve and one Now if you are a maid answer to this Hero I talk'd with no man at that hour my lord Pedro Why then are you no maiden Leonato I am sorry you must hear Upon my honour Myself my brother and this grieved Count Did see her hear her at that hour last night Talk with a ruffian at her chamber window Who hath indeed most like a liberal villain Confess'd the vile encounters they have had A thousand times in secret John Fie fie they are not to be nam'd my lord Not to be spoke of There is not chastity enough in language Without offence to utter them Thus pretty lady I am sorry for thy much misgovernment Claud O Hero what a Hero hadst thou been If half thy outward graces had been plac'd About thy thoughts and counsels of thy heart But fare thee well most foul most fair Farewell Thou pure impiety and impious purity For thee I'll lock up all the gates of love And on my eyelids shall conjecture hang To turn all beauty into thoughts of harm And never shall it more be gracious Leon Hath no man's dagger here a point for me Hero swoons Beat Why how now cousin Wherefore sink you down John Come let us go These things come thus to light Smother her spirits upDon Pedro Don Juan and Claudio Bene How doth the lady Beat Dead I think Help uncle Hero why Hero Uncle Signior Benedick Friar Leon O Fate take not away thy heavy hand Death is the fairest cover for her shame That may be wish'd for Beat How now cousin Hero Friar Have comfort lady Leon Dost thou look up Friar Yea wherefore should she not Leon Wherefore Why doth not every earthly thing Cry shame upon her Could she here deny The story that is printed in her blood Do not live Hero do not ope thine eyes For did I think thou wouldst not quickly die Thought I thy spirits were stronger than thy shames Myself would on the rearward of reproaches Strike at thy life Griev'd I I had but one Child I for that at frugal nature's frame O one too much by thee Why had I one Why ever wast thou lovely in my eyes Why had I not with charitable hand Took up a beggar's issue at my gates Who smirched thus and mir'd with infamy I might have said 'No part of it is mine This shame derives itself from unknown loins' But mine and mine I lov'd and mine I prais'd And mine that I was proud onmine so much That I myself was to myself not mine Valuing of herwhy she O she is fall'n Into a pit of ink that the wide sea Hath drops too few to wash her clean again And salt too little which may season give To her foul tainted flesh Bene Sir sir be patient For my part I am so attir'd in wonder I know not what to say Beat O on my soul my cousin is belied Bene Lady were you her bedfellow last night Beat No truly not although until last night I have this twelvemonth been her bedfellow Leon Confirm'd confirm'd O that is stronger made Which was before barr'd up with ribs of iron Would the two princes lie and Claudio lie Who lov'd her so that speaking of her foulness Wash'd it with tears Hence from her let her die Friar Hear me a little For I have only been silent so long And given way unto this course of fortune By noting of the lady I have mark'd A thousand blushing apparitions To start into her face a thousand innocent shames In angel whiteness beat away those blushes And in her eye there hath appear'd a fire To burn the errors that these princes hold Against her maiden truth Call me a fool Trust not my reading nor my observation Which with experimental seal doth warrant The tenure of my book trust not my age My reverence calling nor divinity If this sweet lady lie not guiltless here Under some biting error Leon Friar it cannot be Thou seest that all the grace that she hath left Is that she will not add to her damnation A sin of perjury she not denies it Why seek'st thou then to cover with excuse That which appears in proper nakedness Friar Lady what man is he you are accus'd of Hero They know that do accuse me I know none If I know more of any man alive Than that which maiden modesty doth warrant Let all my sins lack mercy O my father Prove you that any man with me convers'd At hours unmeet or that I yesternight Maintain'd the change of words with any creature Refuse me hate me torture me to death Friar There is some strange misprision in the princes Bene Two of them have the very bent of honour And if their wisdoms be misled in this The practice of it lives in John the bastard Whose spirits toil in frame of villanies Leon I know not If they speak but truth of her These hands shall tear her If they wrong her honour The proudest of them shall well hear of it Time hath not yet so dried this blood of mine Nor age so eat up my invention Nor fortune made such havoc of my means Nor my bad life reft me so much of friends But they shall find awak'd in such a kind Both strength of limb and policy of mind Ability in means and choice of friends To quit me of them throughly Friar Pause awhile And let my counsel sway you in this case Your daughter here the princes left for dead Let her awhile be secretly kept in And publish it that she is dead indeed Maintain a mourning ostentation And on your family's old monument Hang mournful epitaphs and do all rites That appertain unto a burial Leon What shall become of this What will this do Friar Marry this well carried shall on her behalf Change slander to remorse That is some good But not for that dream I on this strange course But on this travail look for greater birth She dying as it must be so maintain'd Upon the instant that she was accus'd Shall be lamented pitied and excus'd Of every hearer for it so falls out That what we have we prize not to the worth Whiles we enjoy it but being lack'd and lost Why then we rack the value then we find The virtue that possession would not show us Whiles it was ours So will it fare with Claudio When he shall hear she died upon his words Th' idea of her life shall sweetly creep Into his study of imagination And every lovely organ of her life Shall come apparell'd in more precious habit More moving delicate and full of life Into the eye and prospect of his soul Than when she liv'd indeed Then shall he mourn If ever love had interest in his liver And wish he had not so accused her No though be thought his accusation true Let this be so and doubt not but success Will fashion the event in better shape Than I can lay it down in likelihood But if all aim but this be levell'd false The supposition of the lady's death Will quench the wonder of her infamy And if it sort not well you may conceal her As best befits her wounded reputation In some reclusive and religious life Out of all eyes tongues minds and injuries Bene Signior Leonato let the friar advise you And though you know my inwardness and love Is very much unto the Prince and Claudio Yet by mine honour I will deal in this As secretly and justly as your soul Should with your body Leon Being that I flow in grief The smallest twine may lead me Friar 'Tis well consented Presently away For to strange sores strangely they strain the cure Come lady die to live This wedding day Perhaps is but prolong'd Have patience and endure all but Benedick and Beatrice Bene Lady Beatrice have you wept all this while Beat Yea and I will weep a while longer Bene I will not desire that Beat You have no reason I do it freely Bene Surely I do believe your fair cousin is wronged Beat Ah how much might the man deserve of me that would righther Bene Is there any way to show such friendship Beat A very even way but no such friend Bene May a man do it Beat It is a man's office but not yours Bene I do love nothing in the world so well as you Is not that strange Beat As strange as the thing I know not It were as possible for me to say I loved nothing so well as you But believe me not and yet I lie not I confess nothing nor I deny nothing I am sorry for my cousin Bene By my sword Beatrice thou lovest me Beat Do not swear and eat it Bene I will swear by it that you love me and I will make him eat it that says I love not you Beat Will you not eat your word Bene With no sauce that can be devised to it I protest I love thee Beat Why then God forgive me Bene What offence sweet Beatrice Beat You have stayed me in a happy hour I was about to protest I loved you Bene And do it with all thy heart Beat I love you with so much of my heart that none is left to protest Bene Come bid me do anything for thee Beat Kill Claudio Bene Ha not for the wide world Beat You kill me to deny it Farewell Bene Tarry sweet Beatrice Beat I am gone though I am here There is no love in you Nay I pray you let me go Bene Beatrice Beat In faith I will go Bene We'll be friends first Beat You dare easier be friends with me than fight with mine enemy Bene Is Claudio thine enemy Beat Is 'a not approved in the height a villain that hath slandered scorned dishonoured my kinswoman O that I were a man What bear her in hand until they come to take hands and then with public accusation uncover'd slander unmitigated rancourO God that I were a man I would eat his heart in the market place Bene Hear me Beatrice Beat Talk with a man out at a windowa proper saying Bene Nay but Beatrice Beat Sweet Hero she is wrong'd she is sland'red she is undone Bene Beat Beat Princes and Counties Surely a princely testimony a goodly count Count Comfect a sweet gallant surely O that I were a man for his sake or that I had any friend would be a man for my sake But manhood is melted into cursies valour into compliment and men are only turn'd into tongue and trim ones too He is now as valiant as Hercules that only tells a lieand swears it I cannot be a man with wishing therefore I will die a woman with grieving Bene Tarry good Beatrice By this hand I love thee Beat Use it for my love some other way than swearing by it Bene Think you in your soul the Count Claudio hath wrong'd Hero Beat Yea as sure is I have a thought or a soul Bene Enough I am engag'd I will challenge him I will kiss your hand and so I leave you By this hand Claudio shall render me a dear account As you hear of me so think of me Go comfort your cousin I must say she is deadand so farewellSceneA prisonthe Constables Dogberry and Verges and the
