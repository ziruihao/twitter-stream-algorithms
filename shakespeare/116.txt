went into the field have seen her rise from her bed throw her nightgown upon her unlock her closet take forth paper fold it write upon't read it afterwards seal it and again return to bed yet all this while in a most fast sleepA great perturbation in nature to receive at once the benefit of sleep and do the effects of watching In this slumbery agitation besides her walking and other actual performances what at any time have you heard her sayThat sir which I will not report after herYou may to me and 'tis most meet you shouldNeither to you nor anyone having no witness to confirm my

cry is still They come Our castle's strength Will laugh a siege to scorn Here let them lie Till famine and the ague eat them up Were they not forced with those that should be ours We might have met them dareful beard to beard And beat them backward home A cry of women within What is that noiseIt is the cry of women my good lordI have almost forgot the taste of fears The time has been my senses would have cool'd To hear a nightshriek and my fell of hair Would at a dismal treatise rouse and stir As life were in't I have supp'd full with horrors Direness familiar to my slaughterous thoughts Cannot once start me Re SeytonWherefore was that cryThe Queen my lord is deadShe should have died hereafter There would have been a time for such a word Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow Creeps in this petty pace from day to day To the last syllable of recorded time And all our yesterdays have lighted fools The way to dusty death Out out brief candle Life's but a walking shadow a poor player That struts and frets his hour upon the stage And then is heard no more It is a tale Told by an idiot full of sound and fury Signifying nothing a Messenger Thou comest to use thy tongue thy story quicklyGracious my lord I should report that which I say I saw But know not how to do itWell say sirAs I did stand my watch upon the hill I look'd toward Birnam and anon methought The Wood began to moveLiar and slaveLet me endure your wrath if't be not so Within this three mile may you see it coming I say a moving groveIf thou speak'st false Upon the next tree shalt thou hang alive Till famine cling thee if thy speech be sooth I care not if thou dost for me as much I pull in resolution and begin To doubt the equivocation of the fiend That lies like truth Fear not till Birnam Wood Do come to Dunsinane and now a wood Comes toward Dunsinane Arm arm and out If this which he avouches does appear There is nor flying hence nor tarrying here I 'gin to be aweary of the sun And wish the estate o'
