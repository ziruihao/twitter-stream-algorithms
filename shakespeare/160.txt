so pale Lord Dorset as the restAy my good lord and no man in the presence But his red colour hath forsook his cheeksIs Clarence dead The order was revers'dBut he poor man by your first order died And that a winged Mercury did bear Some tardy cripple bare the countermand That came too lag to see him buried God grant that some less noble and less loyal Nearer in bloody thoughts an not in blood Deserve not worse than wretched Clarence did And yet go current from suspicion A boon my sovereign for my service doneI prithee peace my soul is full of sorrowI Will not rise unless your Highness hear meThen say at once what is it thou requestsThe forfeit sovereign of my servant's life Who slew today a riotous gentleman Lately attendant on the Duke of NorfolkHave I a tongue to doom my brother's death And shall that tongue give pardon to a slave My brother killed no manhis fault was thought And yet his punishment was bitter death Who sued to me for him Who in my wrath Kneel'd at my feet and bid me be advis'd Who spoke of brotherhood Who spoke of love Who told me how the poor soul did forsake The mighty Warwick and did fight for me Who told me in the field at Tewksbury When Oxford had me down he rescued me And said 'Dear Brother live and be a king' Who told me when we both lay in the field Frozen almost to death how he did lap me Even in his garments and did give himself All thin and naked to the numb cold night All this from my remembrance brutish wrath Sinfully pluck'd and not a man of you Had so much race to put it in my mind But when your carters or your waitingvassals Have done a drunken slaughter and defac'd The precious image of our dear Redeemer You straight are on your knees for pardon pardon And I unjustly too must grant it yourises But for my brother not a man would speak Nor I ungracious speak unto myself For him poor soul The proudest of you all Have been beholding to him in his life Yet none of you would once beg for his life O God I fear thy justice will take hold On me and you and mine and yours for this Come Hastings help me to my closet Ah poor Clarence some with and This is the fruits of rashness Mark'd you not How that the guilty kindred of the Queen Look'd pale when they did hear of Clarence' death O they did urge it still unto the King God will revenge it Come lords will you go To comfort Edward with our companyWe wait upon your Grace London The palacethe old with the and of Good grandam tell us is our father deadNo boyWhy do you weep so oft and beat your breast And cry 'O Clarence my unhappy son'Why do you look on us and shake your head And call us orphans wretches castaways If that our noble father were aliveMy pretty cousins you mistake me both I do lament the sickness of the King As loath to lose him not your father's death It were lost sorrow to wail one that's lostThen you conclude my grandam he is dead The King mine uncle is to blame for it God will revenge it whom I will importune With earnest prayers all to that effectAnd so will Peace children peace The King doth love you well Incapable and shallow innocents You cannot guess who caus'd your father's deathGrandam we can for my good uncle Gloucester Told me the King provok'd to it by the Queen Devis'd impeachments to imprison him And when my uncle told me so he wept And pitied me and kindly kiss'd my cheek Bade me rely on him as on my father And he would love me dearly as a childAh that deceit should steal such gentle shape And with a virtuous vizor hide deep vice He is my son ay and therein my shame Yet from my dugs he drew not this deceitThink you my uncle did dissemble grandamAy boyI cannot think it Hark what noise is this with her hair about her ears and after herAh who shall hinder me to wail and weep To chide my fortune and torment myself I'll join with black despair against my soul And to myself become an enemyWhat means this scene of rude impatienceTo make an act of tragic violencemy lord thy son our king is dead Why grow the branches when the root is gone Why wither not the leaves that want their sap If you will live lament if die be brief That our swiftwinged souls may catch the King's Or like obedient subjects follow him To his new kingdom of ne'erchanging nightAh so much interest have I in thy sorrow As I had title in thy noble husband I have bewept a worthy husband's death And liv'd with looking on his images But now two mirrors of his princely semblance Are crack'd in pieces by malignant death And I for comfort have but one false glass That grieves me when I see my shame in him Thou art a widow yet thou art a mother And hast the comfort of thy children left But death hath snatch'd my husband from mine arms And pluck'd two crutches from my feeble hands Clarence and Edward O what cause have I Thine being but a moiety of my moan To overgo thy woes and drown thy criesAh aunt you wept not for our father's death How can we aid you with our kindred tearsOur fatherless distress was left unmoan'd Your widowdolour likewise be unweptGive me no help in lamentation I am not barren to bring forth complaints All springs reduce their currents to mine eyes That I being govern'd by the watery moon May send forth plenteous tears to drown the world Ah for my husband for my dear Lord EdwardAh for our father for our dear Lord ClarenceAlas for both both mine Edward and ClarenceWhat stay had I but Edward and he's goneWhat stay had we but Clarence and he's goneWhat stays had I but they and they are goneWas never widow had so dear a lossWere never orphans had so dear a lossWas never mother had so dear a loss Alas I am the mother of these griefs Their woes are parcell'd mine is general She for an Edward weeps and so do I I for a Clarence weep so doth not she These babes for Clarence weep and so do I I for an Edward weep so do not they Alas you three on me threefold distress'd Pour all your tears I am your sorrow's nurse And I will pamper it with lamentationComfort dear mother God is much displeas'd That you take with unthankfulness his doing In common worldly things 'tis called ungrateful With dull unwillingness to repay a debt Which with a bounteous hand was kindly lent Much more to be thus opposite with heaven For it requires the royal debt it lent youMadam bethink you like a careful mother Of the young prince your son Send straight for him Let him be crown'd in him your comfort lives Drown desperate sorrow in dead Edward's grave And plant your joys in living Edward's throne and Sister have comfort All of us have cause To wail the dimming of our shining star But none can help our harms by wailing them Madam my mother I do cry you mercy I did not see your Grace Humbly on my knee I crave your blessingGod bless thee and put meekness in thy breast Love charity obedience and true dutyAmenAsideAnd make me die a good old man That is the butt end of a mother's blessing I marvel that her Grace did leave it outYou cloudy princes and heartsorrowing peers That bear this heavy mutual load of moan Now cheer each other in each other's love Though we have spent our harvest of this king We are to reap the harvest of his son The broken rancour of your highswol'n hearts But lately splinter'd knit and join'd together Must gently be preserv'd cherish'd and kept Me seemeth good that with some little train Forthwith from Ludlow the young prince be fet Hither to London to be crown'd our King Why with some little train my Lord of BuckinghamMarry my lord lest by a multitude The newheal'd wound of malice should break out Which would be so much the more dangerous By how much the estate is green and yet ungovern'd Where every horse bears his commanding rein And may direct his course as please himself As well the fear of harm as harm apparent In my opinion ought to be preventedI hope the King made peace with all of us And the compact is firm and true in meAnd so in me and so I think in an Yet since it is but green it should be put To no apparent likelihood of breach Which haply by much company might be urg'd Therefore I say with noble Buckingham That it is meet so few should fetch the PrinceAnd so say Then be it so and go we to determine Who they shall be that straight shall post to Ludlow Madam and you my sister will you go To give your censures in this businessall but and My lord whoever journeys to the Prince For God sake let not us two stay at home For by the way I'll sort occasion As index to the story we late talk'd of To part the Queen's proud kindred from the PrinceMy other self my counsel's consistory My oracle my prophet my dear cousin I as a child will go by thy direction Toward Ludlow then for we'll not stay behind London A streetone at one door and another at the otherGood morrow neighbour Whither away so fastI promise you I scarcely know myself Hear you the news abroadYes that the King is deadIll news by'r lady seldom comes the better I fear I fear 'twill prove a giddy worldanother Neighbours God speedGive you good morrow sirDoth the news hold of good King Edward's deathAy sir it is too true God help the whileThen masters look to see a troublous worldNo no by God's good grace his son shall reignWoe to that land that's govern'd by a childIn him there is a hope of government Which in his nonage council under him And in his full and ripened years himself No doubt shall then and till then govern wellSo stood the state when Henry the Sixth Was crown'd in Paris but at nine months oldStood the state so No no good friends God wot For then this land was famously enrich'd With politic grave counsel then the King Had virtuous uncles to protect his GraceWhy so hath this both by his father and motherBetter it were they all came by his father Or by his father there were none at all For emulation who shall now be nearest Will touch us all too near if God prevent not O full of danger is the Duke of Gloucester And the Queen's sons and brothers haught and proud And were they to be rul'd and not to rule This sickly land might solace as beforeCome come we fear the worst all will be wellWhen clouds are seen wise men put on their cloaks When great leaves fall then winter is at hand When the sun sets who doth not look for night Untimely storms make men expect a dearth All may be well but if God sort it so 'Tis more than we deserve or I expectTruly the hearts of men are fun of fear You cannot reason almost with a man That looks not heavily and fun of dreadBefore the days of change still is it so By a divine instinct men's minds mistrust Ensuing danger as by proof we see The water swell before a boist'rous storm But leave it all to God Whither awayMarry we were sent for to the justicesAnd so was I I'll bear you companyLondon The palacethe the youngand theLast night I hear they lay at Stony Stratford And at Northampton they do rest tonight Tomorrow or next day they will be hereI long with all my heart to see the Prince I hope he is much grown since last I saw himBut I hear no they say my son of York Has almost overta'en him in his growthAy mother but I would not have it soWhy my good cousin it is good to growGrandam one night as we did sit at supper My uncle Rivers talk'd how I did grow More than my brother 'Ay' quoth my uncle Gloucester mall herbs have grace great weeds do grow apace' And since methinks I would not grow so fast Because sweet flow'rs are slow and weeds make hasteGood faith good faith the saying did not hold In him that did object the same to thee He was the wretched'st thing when he was young So long agrowing and so leisurely That if his rule were true he should be graciousAnd so no doubt he is my gracious madamI hope he is but yet let mothers doubtNow by my troth if I had been rememb'red I could have given my uncle's Grace a flout To touch his growth nearer than he touch'd mineHow my young York I prithee let me hear itMarry they say my uncle grew so fast That he could gnaw a crust at two hours old 'Twas full two years ere I could get a tooth Grandam this would have been a biting jestI prithee pretty York who told thee thisGrandam his nurseHis nurse Why she was dead ere thou wast bornIf 'twere not she I cannot tell who told meA parlous boy Go to you are too shrewdGood madam be not angry with the childPitchers have earsa Here comes a messenger What newsSuch news my lord as grieves me to reportHow doth the PrinceWell madam and in healthWhat is thy newsLord Rivers and Lord Grey Are sent to Pomfret and with them Sir Thomas Vaughan prisonersWho hath committed themThe mighty Dukes Gloucester and BuckinghamFor what offenceThe sum of all I can I have disclos'd Why or for what the nobles were committed Is all unknown to me my gracious lordAy me I see the ruin of my house The tiger now hath seiz'd the gentle hind Insulting tyranny begins to jet Upon the innocent and aweless throne Welcome destruction blood and massacre I see as in a map the end of allAccursed and unquiet wrangling days How many of you have mine eyes beheld My husband lost his life to get the crown And often up and down my sons were toss'd For me to joy and weep their gain and loss And being seated and domestic broils Clean overblown themselves the conquerors Make war upon themselvesbrother to brother Blood to blood self against self O preposterous And frantic outrage end thy damned spleen Or let me die to look on death no moreCome come my boy we will to sanctuary Madam farewellStay I will go with youYou have no cause To the My gracious lady go And thither bear your treasure and your goods For my part I'll resign unto your Grace The seal I keep and so betide to me As well I tender you and all of yours Go I'll conduct you to the sanctuary
