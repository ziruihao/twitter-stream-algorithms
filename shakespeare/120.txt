The prison disguised as beforeand So then you hope of pardon from Lord AngeloThe miserable have no other medicine But only hope I have hope to Eve and am prepar'd to dieBe absolute for death either death or life Shall thereby be the sweeter Reason thus with life If I do lose thee I do lose a thing That none but fools would keep A breath thou art Servile to all the skyey influences That dost this habitation where thou keep'st Hourly afflict Merely thou art Death's fool For him thou labour'st by thy flight to shun And yet run'st toward him still Thou art not noble For all th' accommodations that thou bear'st Are nurs'd by baseness Thou 'rt by no means valiant For thou dost fear the soft and tender fork Of a poor worm Thy best of rest is sleep And that thou oft provok'st yet grossly fear'st Thy death which is no more Thou art not thyself For thou exists on many a thousand grains That issue out of dust Happy thou art not For what thou hast not still thou striv'st to get And what thou hast forget'st Thou art not certain For thy complexion shifts to strange effects After the moon If thou art rich thou'rt poor For like an ass whose back with ingots bows Thou bear'st thy heavy riches but a journey And Death unloads thee Friend hast thou none For thine own bowels which do call thee sire The mere effusion of thy proper loins Do curse the gout serpigo and the rheum For ending thee no sooner Thou hast nor youth nor age But as it were an afterdinner's sleep Dreaming on both for all thy blessed youth Becomes as aged and doth beg the alms Of palsied eld and when thou art old and rich Thou hast neither heat affection limb nor beauty To make thy riches pleasant What's yet in this That bears the name of life Yet in this life Lie hid moe thousand deaths yet death we fear That makes these odds all evenI humbly thank you To sue to live I find I seek to die And seeking death find life Let it come onWithin What ho Peace here grace and good companyWho's there Come in the wish deserves a welcomeDear sir ere long I'll visit you againMost holy sir I thank youMy business is a word or two with ClaudioAnd very welcome Look signior here's your sisterProvost a word with youAs many as you pleaseBring me to hear them speak where I may be conceal'd Now sister what's the comfortWhy As all comforts are most good most good indeed Lord Angelo having affairs to heaven Intends you for his swift ambassador Where you shall be an everlasting leiger Therefore your best appointment make with speed Tomorrow you set onIs there no remedyNone but such remedy as to save a head To cleave a heart in twainBut is there anyYes brother you may live There is a devilish mercy in the judge If you'll implore it that will free your life But fetter you till deathPerpetual duranceAy just perpetual durance a restraint Though all the world's vastidity you had To a determin'd scopeBut in what natureIn such a one as you consenting to't Would bark your honour from that trunk you bear And leave you nakedLet me know the pointO I do fear thee Claudio and I quake Lest thou a feverous life shouldst tain And six or seven winters more respect Than a perpetual honour Dar'st thou die The sense of death is most in apprehension And the poor beetle that we tread upon In corporal sufferance finds a pang as great As when a giant diesWhy give you me this shame Think you I can a resolution fetch From flow'ry tenderness If I must die I will encounter darkness as a bride And hug it in mine armsThere spake my brother there my father's grave Did utter forth a voice Yes thou must die Thou art too noble to conserve a life In base appliances This outwardsainted deputy Whose settled visage and deliberate word Nips youth i' th' head and follies doth enew As falcon doth the fowl is yet a devil His filth within being cast he would appear A pond as deep as hellThe precise AngeloO 'tis the cunning livery of hell The damned'st body to invest and cover In precise guards Dost thou think Claudio If I would yield him my virginity Thou mightst be freedO heavens it cannot beYes he would give't thee from this rank offence So to offend him still This night's the time That I should do what I abhor to name Or else thou diest tomorrowThou shalt not do'tO were it but my life I'd throw it down for your deliverance As frankly as a pinThanks dear IsabelBe ready Claudio for your death tomorrowYes Has he affections in him That thus can make him bite the law by th' nose When he would force it Sure it is no sin Or of the deadly seven it is the leastWhich is the leastIf it were damnable he being so wise Why would he for the momentary trick Be perdurably fin'd O IsabelWhat says my brotherDeath is a fearful thingAnd shamed life a hatefulAy but to die and go we know not where To lie in cold obstruction and to rot This sensible warm motion to become A kneaded clod and the delighted spirit To bathe in fiery floods or to reside In thrilling region of thickribbed ice To be imprison'd in the viewless winds And blown with restless violence round about The pendent world or to be worse than worst Of those that lawless and incertain thought Imagine howling 'tis too horrible The weariest and most loathed worldly life That age ache penury and imprisonment Can lay on nature is a paradise To what we fear of deathAlas alasSweet sister let me live What sin you do to save a brother's life Nature dispenses with the deed so far That it becomes a virtueO you beast O faithless coward O dishonest wretch Wilt thou be made a man out of my vice Is't not a kind of incest to take life From thine own sister's shame What should I think Heaven shield my mother play'd my father fair For such a warped slip of wilderness Ne'er issu'd from his blood Take my defiance Die perish Might but my bending down Reprieve thee from thy fate it should proceed I'll pray a thousand prayers for thy death No word to save theeNay hear me IsabelO fie fie fie Thy sin's not accidental but a trade Mercy to thee would prove itself a bawd 'Tis best that thou diest quicklyO hear me Isabella Re Vouchsafe a word young sister but one wordWhat is your willMight you dispense with your leisure I would by and by have some speech with you the satisfaction I would require is likewise your own benefitI have no superfluous leisure my stay must be stolen out of other affairs but I will attend you awhileWalks apartSon I have overheard what hath pass'd between you and your sister Angelo had never the purpose to corrupt her only he hath made an assay of her virtue to practise his judgment with the disposition of natures She having the truth of honour in her hath made him that gracious denial which he is most glad to receive I am confessor to Angelo and I know this to be true therefore prepare yourself to death Do not satisfy your resolution with hopes that are fallible tomorrow you must die go to your knees and make readyLet me ask my sister pardon I am so out of love with life that I will sue to be rid of itHold you there Farewell Provost a word with you Re What's your will fatherThat now you are come you will be gone Leave me a while with the maid my mind promises with my habit no loss shall touch her by my companyIn good time The hand that hath made you fair hath made you good the goodness that is cheap in beauty makes beauty brief in goodness but grace being the soul of your complexion shall keep the body of it ever fair The assault that Angelo hath made to you fortune hath convey'd to my understanding and but that frailty hath examples for his falling I should wonder at Angelo How will you do to content this substitute and to save your brotherI am now going to resolve him I had rather my brother die by the law than my son should be unlawfully born But O how much is the good Duke deceiv'd in Angelo If ever he return and I can speak to him I will open my lips in vain or discover his governmentThat shall not be much amiss yet as the matter now stands he will avoid your accusation he made trial of you only Therefore fasten your ear on my advisings to the love I have in doing good a remedy presents itself I do make myself believe that you may most uprighteously do a poor wronged lady a merited benefit redeem your brother from the angry law do no stain to your own gracious person and much please the absent Duke if peradventure he shall ever return to have hearing of this businessLet me hear you speak farther I have spirit to do anything that appears not foul in the truth of my spiritVirtue is bold and goodness never fearful Have you not heard speak of Mariana the sister of Frederick the great soldier who miscarried at seaI have heard of the lady and good words went with her nameShe should this Angelo have married was affianced to her by oath and the nuptial appointed between which time of the contract and limit of the solemnity her brother Frederick was wreck'd at sea having in that perished vessel the dowry of his sister But mark how heavily this befell to the poor gentlewoman there she lost a noble and renowned brother in his love toward her ever most kind and natural with him the portion and sinew of her fortune her marriagedowry with both her combinate husband this wellseeming AngeloCan this be so Did Angelo so leave herLeft her in her tears and dried not one of them with his comfort swallowed his vows whole pretending in her discoveries of dishonour in few bestow'd her on her own lamentation which she yet wears for his sake and he a marble to her tears is washed with them but relents notWhat a merit were it in death to take this poor maid from the world What corruption in this life that it will let this man live But how out of this can she availIt is a rupture that you may easily heal and the cure of it not only saves your brother but keeps you from dishonour in doing itShow me how good fatherThis forenamed maid hath yet in her the continuance of her first affection his unjust unkindness that in all reason should have quenched her love hath like an impediment in the current made it more violent and unruly Go you to Angelo answer his requiring with a plausible obedience agree with his demands to the point only refer yourself to this advantage first that your stay with him may not be long that the time may have all shadow and silence in it and the place answer to convenience This being granted in course and now follows all we shall advise this wronged maid to stead up your appointment go in your place If the encounter acknowledge itself hereafter it may compel him to her recompense and here by this is your brother saved your honour untainted the poor Mariana advantaged and the corrupt deputy scaled The maid will I frame and make fit for his attempt If you think well to carry this as you may the doubleness of the benefit defends the deceit from reproof What think you of itThe image of it gives me content already and I trust it will grow to a most prosperous perfectionIt lies much in your holding up Haste you speedily to Angelo if for this night he entreat you to his bed give him promise of satisfaction I will presently to Saint Luke's there at the moated grange resides this dejected Mariana At that place

Pompey goandWhat news friar of the DukeI know none Can you tell me of anySome say he is with the Emperor of Russia other some he is in Rome but where is he think youI know not where but wheresoever I wish him wellIt was a mad fantastical trick of him to steal from the state and usurp the beggary he was never born to Lord Angelo dukes it well in his absence he puts transgression to'tHe does well in'tA little more lenity to lechery would do no harm in him something too crabbed that way friarIt is too general a vice and severity must cure itYes in good sooth the vice is of a great kindred it is well allied but it is impossible to extirp it quite friar till eating and drinking be put down They say this Angelo was not made by man and woman after this downright way of creation Is it true think youHow should he be made thenSome report a seamaid spawn'd him some that he was begot between two stockfishes But it is certain that when he makes water his urine is congeal'd ice that I know to be true And he is a motion generative that's infallibleYou are pleasant sir and speak apaceWhy what a ruthless thing is this in him for the rebellion of a codpiece to take away the life of a man Would the Duke that is absent have done this Ere he would have hang'd a man for the getting a hundred bastards he would have paid for the nursing a thousand He had some feeling of the sport he knew the service and that instructed him to mercyI never heard the absent Duke much detected for women he was not inclin'd that wayO sir you are deceiv'd'Tis not possibleWho not the Duke Yes your beggar of fifty and his use was to put a ducat in her clackdish The Duke had crotchets in him He would be drunk too that let me inform youYou do him wrong surelySir I was an inward of his A shy fellow was the Duke and I believe I know the cause of his withdrawingWhat I prithee might be the causeNo pardon 'tis a secret must be lock'd within the teeth and the lips but this I can let you understand the greater file of the subject held the Duke to be wiseWise Why no question but he wasA very superficial ignorant unweighing fellowEither this is envy in you folly or mistaking the very stream of his life and the business he hath helmed must upon a warranted need give him a better proclamation Let him be but testimonied in his own bringingsforth and he shall appear to the envious a scholar a statesman and a soldier Therefore you speak unskilfully or if your knowledge be more it is much dark'ned in your maliceSir I know him and I love himLove talks with better knowledge and knowledge with dearer loveCome sir I know what I knowI can hardly believe that since you know not what you speak But if ever the Duke return as our prayers are he may let me desire you to make your answer before him If it be honest you have spoke you have courage to maintain it I am bound to call upon you and I pray you your nameSir my name is Lucio well known to the DukeHe shall know you better sir if I may live to report youI fear you notO you hope the Duke will return no more or you imagine me too unhurtful an opposite But indeed I can do you little harm you'll forswear this againI'll be hang'd first Thou art deceiv'd in me friar But no more of this Canst thou tell if Claudio die tomorrow or noWhy should he die sirWhy For filling a bottle with a tundish I would the Duke we talk of were return'd again This ungenitur'd agent will unpeople the province with continency sparrows must not build in his houseeaves because they are lecherous The Duke yet would have dark deeds darkly answered he would never bring them to light Would he were return'd Marry this Claudio is condemned for untrussing Farewell good friar I prithee pray for me The Duke I say to thee again would eat mutton on Fridays He's not past it yet and I say to thee he would mouth with a beggar though she smelt brown bread and garlic Say that I said so Farewell No might nor greatness in mortality Can censure scape backwounding calumny The whitest virtue strikes What king so strong Can tie the gall up in the slanderous tongue But who comes here and withGo away with her to prison Good my lord be good to me your honour is accounted a merciful man good my lordDouble and treble admonition and still forfeit in the same kind This would make mercy swear and play the tyrantA bawd of eleven years' continuance may it please your honour My lord this is one Lucio's information against me Mistress Kate Keepdown was with child by him in the Duke's time he promis'd her marriage His child is a year and a quarter old come Philip and Jacob I have kept it myself and see how he goes about to abuse meThat fellow is a fellow of much license Let him be call'd before us Away with her to prison Go to no more wordswith Provost my brother Angelo will not be alter'd Claudio must die tomorrow Let him be furnish'd with divines and have all charitable preparation If my brother wrought by my pity it should not be so with himSo please you this friar hath been with him and advis'd him for th' tainment of deathGood even good fatherBliss and goodness on youOf whence are youNot of this country though my chance is now To use it for my time I am a brother Of gracious order late come from the See In special business from his HolinessWhat news abroad i' th' worldNone but that there is so great a fever on goodness that the dissolution of it must cure it Novelty is only in request and as it is as dangerous to be aged in any kind of course as it is virtuous to be constant in any undertakeing There is scarce truth enough alive to make societies secure but security enough to make fellowships accurst Much upon this riddle runs the wisdom of the world This news is old enough yet it is every day's news I pray you sir of what disposition was the DukeOne that above all other strifes contended especially to know himselfWhat pleasure was he given toRather rejoicing to see another merry than merry at anything which profess'd to make him rejoice a gentleman of all temperance But leave we him to his events with a prayer they may prove prosperous and let me desire to know how you find Claudio prepar'd I am made to understand that you have lent him visitationHe professes to have received no sinister measure from his judge but most willingly humbles himself to the determination of justice Yet had he framed to himself by the instruction of his frailty many deceiving promises of life which I by my good leisure have discredited to him and now he is resolv'd to dieYou have paid the heavens your function and the prisoner the very debt of your calling I have labour'd for the poor gentleman to the extremest shore of my modesty but my brother justice have I found so severe that he hath forc'd me to tell him he is indeed JusticeIf his own life answer the straitness of his proceeding it shall become him well wherein if he chance to fail he hath sentenc'd himselfI am going to visit the prisoner Fare you wellPeace be with you He who the sword of heaven will bearShould be as holy as severePattern in himself to knowGrace to stand and virtue goMore nor less to others payingThan by selfoffences

so musical Let me excuse me and believe me so My mirth it much displeas'd but pleas'd my woe'Tis good though music oft hath such a charm To make bad good and good provoke to harm I pray you tell me

favour you have but that you have a hanging look do you call sir your occupation a mysteryAy sir a mysteryPainting sir I have heard say is a mystery and your whores sir being members of my occupation

be too little for your thief your true man thinks it big enough if it be too big for your thief your thief thinks it little enough so every true man's apparel fits your thief Re Are you agreedSir I will serve him for I do find your hangman is a more penitent trade than your bawd he doth oftener ask forgivenessYou sirrah provide your block and your axe tomorrow four o'clockCome on bawd I will instruct thee in my trade followI do desire to learn sir and I hope if you have occasion to use me for your own turn you shall find me yare for truly sir for your kindness I owe you a good turnCall

prepare yourself Knocking within But hark what noise Heaven give your spirits comfort Knocking continues By and by I hope it is some pardon or reprieve For the most gentle Claudiodisguised as before Welcome fatherThe best and wholesom'st spirits of the night Envelop you good Provost Who call'd here of lateNone since the curfew rungNot IsabelNoThey will then ere't be longWhat comfort is for ClaudioThere's some in hopeIt is a bitter deputyNot so not so his life is parallel'd Even with the stroke and line of his great justice He doth with holy abstinence subdue That in himself which he spurs on his pow'r To qualify in others Were he meal'd with that Which he corrects then were he tyrannous But this being so he's just Knocking within Now are they come This is a gentle provost seldom when The steeled gaoler is the friend of men Knocking within How now what noise That spirit's possess'd with haste That wounds th' unsisting postern with these strokes Re There he must stay until the officer Arise to let him in he is call'd upHave you no countermand for Claudio yet But he must die tomorrowNone sir noneAs near the dawning Provost as it is You shall hear more ere morningHappily You something know yet I believe there comes No countermand no such example have we Besides upon the very siege of justice Lord Angelo hath to the public ear Profess'd the contrary aThis is his lordship's manAnd here comes Claudio's pardonMy lord hath sent you this note and by me this further charge that you swerve not from the smallest article of it neither in time matter or other circumstance Good morrow for as I take it it is almost dayI shall obey him Aside This is his pardon purchas'd by such sin For which the pardoner himself is in Hence hath offence his quick celerity When it is borne in high authority When vice makes mercy mercy's so extended That for the fault's love is th' offender friended Now sir what newsI told you Lord Angelo belike thinking me remiss in mine office awakens me with this unwonted puttingon methinks strangely for he hath not us'd it beforePray you let's hearReads 'Whatsoever you may hear to the contrary let Claudio be executed by four of the clock and in the afternoon Barnardine For my better satisfaction let me have Claudio's head sent me by five Let this be duly performed with a thought that more depends on it than we must yet deliver Thus fail not to do your office as you will answer it at your peril' What say you to this sirWhat is that Barnardine who is to be executed in th' afternoonA Bohemian born but here nurs'd up and bred One that is a prisoner nine years oldHow came it that the absent Duke had not either deliver'd him to his liberty or executed him I have heard it was ever his manner to do soHis friends still wrought reprieves for him and indeed his fact till now in the government of Lord Angelo came not to an undoubted proofIt is now apparentMost manifest and not denied by himselfHath he borne himself penitently in prison How seems he to be touch'dA man that apprehends death no more dreadfully but as a drunken sleep careless reckless and fearless of what's past present or to come insensible of mortality and desperately mortalHe wants adviceHe will hear none He hath evermore had the liberty of the prison give him leave to escape hence he would not drunk many times a day if not many days entirely drunk We have very oft awak'd him as if to carry him to execution and show'd him a seeming warrant for it it hath not moved him at allMore of him anon There is written in your brow Provost honesty and constancy If I read it not truly my ancient skill beguiles me but in the boldness of my cunning I will lay myself in hazard Claudio whom here you have warrant to execute is no greater forfeit to the law than Angelo who hath sentenc'd him To make you understand this in a manifested effect I crave but four days' respite for the which you are to do me both a present and a dangerous courtesyPray sir in whatIn the delaying deathAlack How may I do it having the hour limited and an express command under penalty to deliver his head in the view of Angelo I may make my case as Claudio's to cross this in the smallestBy the vow of mine order I warrant you if my instructions may be your guide Let this Barnardine be this morning executed and his head borne to AngeloAngelo hath seen them both and will discover the favourO death's a great disguiser and you may add to it Shave the head and tie the beard and say it was the desire of the penitent to be so bar'd before his death You know the course is common If anything fall to you upon this more than thanks and good fortune by the saint whom I profess I will plead against it with my lifePardon me good father it is against my oathWere you sworn to the Duke or to the deputyTo him and to his substitutesYou will think you have made no offence if the Duke avouch the justice of your dealingBut what likelihood is in thatNot a resemblance but a certainty Yet since I see you fearful that neither my coat integrity nor persuasion can with ease attempt you I will go further than I meant to pluck all fears out of you Look you sir here is the hand and seal of the Duke You know the character I doubt not and the signet is not strange to youI know them bothThe contents of this is the return of the Duke you shall anon overread it at your pleasure where you shall find within these two days he will be here This is a thing that Angelo knows not for he this very day receives letters of strange tenour perchance of the Duke's death perchance ing into some monastery but by chance nothing of what is writ Look th' unfolding star calls up the shepherd Put not yourself into amazement how these things should be all difficulties are but easy when they are known Call your executioner and off with Barnardine's head I will give him a present shrift and advise him for a better place Yet you are amaz'd but this shall absolutely resolve you Come away it is almost clear dawn The prisonI am as well acquainted here as I was in our house of profession one would think it were Mistress Overdone's own house for here be many of her old customers

Forbear it therefore give your cause to heaven Mark what I say which you shall find By every syllable a faithful verity The Duke comes home tomorrow Nay dry your eyes One of our covent and his confessor Gives me this instance Already he hath carried Notice to Escalus and Angelo Who do prepare to meet him at the gates There to give up their pow'r If you can pace your wisdom In that good path that I would wish it go And you shall have your bosom on this wretch Grace of the Duke revenges to your heart And general honourI am directed by youThis letter then to Friar Peter give 'Tis that he sent me of the Duke's return Say by this token I desire his company At Mariana's house tonight Her cause and yours I'll perfect him withal and he shall bring you Before the Duke and to the head of Angelo Accuse him home and home For my poor self I am combined by a sacred vow And shall be absent Wend you with this letter Command these fretting waters from your eyes With a light heart trust not my holy order If I pervert your course Who's here Good even Friar where's the ProvostNot within sirO pretty Isabella I am pale at mine heart to see thine eyes so red Thou must be patient I am fain to dine and sup with water and bran I dare not for my head fill my belly one fruitful meal would set me to't But they say the Duke will be here tomorrow By my troth Isabel I lov'd thy brother If the old fantastical Duke of dark corners had been at home he had livedSir the Duke is marvellous little beholding to your reports but the best is he lives not in themFriar thou knowest not the Duke so well as I do he's a better woodman than thou tak'st him forWell you'll answer this one day Fare ye wellNay tarry I'll go along with thee I can tell thee pretty tales of the DukeYou have told me too many of him already sir if they be true if not true none were enoughI was once before him for getting a wench with childDid you such a thingYes marry did I but I was fain to forswear it they would else have married me to the rotten medlarSir your company is fairer than honest Rest you wellBy my troth I'll go with thee to the lane's end If bawdy talk offend you we'll have very little of it Nay friar I am a kind of burr I shall stick houseand Every letter he hath writ hath disvouch'd otherIn most uneven and distracted manner His actions show much like to madness pray heaven his wisdom be not tainted And why meet him at the gates and redeliver our authorities thereI guess notAnd why should we proclaim it in an hour before his ent'ring that if any crave redress of injustice they should exhibit their petitions in the streetHe shows his reason for that to have a dispatch ofcomplaints and to deliver us from devices hereafter which shall then have no power to stand against usWell I beseech you let it be proclaim'd Betimes i' th' morn I'll call you at your house Give notice to such men of sort and suit As are to meet himI shall sir fare you wellGood night This deed unshapes me quite makes me unpregnant And dull to all proceedings A deflow'red maid And by an eminent body that enforc'd The law against it But that her tender shame Will not proclaim against her maiden loss How might she tongue me Yet reason dares her no For my authority bears a so credent bulk That no particular scandal once can touch But it confounds the breather He should have liv'd Save that his riotous youth with dangerous sense Might in the times to come have ta'en revenge By so receiving a dishonour'd life With ransom of such shame Would yet he had liv'd Alack when once our grace we have forgot Nothing goes right we would and we would not Fields without the townin his own habit and Friar These letters at fit time deliver me Giving letters The Provost knows our purpose and our plot The matter being afoot keep your instruction And hold you ever to our special drift Though sometimes you do blench from this to that As cause doth minister Go call at Flavius' house And tell him where I stay give the like notice To Valentinus Rowland and to Crassus And bid them bring the trumpets to the gate But send me Flavius firstIt shall be speeded wellI thank thee Varrius thou hast made good haste Come we will walk There's other of our friends Will greet us here anon My gentle Varrius A street near the city gateand To speak so indirectly I am loath I would say the truth but to accuse him so That is your part Yet I am advis'd to do it He says to veil full purposeBe rul'd by himBesides he tells me that if peradventure He speak against me on the adverse side I should not think it strange for 'tis a physic That's bitter to sweet endI would Friar Peter O peace the friar is comeCome I have found you out a stand most fit Where you may have such vantage on the Duke He shall not pass you Twice have the trumpets sounded The generous and gravest citizens Have hent the gates and very near upon The Duke is ent'ring therefore hence away
