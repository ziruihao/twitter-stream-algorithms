 Rousillon Paris Florence Marseilles Rousillon Thepalace theandall in blackIn delivering my son from me I bury a second husbandAnd I in going madam weep o'er my father's death anew but I must attend his Majesty's command to whom I am now in ward evermore in subjectionYou shall find of the King a husband madam you sir a father He that so generally is at all times good must of necessity hold his virtue to you whose worthiness would stir it up where it wanted rather than lack it where there is such abundanceWhat hope is there of his Majesty's amendmentHe hath abandon'd his physicians madam under whose practices he hath persecuted time with hope and finds no other advantage in the process but only the losing of hope by timeThis young gentlewoman had a father O that 'had' how sad a passage 'tiswhose skill was almost as great as his honesty had it stretch'd so far would have made nature immortal and death should have play for lack of work Would for the King's sake he were living I think it would be the death of the King's diseaseHow call'd you the man you speak of madamHe was famous sir in his profession and it was his great right to be so Gerard de NarbonHe was excellent indeed madam the King very lately spoke of him admiringly and mourningly he was skilful enough to have liv'd still if knowledge could be set up against mortalityWhat is it my good lord the King languishes ofA fistula my lordI heard not of it beforeI would it were not notorious Was this gentlewoman the daughter of Gerard de NarbonHis sole child my lord and bequeathed to my overlooking I have those hopes of her good that her education promises her dispositions she inherits which makes fair gifts fairer for where an unclean mind carries virtuous qualities there commendations go with pitythey are virtues and traitors too In her they are the better for their simpleness she derives her honesty and achieves her goodnessYour commendations madam get from her tears'Tis the best brine a maiden can season her praise in The remembrance of her father never approaches her heart but the tyranny of her sorrows takes all livelihood from her cheek No more of this Helena go to no more lest it be rather thought you affect a sorrow than to haveI do affect a sorrow indeed but I have it tooModerate lamentation is the right of the dead excessive grief the enemy to the livingIf the living be enemy to the grief the excess makes it soon mortalMadam I desire your holy wishesHow understand we thatBe thou blest Bertram and succeed thy father In manners as in shape Thy blood and virtue Contend for empire in thee and thy goodness Share with thy birthright Love all trust a few Do wrong to none be able for thine enemy Rather in power than use and keep thy friend Under thy own life's key be

and make much of herFarewell pretty lady you must hold the credit of your fatherO were that all I think not on my father And these great tears grace his remembrance more Than those I shed for him What was he like I have forgot him my imagination Carries no favour in't but Bertram's I am undone there is no living none If Bertram be away 'Twere all one That I should love a bright particular star And think to wed it he is so above me In his bright radiance and collateral light Must I be comforted not in his sphere Th' ambition in my love thus plagues itself The hind that would be mated by the lion Must die for love 'Twas pretty though a plague To see him every hour to sit and draw His arched brows his hawking eye his curls In our heart's tableheart too capable Of every line and trick of his sweet favour But now he's gone and my idolatrous fancy Must sanctify his relics Who comes hereAsideOne that goes with him I love him for his sake And yet I know him a notorious liar Think him a great way fool solely a coward Yet these fix'd evils sit so fit in him That they take place when virtue's steely bones Looks bleak i' th' cold wind withal full oft we see Cold wisdom waiting on superfluous follySave you fair queenAnd you monarchNoAnd noAre you meditating on virginityAy You have some stain of soldier in you let me ask you a question Man is enemy to virginity how may we barricado it against himKeep him outBut he assails and our virginity though valiant in the defence yet is weak Unfold to us some warlike resistanceThere is none Man setting down before you will undermine you and blow you upBless our poor virginity from underminers and blowersup Is there no military policy how virgins might blow up menVirginity being blown down man will quicklier be blown up marry in blowing him down again with the breach yourselvesmade you lose your city It is not politic in the commonwealth of nature to preserve virginity Loss of virginity is rational increase and there was never virgin got till virginity was first lost That you were made of is metal to make virgins Virginity by being once lost may be ten times found by being ever kept it is ever lost 'Tis too cold a companion away with'tI will stand for 't a little though therefore I die a virginThere's little can be said in 't 'tis against the rule of nature To speak on the part of virginity is to accuse your mothers which is most infallible disobedience He that hangs himself is a virgin virginity murders itself and should be buried in highways out of all sanctified limit as a desperate offendress against nature Virginity breeds mites much like a cheese consumes itself to the very paring and so dies with feeding his own stomach Besides virginity is peevish proud idle made of selflove which is the most inhibited sin in the canon Keep it not you cannot choose but lose by't Out with't Within ten year it will make itself ten which is a goodly increase and the principal itself not much the worse Away with'tHow might one do sir to lose it to her own likingLet me see Marry ill to like him that ne'er it likes 'Tis a commodity will lose the gloss with lying the longer kept the less worth Off with't while 'tis vendible answer the time of request Virginity like an old courtier wears her cap out of fashion richly suited but unsuitable just like the brooch and the toothpick which wear not now Your date is better in your pie and your porridge than in your cheek And your virginity your old virginity is like one of our French wither'd pears it looks ill it eats drily marry 'tis a wither'd pear it was formerly better marry yet 'tis a wither'd pear Will you anything with itNot my virginity yet There shall your master have a thousand loves A mother and a mistress and a friend A phoenix captain and an enemy A guide a goddess and a sovereign A counsellor a traitress and a dear His humble ambition proud humility His jarring concord and his discord dulcet His faith his sweet disaster with a world Of pretty fond adoptious christendoms That blinking Cupid gossips Now shall he I know not what he shall God send him well The court's a learningplace and he is oneWhat one i' faithThat I wish well 'Tis pityWhat's pityThat wishing well had not a body in't Which might be felt that we the poorer born Whose baser stars do shut us up in wishes Might with effects of them follow our friends And show what we alone must think which never Returns us thanksMonsieur Parolles my lord calls for you Little Helen farewell if I can remember thee I will think of thee at courtMonsieur Parolles you were born under a charitable starUnder Mars I especially think under MarsWhy under ManThe wars hath so kept you under that you must needs be born under MarsWhen he was predominantWhen he was retrograde I think ratherWhy think you soYou go so much backward when you fightThat's for advantageSo is running away when fear proposes the safety but the composition that your valour and fear makes in you is a virtue of a good wing and I like the wear wellI am so full of business I cannot answer thee acutely I will return perfect courtier in the which my instruction shall serve to naturalize thee so thou wilt be capable of a courtier's counsel and understand what advice shall thrust upon thee else thou diest in thine unthankfulness and thine ignorance makes thee away Farewell When thou hast leisure say thy prayers when thou hast none remember thy friends Get thee a good husband and use him as he uses thee So farewellOur remedies oft in ourselves do lie Which we ascribe to heaven The fated sky Gives us free scope only doth backward pull Our slow designs when we ourselves are dull What power is it which mounts my love so high That makes me see and cannot feed mine eye The mightiest space in fortune nature brings To join like likes and kiss like native things Impossible be strange attempts to those That weigh their pains in sense and do suppose What hath been cannot be Who ever strove To show her merit that did miss her love The King's diseasemy project may deceive me But my intents are fix'd and will not leave meParis Thepalace Flourish of cornetsthe with letters and divers The Florentines and Senoys are by th' ears Have fought with equal fortune and continue A braving warSo 'tis reported sirNay 'tis most credible We here receive it A certainty vouch'd from our cousin Austria With caution that the Florentine will move us For speedy aid wherein our dearest friend Prejudicates the business and would seem To have us make denialHis love and wisdom Approv'd so to your Majesty may plead For amplest credenceHe hath arm'd our answer And Florence is denied before he comes Yet for our gentlemen that mean to see The Tuscan service freely have they leave To stand on either partIt well may serve A nursery to our gentry who are sick For breathing and exploitWhat's he comes hereand It is the Count Rousillon my good lord Young BertramYouth thou bear'st thy father's face Frank nature rather curious than in haste Hath well compos'd thee Thy father's moral parts Mayst thou inherit too Welcome to ParisMy thanks and duty are your Majesty'sI would I had that corporal soundness now As when thy father and myself in friendship First tried our soldiership He did look far Into the service of the time and was Discipled of the bravest He lasted long But on us both did haggish age steal on And wore us out of act It much repairs me To talk of your good father In his youth He had the wit which I can well observe Today in our young lords but they may jest Till their own scorn return to them unnoted Ere they can hide their levity in honour So like a courtier contempt nor bitterness Were in his pride or sharpness if they were His equal had awak'd them and his honour Clock to itself knew the true minute when Exception bid him speak and at this time His tongue obey'd his hand Who were below him He us'd as creatures of another place And bow'd his eminent top to their low ranks Making them proud of his humility In their poor praise he humbled Such a man Might be a copy to these younger times Which followed well would demonstrate them now But goers backwardHis good remembrance sir Lies richer in your thoughts than on his tomb So in approof lives not his epitaph As in your royal speechWould I were with him He would always say Methinks I hear him now his plausive words He scatter'd not in ears but grafted them To grow there and to bear 'Let me not live' This his good melancholy oft began On the catastrophe and heel of pastime When it was out'Let me not live' quoth he 'After my flame lacks oil to be the snuff Of younger spirits whose apprehensive senses All but new things disdain whose judgments are Mere fathers of their garments whose constancies Expire before their fashions' This he wish'd I after him do after him wish too Since I nor wax nor honey can bring home I quickly were dissolved from my hive To give some labourers roomYou're loved sir They that least lend it you shall lack you firstI fill a place I know't How long is't Count Since the physician at your father's died He was much fam'dSome six months since my lordIf he were living I would

thought I dare vow for her they touch'd not any stranger sense Her matter was she loved your son Fortune she said was no goddess that had put such difference betwixt their two estates Love no god that would not extend his might only where qualities were level Diana no queen of virgins that would suffer her poor knight surpris'd without rescue in the first assault or ransom afterward This she

rose of youth rightly belong Our blood to us this to our blood is born It is the show and seal of nature's truth Where love's strong passion is impress'd in youth By our remembrances of days foregone Such were our faults or then we thought them none Her eye is sick on't I observe her nowWhat is your pleasure madamYou know Helen I am a mother to youMine honourable mistressNay a mother Why not a mother When I said 'a mother' Methought you saw a serpent What's in 'mother' That you start at it I say I am your mother And put you in the catalogue of those That were enwombed mine 'Tis often seen Adoption strives with nature and choice breeds A native slip to us from foreign seeds You ne'er oppress'd me with a mother's groan Yet I express to you a mother's care God's mercy maiden does it curd thy blood To say I am thy mother What's the matter That this distempered messenger of wet The manycolour'd Iris rounds thine eye Why that you are my daughterThat I am notI say I am your motherPardon

your pulse What pale again My fear hath catch'd your fondness Now I see The myst'ry of your loneliness and find Your salt tears' head Now to all sense 'tis gross You love my son invention is asham'd Against the proclamation of thy passion To say thou dost not Therefore tell me true But tell me then 'tis so for look thy cheeks Confess it th' one to th' other and thine eyes See it so grossly shown in thy behaviours That in their kind they speak it only sin And hellish obstinacy tie thy tongue That truth should be suspected Speak is't so If it be so you have wound a goodly clew If it be not

any token of presumptuous suit Nor would I have him till I do deserve him Yet never know how that desert should be I know I love in vain strive against hope Yet in this captious and intenible sieve I still pour in the waters of my love And lack not to lose still Thus Indianlike Religious in mine error I adore The sun that looks upon his worshipper But knows of him no more My dearest madam Let not your hate encounter with my love For loving where you do but if yourself Whose aged honour cites a virtuous youth Did ever in so true a flame of liking Wish chastely and love dearly that your Dian Was

sweetly where she diesHad you not lately an intentspeak truly To go to ParisMadam I hadWherefore Tell trueI will tell truth by grace itself I swear You know my father left me some prescriptions Of rare and prov'd effects such as his reading And manifest experience had collected For general sovereignty and that he will'd me In heedfull'st reservation to bestow them As notes whose faculties inclusive were More than they were in note Amongst the rest There is a remedy approv'd set down To cure the desperate languishings whereof The King is render'd lostThis was your motive For Paris was it SpeakMy lord your son made me to think of this Else Paris and the medicine and the King Had from the conversation of my thoughts Haply been absent thenBut think you Helen If you should tender your supposed aid He would receive it He and his physicians Are of a mind he that they cannot help him They that they cannot help How shall they credit A poor unlearned virgin when the schools Embowell'd of their doctrine have let off The danger to itselfThere's something in't More than my father's skill which was the great'st Of his profession that his good receipt Shall for my legacy be sanctified By th' luckiest stars in heaven and would your honour But give me leave to try success I'd venture The welllost life of mine on his Grace's cure By such a day and hourDost thou believe'tAy madam knowinglyWhy Helen thou shalt have my leave and love Means and attendants and my loving greetings To those of mine in court I'll stay at home And pray God's blessing into thy attempt Be gone tomorrow and be sure of this What I can help thee to thou shalt not miss
