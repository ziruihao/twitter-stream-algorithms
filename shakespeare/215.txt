Sicilia On the road to the Capitaland The climate's delicate the air most sweet Fertile the isle the temple much surpassing The common praise it bearsI shall report For most it caught me the celestial habits Methinks I so should term them and the reverence Of the grave wearers O the sacrifice How ceremonious solemn and unearthly It was i' th' off'ringBut of all the burst And the eardeaf'ning voice o' th' oracle Kin to Jove's thunder so surpris'd my sense That I was nothingIf th' event o' th' journey Prove as successful to the Queen O be't so As it hath been to us rare pleasant speedy The time is worth the use on'tGreat Apollo Turn all to th' best These proclamations So forcing faults upon Hermione I little likeThe violent carriage of it Will clear or end the business When the oracle Thus by Apollo's great divine seal'd up Shall the contents discover something rare Even then will rush to knowledge Go fresh horses And gracious be the issueSicilia A court of justiceand This sessions to our great grief we pronounce Even pushes 'gainst our heart the party tried The daughter of a king our wife and one Of us too much belov'd Let us be clear'd Of being tyrannous since we so openly Proceed in justice which shall have due course Even to the guilt or the purgation Produce the prisonerIt is his Highness' pleasure that the Queen Appear in person here in courtas to her trialandSilenceRead the indictment Reads'Hermione Queen to the worthy Leontes King of Sicilia thou art here accused and arraigned of high treason in committing adultery with Polixenes King of Bohemia and conspiring with Camillo to take away the life of our sovereign lord the King thy royal husband the pretence whereof being by circumstances partly laid open thou Hermione contrary to the faith and allegiance of true subject didst counsel and aid them for their better safety to fly away by night'Since what I am to say must be but that Which contradicts my accusation and The testimony on my part no other But what comes from myself it shall scarce boot me To say 'Not guilty' Mine integrity Being counted falsehood shall as I express it Be so receiv'd But thus if pow'rs divine Behold our human actions as they do I doubt not then but innocence shall make False accusation blush and tyranny Tremble at patience You my lord best know Who least will seem to do so my past life Hath been as continent as chaste as true As I am now unhappy which is more Than history can pattern though devis'd And play'd to take spectators for behold me A fellow of the royal bed which owe A moiety of the throne a great king's daughter The mother to a hopeful prince here standing To prate and talk for life and honour fore Who please to come and hear For life I prize it As I weigh grief which I would spare for honour 'Tis a derivative from me to mine And only that I stand for I appeal To your own conscience sir before Polixenes Came to your court how I was in your grace How merited to be so since he came With what encounter so uncurrent I Have strain'd t' appear thus if one jot beyond The bound of honour or in act or will That way inclining hard'ned be the hearts Of all that hear me and my near'st of kin Cry fie upon my graveI ne'er heard yet That any of these bolder vices wanted Less impudence to gainsay what they did Than to perform it firstThat's true enough Though 'tis a saying sir not due to meYou will not own itMore than mistress of Which comes to me in name of fault I must not At all acknowledge For Polixenes With whom I am accus'd I do confess I lov'd him as in honour he requir'd With such a kind of love as might become A lady like me with a love even such So and no other as yourself commanded Which not to have done I think had been in me Both disobedience and ingratitude To you and toward your friend whose love had spoke Ever since it could speak from an infant freely That it was yours Now for conspiracy I know not how it tastes though it be dish'd For me to try how all I know of it Is that Camillo was an honest man And why he left your court the gods themselves Wotting no more than I are ignorantYou knew of his departure as you know What you have underta'en to do in's absenceSir You speak a language that I understand not My life stands in the level of your dreams Which I'll lay downYour actions are my dreams You had a bastard by Polixenes And I but dream'd it As you were past all shame Those of your fact are so so past all truth Which to deny concerns more than avails for as Thy brat hath been cast out like to itself No father owning it which is indeed More criminal in thee than it so thou Shalt feel our justice in whose easiest passage Look for no less than deathSir spare your threats The bug which you would fright me with I seek To me can life be no commodity The crown and comfort of my life your favour I do give lost for I do feel it gone But know not how it went my second joy And first fruits of my body from his presence I am barr'd like one infectious my third comfort Starr'd most unluckily is from my breast The innocent milk in it most innocent mouth Hal'd out to murder myself on every post Proclaim'd a strumpet with immodest hatred The childbed privilege denied which 'longs To women of all fashion lastly hurried Here to this place i' th' open air before I have got strength of limit Now my liege Tell me what blessings I have here alive That I should fear to die Therefore proceed But yet hear this mistake me not no life I prize it not a straw but for mine honour Which I would free if I shall be condemn'd Upon surmises all proofs sleeping else But what your jealousies awake I tell you 'Tis rigour and not law Your honours all I do refer me to the oracle Apollo be my judgeThis your request Is altogether just Therefore bring forth And in Apollo's name his oracle certain The Emperor of Russia was my father O that he were alive and here beholding His daughter's trial that he did but see The flatness of my misery yet with eyes Of pity not revengeRewith and You here shall swear upon this sword of justice That you Cleomenes and Dion have Been both at Delphos and from thence have brought This seal'dup oracle by the hand deliver'd Of great Apollo's priest and that since then You have not dar'd to break the holy seal Nor read the secrets in't All this we swearBreak up the seals and read Reads'Hermione is chaste Polixenes blameless Camillo a true subject Leontes a jealous tyrant his innocent babe truly begotten and the King shall live without an heir if that which is lost be not found'Now blessed be the great ApolloPraisedHast thou read truthAy my lord even so As it is here set downThere is no truth at all i' th' oracle The sessions shall proceed This is mere falsehooda My lord the King the KingWhat is the businessO sir I shall be hated to report it The Prince your son with mere conceit and fear Of the Queen's speed is goneHow GoneIs deadApollo's angry and the heavens themselves Do strike at my injustice swoons How now thereThis news is mortal to the Queen Look down And see what death is doingTake her hence Her heart is but o'ercharg'd she will recover I have too much believ'd mine own suspicion Beseech you tenderly apply to her Some remedies for life withApollo pardon My great profaneness 'gainst thine oracle I'll reconcile me to Polixenes New woo my queen recall the good Camillo Whom I proclaim a man of truth of mercy For being transported by my jealousies To bloody thoughts and to revenge I chose Camillo for the minister to poison My friend Polixenes which had been done But that the good mind of Camillo tardied My swift command though I with death and with Reward did threaten and encourage him Not doing it and being done He most humane And fill'd with honour to my kingly guest Unclasp'd my practice quit his fortunes here Which you knew great and to the certain hazard Of all incertainties himself commended No richer than his honour How he glisters Thorough my rust And how his piety Does my deeds make the blacker Re Woe the while O cut my lace lest my heart cracking it Break tooWhat fit is this good ladyWhat studied torments tyrant hast for me What wheels racks fires what flaying boiling In leads or oils What old or newer torture Must I receive whose every word deserves To taste of thy most worst Thy tyranny Together working with thy jealousies Fancies too weak for boys too green and idle For girls of nine O think what they have done And then run mad indeed stark mad for all Thy bygone fooleries were but spices of it That thou betray'dst Polixenes 'twas nothing That did but show thee of a fool inconstant And damnable ingrateful Nor was't much Thou wouldst have poison'd good Camillo's honour To have him kill a king poor trespasses More monstrous standing by whereof I reckon The casting forth to crows thy baby daughter To be or none or little though a devil Would have shed water out of fire ere done't Nor is't directly laid to thee the death Of the young Prince whose honourable thoughts Thoughts high for one so tender cleft the heart That could conceive a gross and foolish sire Blemish'd his gracious dam This is not no Laid to thy answer but the last O lords When I have said cry 'Woe' the Queen the Queen The sweet'st dear'st creature's dead and vengeance For't not dropp'd down yetThe higher pow'rs forbidI say she's dead I'll swear't If word nor oath Prevail not go and see If you can bring Tincture or lustre in her lip her eye Heat outwardly or breath within I'll serve you As I would do the gods But O thou tyrant Do not repent these things for they are heavier Than all thy woes can stir therefore betake thee To nothing but despair A thousand knees Ten thousand years together naked fasting Upon a barren mountain and still winter In storm perpetual could not move the gods To look that way thou wertGo on go on Thou canst not speak too much I have deserv'd All tongues to talk their bitt'restSay no more Howe'er the business goes you have made fault I' th' boldness of your speechI am sorry for't All faults I make when I shall come to know them I do repent Alas I have show'd too much The rashness of a woman He is touch'd To th' noble heart What's gone and what's past help Should be past grief Do not receive affliction At my petition I beseech you rather Let me be punish'd that have minded you Of what you should forget Now good my liege Sir royal sir forgive a foolish woman The love I bore your queen lo fool again I'll speak of her no more nor of your children I'll not remember you of my own lord Who is lost too Take your patience to you And I'll say nothingThou didst speak but well When most the truth which I receive much better Than to be pitied of thee Prithee bring me To the dead bodies of my queen and son One grave shall be for both Upon them shall The causes of their death appear unto Our shame perpetual Once a day I'll visit The chapel where they lie and tears shed there Shall be my recreation So long as nature Will bear up with this exercise so long I daily vow to use it Come and lead me To these sorrows Bohemia The seacoastwith theand a Thou art perfect then our ship hath touch'd upon The deserts of BohemiaAy my lord and fear We have landed in ill time the skies look grimly And threaten present blusters In my conscience The heavens with that we have in hand are angry And frown upon 'sTheir sacred wills be done Go get aboard Look to thy bark I'll not be long before I call upon theeMake your best haste and go not Too far i' th' land 'tis

heard but not believ'd the spirits o' th' dead May walk again If such thing be thy mother Appear'd to me last night for ne'er was dream So like a waking To me comes a creature Sometimes her head on one side some another I never saw a vessel of like sorrow So fill'd and so becoming in pure white robes Like very sanctity she did approach My cabin where I lay thrice bow'd before me And gasping to begin some speech her eyes Became two spouts the fury spent anon Did this break from her 'Good Antigonus Since fate against thy better disposition Hath made thy person for the throwerout Of my poor babe according to thine oath Places remote enough are in Bohemia There weep and leave it crying and for the babe Is counted lost for ever Perdita I prithee call't For this ungentle business Put on thee by my lord thou ne'er shalt see Thy wife Paulina more' so with shrieks She melted into air Affrighted much I did in time collect myself and thought This was so and no slumber Dreams are toys Yet for this once yea superstitiously I will be squar'd by this I do believe Hermione hath suffer'd death and that Apollo would this being indeed the issue Of King Polixenes it should here be laid Either for life or death upon the earth Of its right father Blossom speed thee wellLaying down the child There lie and there thy character there these Laying down a bundle Which may if fortune please both

that's not to the point O the most piteous cry of the poor souls Sometimes to see 'em and not to see 'em now the ship boring the moon with her mainmast and anon swallowed with yeast and froth as you'd thrust a cork into a hogshead And then for the land service to see how the bear tore out his shoulderbone how he cried to me for help and said his name was Antigonus a nobleman But to make an end of the ship to see how the sea flapdragon'd it but first how the poor souls roared and the sea mock'd them and how the poor gentleman roared and the bear mock'd him both roaring louder than the sea or
