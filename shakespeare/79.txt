London The palace and Now tell me brother Clarence what think you Of this new marriage with the Lady Grey Hath not our brother made a worthy choiceAlas you know 'tis far from hence to France How could he stay till Warwick made returnMy lords forbear this talk here comes the KingFlourish attended as Queenand others Four stand on one side and four on the otherAnd his wellchosen brideI mind to tell him plainly what I thinkNow brother of Clarence how like you our choice That you stand pensive as half malcontentAs well as Lewis of France or the Earl of Warwick Which are so weak of courage and in judgment That they'll take no offence at our abuseSuppose they take offence without a cause They are but Lewis and Warwick I am Edward Your King and Warwick's and must have my willAnd shall have your will because our King Yet hasty marriage seldom proveth wellYea brother Richard are you offended tooNotNo God forbid that I should wish them sever'd Whom God hath join'd together ay and 'twere pity To sunder them that yoke so well togetherSetting your scorns and your mislike aside Tell me some reason why the Lady Grey Should not become my wife and England's Queen And you too Somerset and Montague Speak freely what you thinkThen this is mine opinion that King Lewis Becomes your enemy for mocking him About the marriage of the Lady BonaAnd Warwick doing what you gave in charge Is now dishonoured by this new marriageWhat if both Lewis and Warwick be appeas'd By such invention as I can deviseYet to have join'd with France in such alliance Would more have strength'ned this our commonwealth 'Gainst foreign storms than any homebred marriageWhy knows not Montague that of itself England is safe if true within itselfBut the safer when 'tis back'd with France'Tis better using France than trusting France Let us be back'd with God and with the seas Which He hath giv'n for fence impregnable And with their helps only defend ourselves In them and in ourselves our safety liesFor this one speech Lord Hastings well deserves To have the heir of the Lord HungerfordAy what of that it was my will and grant And for this once my will shall stand for lawAnd yet methinks your Grace hath not done well To give the heir and daughter of Lord Scales Unto the brother of your loving bride She better would have fitted me or Clarence But in your bride you bury brotherhoodOr else you would not have bestow'd the heir Of the Lord Bonville on your new wife's son And leave your brothers to go speed elsewhereAlas poor Clarence Is it for a wife That thou art malcontent I will provide theeIn choosing for yourself you show'd your judgment Which being shallow you shall give me leave To play the broker in mine own behalf And to that end I shortly mind to leave youLeave me or tarry Edward will be King And not be tied unto his brother's willMy lords before it pleas'd his Majesty To raise my state to title of a queen Do me but right and you must all confess That I was not ignoble of descent And meaner than myself have had like fortune But as this title honours me and mine So your dislikes to whom I would be pleasing Doth cloud my joys with danger and with sorrowMy love forbear to fawn upon their frowns What danger or what sorrow can befall thee So long as Edward is thy constant friend And their true sovereign whom they must obey Nay whom they shall obey and love thee too Unless they seek for hatred at my hands Which if they do yet will I keep thee safe And they shall feel the vengeance of my wrathAside I hear yet say not much but think the morea Now messenger what letters or what news From FranceMy sovereign liege no letters and few words But such as I without your special pardon Dare not relateGo to we pardon thee therefore in brief Tell me their words as near as thou canst guess them What answer makes King Lewis unto our lettersAt my depart these were his very words 'Go tell false Edward the supposed king That Lewis of France is sending over masquers To revel it with him and his new bride' Lewis so brave Belike he thinks me Henry But what said Lady Bona to my marriageThese were her words utt'red with mild disdain 'Tell him in hope he'll prove a widower shortly I'll wear the willowgarland for his sake'I blame not her she could say little less She had the wrong But what said Henry's queen For I have heard that she was there in place'Tell him' quoth she 'my mourning weeds are done And I am ready to put armour on'Belike she minds to play the Amazon But what said Warwick to these injuriesHe more incens'd against your Majesty Than all the rest discharg'd me with these words 'Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong And therefore I'll uncrown him ere't be long'Ha durst the traitor breathe out so proud words Well I will arm me being thus forewarn'd They shall have wars and pay for their presumption But say is Warwick friends with MargaretAy gracious sovereign they are so link'd in friendship That young Prince Edward marries Warwick's daughterBelike the elder Clarence will have the younger Now brother king farewell and sit you fast For I will hence to Warwick's other daughter That though I want a kingdom yet in marriage I may not prove inferior to yourself You that love me and Warwick follow meand followsAside NotMy thoughts aim at a further matter I Stay not for the love of Edward but the crownClarence and Somerset both gone to Warwick Yet am I arm'd against the worst can happen And haste is needful in this desp'rate case Pembroke and Stafford you in our behalf Go levy men and make prepare for war They are already or quickly will be landed Myself in person will straight follow you But ere I go Hastings and Montague Resolve my doubt You twain of all the rest Are near to Warwick by blood and by alliance Tell me if you love Warwick more than me If it be so then both depart to him I rather wish you foes than hollow friends But if you mind to hold your true obedience Give me assurance with some friendly vow That I may never have you in suspectSo God help Montague as he proves trueAnd Hastings as he favours Edward's causeNow brother Richard will you stand by usAy in despite of all that shall withstand youWhy so then am I sure of victory Now therefore let us hence and lose no hour Till we meet Warwick with his foreign pow'rA plain in Warwickshireandwith French soldiersTrust me my lord all hitherto goes well The common people by numbers swarm to us andBut see where Somerset and Clarence comes Speak suddenly my lords are we all friendsFear not that my lordThen gentle Clarence welcome unto Warwick And welcome Somerset I hold it cowardice To rest mistrustful where a noble heart Hath pawn'd an open hand in sign of love Else might I think that Clarence Edward's brother Were but a feigned friend to our proceedings But welcome sweet Clarence my daughter shall be thine And now what rests but in night's coverture Thy brother being carelessly encamp'd His soldiers lurking in the towns about And but attended by a simple guard We may surprise and take him at our pleasure Our scouts have found the adventure very easy That as Ulysses and stout Diomede With sleight and manhood stole to Rhesus' tents And brought from thence the Thracian fatal steeds So we well cover'd with the night's black mantle At unawares may beat down Edward's guard And seize himself I say not 'slaughter him' For I intend but only to surprise him You that will follow me to this attempt Applaud the name of Henry with your leaderThey all cry 'Henry' Why then let's on our way in silent sort For Warwick and his friends God and Saint GeorgeEdward's camp near Warwickthreeto guard thetentCome on my masters each man take his stand The King by this is set him down to sleepWhat will he not to bedWhy no for he hath made a solemn vow Never to lie and take his natural rest Till Warwick or himself be quite suppress'dTomorrow then belike shall be the day If Warwick be so near as men reportBut say I pray what nobleman is that That with the King here resteth in his tent'Tis the Lord Hastings the King's chiefest friendO is it So But why commands the King That his chief followers lodge in towns about him While he himself keeps in the cold field'Tis the more honour because more dangerousAy but give me worship and quietness I like it better than dangerous honour If Warwick knew in what estate he stands 'Tis to be doubted he would waken himUnless our halberds did shut up his passageAy wherefore else guard we his royal tent But to defend his person from nightfoesand French soldiers silent allThis is his tent and see where stand his guard Courage my masters Honour now or never But follow me and Edward shall be oursWho goes thereStay or thou diestand the rest cry all 'Warwick Warwick' and set upon the guard who fly crying 'Arm Arm' and the rest following them The drum playing and trumpet sounding re and the rest bringing the out in his gownsitting in a chair and fly over the stageWhat are they that fly thereRichard and Hastings Let them go here is the DukeThe Duke Why Warwick when we parted Thou call'dst me KingAy but the case is alter'd When you disgrac'd me in my embassade Then I degraded you from being King And come now to create you Duke of York Alas how should you govern any kingdom That know not how to use ambassadors Nor how to be contented with one wife Nor how to use your brothers brotherly Nor how to study for the people's welfare Nor how to shroud yourself from enemiesYea brother of Clarence art thou here too Nay then I see that Edward needs must down Yet Warwick in despite of all mischance Of thee thyself and all thy complices Edward will always bear himself as King Though fortune's malice overthrow my state My mind exceeds the compass of her wheelThen for his mind be Edward England's kingTakes off his crown But Henry now shall wear the English crown And be true King indeed thou but the shadow My Lord of Somerset at my request See that forthwith Duke Edward be convey'd Unto my brother Archbishop of York When I have fought with Pembroke and his fellows I'll follow you and tell what answer Lewis and the Lady Bona send to him Now for a while farewell good Duke of YorkWhat fates impose that men must needs abide It boots not to resist both wind and tide They lead him out forciblyWhat now remains my lords for us to do But march to London with our soldiersAy that's the first thing that we have to do To free King Henry from imprisonment And see him seated in the regal throne London The palaceand Madam what makes you in this sudden changeWhy brother Rivers are you yet to learn What late misfortune is befall'n King EdwardWhat loss of some pitch'd battle against WarwickNo but the loss of his own royal personThen is my sovereign slainAy almost slain for he is taken prisoner Either betray'd by falsehood of his guard Or by his foe surpris'd at unawares And as I further have to understand Is new committed to the Bishop of York Fell Warwick's brother and by that our foeThese news I must confess are full of grief Yet gracious madam bear it as you may Warwick may lose that now hath won the dayTill then fair hope must hinder life's decay And I the rather wean me from despair For love of Edward's offspring in my womb This is it that makes me bridle passion And bear with mildness my misfortune's cross Ay ay for this I draw in many a tear And stop the rising of bloodsucking sighs Lest with my sighs or tears I blast or drown King Edward's fruit true heir to th' English crownBut madam where is Warwick then becomeI am inform'd that he comes towards London To set the crown once more on Henry's head Guess thou the rest King Edward's friends must down But to prevent the tyrant's violence For trust not him that hath once broken faith I'll hence forthwith unto the sanctuary To save at least the heir of Edward's right There shall I rest secure from force and fraud Come therefore let us fly while we may fly If Warwick take us we are sure to die A park near Middleham Castle in Yorkshire and othersNow my Lord Hastings and Sir William Stanley Leave off to wonder why I drew you hither Into this chiefest thicket of the park Thus stands the case you know our King my brother Is prisoner to the Bishop here at whose hands He hath good usage and great liberty And often but attended with weak guard Comes hunting this way to disport himself I have advertis'd him by secret means That if about this hour he make this way Under the colour of his usual game He shall here find his friends with horse and men To set him free from his captivity and a with himThis way my lord for this way lies the gameNay this way man See where the huntsmen stand Now brother of Gloucester Lord Hastings and the rest Stand you thus close to steal the Bishop's deerBrother the time and case requireth haste Your horse stands ready at the park cornerBut whither shall we thenTo Lynn my lord and shipt from thence to FlandersWell guess'd believe me for that was my meaningStanley I will requite thy forwardnessBut wherefore stay we 'Tis no time to talkHuntsman what say'st thou Wilt thou go alongBetter do so than tarry and be hang'dCome then away let's ha' no more adoBishop farewell Shield thee from Warwick's frown And pray that I may repossess the crownLondon The Tower Flourishyoungand attendantsMaster Lieutenant now that God and friends Have shaken Edward from the regal seat And turn'd my captive state to liberty My fear to hope my sorrows unto joys At our enlargement what are thy due feesSubjects may challenge nothing of their sov'reigns But if an humble prayer may prevail I then crave pardon of your MajestyFor what Lieutenant For well using me Nay be thou sure I'll well requite thy kindness For that it made my imprisonment a pleasure Ay such a pleasure as incaged birds Conceive when after many moody thoughts At last by notes of household harmony They quite forget their loss of liberty But Warwick after God thou set'st me free And chiefly therefore I thank God and thee He was the author thou the instrument Therefore that I may conquer fortune's spite By living low where fortune cannot hurt me And that the people of this blessed land May not be punish'd with my thwarting stars Warwick although my head still wear the crown I here resign my government to thee For thou art fortunate in all thy deedsYour Grace hath still been fam'd for virtuous And now may seem as wise as virtuous By spying and avoiding fortune's malice For few men rightly temper with the stars Yet in this one thing let me blame your Grace For choosing me when Clarence is in placeNo Warwick thou art worthy of the sway To whom the heav'ns in thy nativity Adjudg'd an olive branch and laurel crown As likely to be blest in peace and war And therefore I yield thee my free consentAnd I choose Clarence only for ProtectorWarwick and Clarence give me both your hands Now join your hands and with your hands your hearts That no dissension hinder government I make you both Protectors of this land While I myself will lead a private life And in devotion spend my latter days To sin's rebuke and my Creator's praiseWhat answers Clarence to his sovereign's willThat he consents if Warwick yield consent For on thy fortune I repose myselfWhy then though loath yet must I be content We'll yoke together like a double shadow To Henry's body and supply his place I mean in bearing weight of government While he enjoys the honour and his ease And Clarence now then it is more than needful Forthwith that Edward be pronounc'd a traitor And all his lands and goods confiscatedWhat else And that succession be determin'dAy therein Clarence shall not want his partBut with the first of all your chief affairs Let me entreat for I command no more That Margaret your Queen and my son Edward Be sent for to return from France with speed For till I see them here by doubtful fear My joy of liberty is half eclips'dIt shall be done my sovereign with all speedMy Lord of Somerset what youth is that Of whom you seem to have so tender careMy liege it is young Henry Earl of RichmondCome hither England's hopeLays his hand on his head If secret powers Suggest but truth to my divining thoughts This pretty lad will prove our country's bliss His looks are full of peaceful majesty His head by nature fram'd to wear a crown His hand to wield a sceptre and himself Likely in time to bless a regal throne Make much of him my lords for this is he Must help you more than you are hurt by mea What news my friendThat Edward is escaped from your brother And fled as he hears since to BurgundyUnsavoury news But how made he escapeHe was convey'd by Richard Duke of Gloucester And the Lord Hastings who attended him In secret ambush on the forest side And from the Bishop's huntsmen rescu'd him For hunting was his daily exerciseMy brother was too careless of his charge But let us hence my sovereign to provide A salve for any sore that may betide all but and My lord I like not of this flight of Edward's For doubtless Burgundy will yield him help And we shall have more wars befor't be long As Henry's late presaging prophecy Did glad my heart with hope of this young Richmond So doth my heart misgive me in these conflicts What may befall him to his harm and ours Therefore Lord Oxford to prevent the worst Forthwith we'll send him hence to Brittany Till storms be past of civil enmityAy for if Edward repossess the crown 'Tis like that Richmond with the rest shall downIt shall be so he shall to Brittany Come therefore let's about it speedilyBefore York Flourish and soldiersNow brother Richard Lord Hastings and the rest Yet thus far fortune maketh us amends And says that once more I shall interchange My waned state for Henry's regal crown Well have

that he will seduce the restThat's not my fear my meed hath got me fame I have not stopp'd mine ears to their demands Nor posted off their suits with slow delays My pity hath been balm to heal their wounds My mildness hath allay'd their swelling griefs My mercy dried their waterflowing tears I have not been desirous of their wealth Nor much oppress'd them with great subsidies Nor forward of revenge though they much err'd Then why should they love Edward more than me No Exeter these graces challenge grace And when the lion fawns upon the lamb The lamb will never cease to follow him Shout
