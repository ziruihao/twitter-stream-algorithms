severallyPeter didst ever see the likeHe kills her in her own humour Re Where is heIn her chamber Making a sermon of continency to her And rails and swears and rates that she poor soul Knows not which way to stand to look to speak And sits as one new risen from a dream Away away for he is coming hitherRe Thus have I politicly begun my reign And 'tis my hope to end successfully My falcon now is sharp and passing empty And till she stoop she must not be fullgorg'd For then she never looks upon her lure Another way I have to man my haggard To make her come and know her keeper's call That is to watch her as we watch these kites That bate and beat and will not be obedient She eat no meat today nor none shall eat Last night she slept not nor tonight she shall not As with the meat some undeserved fault I'll find about the making of the bed And here I'll fling the pillow there the bolster This way the coverlet another way the sheets Ay and amid this hurly I intend That all is done in reverend care of her And in conclusion she shall watch all night And if she chance to nod I'll rail and brawl And with the clamour keep her still awake This is a way to kill a wife with kindness And thus I'll curb her mad and headstrong humour He that knows better how to tame a shrew Now let him speak 'tis charity to showPadua Beforehouseasand as Is 't possible friend Licio that Mistress Bianca
