morrow good lieutenant I am sorry For your displeasure but all will sure be well The general and his wife are talking of it And she speaks for you stoutly The Moor replies That he you hurt is of great fame in Cyprus And great affinity and that in wholesome wisdom He might not but refuse you but he protests he loves you And needs no other suitor but his likings To take the safest occasion by the front To bring you in again Yet I beseech you If you think fit or that it may be done Give me advantage of some brief discourse With Desdemona alonePray you come in I will bestow you where you shall

and you again As friendly as you were Bounteous madam Whatever shall become of Michael Cassio He's never anything but your true servantI know't I thank you You do love my lord You have known him long and be you well assured He shall in strangeness stand no farther off Than in a politic distanceAy but lady That policy may either last so long Or feed upon such nice and waterish diet Or breed itself so out of circumstances That I being absent and my place supplied My general will forget my love and serviceDo not doubt that Before Emilia here I give thee warrant of thy place assure thee If I do vow a friendship I'll perform it To the last article My lord shall never rest I'll watch him tame and talk him out of patience His bed shall seem a school his board a shrift I'll intermingle everything he does With Cassio's suit Therefore be merry Cassio For thy solicitor shall rather die Than give thy cause awayOthello and Iago at a distanceMadam here comes my lordMadam I'll take my leaveNay stay and hear me speakMadam not now I am very ill at ease Unfit for mine own purposesWell do your discretionCassioHa I like not thatWhat dost thou sayNothing my lord or if I know not whatWas not that Cassio parted from my wifeCassio my lord No sure I cannot think it That he would steal away so guiltylike Seeing you comingI do believe 'twas heHow now my lord I have been talking with a suitor here A man that languishes in your displeasureWho is't you meanWhy your lieutenant Cassio Good my lord If I have any grace or power to move you His present reconciliation take For if he be not one that truly loves you That errs in ignorance and not in cunning I have no judgement in an honest face I prithee call him back Went he hence nowAy sooth so humbled That he hath left part of his grief with me To suffer with him Good love call him backNot now sweet Desdemona some other timeBut shall't be shortlyThe sooner sweet for youShall't be tonight at supperNo not tonightTomorrow dinner thenI shall not dine at home I meet the captains at the citadelWhy then tomorrow night or Tuesday morn On Tuesday noon or night on Wednesday morn I prithee name the time but let it not Exceed three days In faith he's penitent And yet his trespass in our common reason Save that they say the wars must make example Out of their best is not almost a fault To incur a private check When shall he come Tell me Othello I wonder in my soul What you would ask me that I should deny Or stand so mammering on What Michael Cassio That came awooing with you and so many a time When I have spoke of you dispraisingly Hath ta'en your part to have so much to do To bring him in Trust me I could do muchPrithee no more Let him come when he will I will deny thee nothing Why this is not a boon 'Tis as I should entreat you wear your gloves Or feed on nourishing dishes or keep you warm Or sue to you to do a peculiar profit To your own person Nay when I have a suit Wherein I mean to touch your love indeed It shall be full of poise and difficult weight And fearful to be grantedI will deny thee nothing Whereon I do beseech thee grant me this To leave me but a little to myselfShall I deny you No Farewell my lordFarewell my Desdemona I'll come to thee straightEmilia come Be as your fancies teach you Whate'er you be I am obedient Desdemona and EmiliaExcellent wretch Perdition catch my soul But I do love thee and when I love thee not Chaos is come againMy noble lordWhat dost thou say IagoDid Michael Cassio when you woo'd my lady Know of your loveHe did from first to last Why dost thou askBut for a satisfaction of my thought No further harmWhy of thy thought IagoI did not think he had been acquainted with herO yes and went between us very oftIndeedIndeed ay indeed Discern'st thou aught in that Is he not honestHonest my lordHonest Ay honestMy lord for aught I knowWhat dost thou thinkThink my lordThink my lord By heaven he echoes me As if there were some monster in his thought Too hideous to be shown Thou dost mean something I heard thee say even now thou like'st not that When Cassio left my wife What didst not like And when I told thee he was of my counsel In my whole course of wooing thou criedst Indeed And didst contract and purse thy brow together As if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain Some horrible conceit If thou dost love me Show me thy thoughtMy lord you know I love you I think thou dost And for I know thou'rt full of love and honesty And weigh'st thy words before thou givest them breath Therefore these stops of thine fright me the more For such things in a false disloyal knave Are tricks of custom but in a man that's just They're close dilations working from the heart That passion cannot ruleFor Michael Cassio I dare be sworn I think that he is honestI think so too Men should be what they seem Or those that be not would they might seem noneCertain men should be what they seemWhy then I think Cassio's an honest manNay yet there's more in this I prithee speak to me as to thy thinkings As thou dost ruminate and give thy worst of thoughts The worst of wordsGood my lord pardon me Though I am bound to every act of duty I am not bound to that all slaves are free to Utter my thoughts Why say they are vile and false As where's that palace whereinto foul things Sometimes intrude not Who has a breast so pure But some uncleanly apprehensions Keep leets and lawdays and in session sit With meditations lawfulThou dost conspire against thy friend Iago If thou but think'st him wrong'd and makest his ear A stranger to thy thoughtsI do beseech you Though I perchance am vicious in my guess As I confess it is my nature's plague To spy into abuses and oft my jealousy Shapes faults that are not that your wisdom yet From one that so imperfectly conceits Would take no notice nor build yourself a trouble Out of his scattering and unsure observance It were not for your quiet nor your good Nor for my manhood honesty or wisdom To let you know my thoughtsWhat dost thou meanGood name in man and woman dear my lord Is the immediate jewel of their souls Who steals my purse steals trash 'tis something nothing 'Twas mine 'tis his and has been slave to thousands But he that filches from me my good name Robs me of that which not enriches him And makes me poor indeedBy heaven I'll know thy thoughtsYou cannot if my heart were in your hand Nor shall not whilst 'tis in my custodyHa O beware my lord of jealousy It is the greeneyed monster which doth mock The meat it feeds on That cuckold lives in bliss Who certain of his fate loves not his wronger But O what damned minutes tells he o'er Who dotes yet doubts suspects yet strongly lovesO miseryPoor and content is rich and rich enough But riches fineless is as poor as winter To him that ever fears he shall be poor Good heaven the souls of all my tribe defend From jealousyWhy why is this Think'st thou I'ld make a life of jealousy To follow still the changes of the moon With fresh suspicions No To be once in doubt Is once to be resolved Exchange me for a goat When I shall turn the business of my soul To such exsufflicate and blown surmises Matching thy inference 'Tis not to make me jealous To say my wife is fair feeds well loves company Is free of speech sings plays and dances well Where virtue is these are more virtuous Nor from mine own weak merits will I draw The smallest fear or doubt of her revolt For she had eyes and chose me No Iago I'll see before I doubt when I doubt prove And on the proof there is no more but this Away at once with love or jealousyI am glad of it for now I shall have reason To show the love and duty that I bear you With franker spirit Therefore as I am bound Receive it from me I speak not yet of proof Look to your wife observe her well with Cassio Wear your eye thus not jealous nor secure I would not have your free and noble nature Out of selfbounty be abused Look to't I know our country disposition well In Venice they do let heaven see the pranks They dare not show their husbands their best conscience Is not to leave't undone but keep't unknownDost thou say soShe did deceive her father marrying you And when she seem'd to shake and fear your looks She loved them mostAnd so she did Why go to then She that so young could give out such a seeming To seel her father's eyes up close as oak He thought 'twas witchcraft but I am much to blame I humbly do beseech you of your pardon For too much loving youI am bound to thee foreverI see this hath a little dash'd your spiritsNot a jot not a jot I'faith I fear it has I hope you will consider what is spoke Comes from my love But I do see you're moved I am to pray you not to strain my speech To grosser issues nor to larger reach Than to suspicionI will not Should you do so my lord My speech should fall into such vile success Which my thoughts aim not at Cassio's my worthy friend My lord I see you're movedNo not much moved I do not think but Desdemona's honestLong live she so and long live you to think soAnd yet how nature erring from itselfAy there's the point as to be bold with you Not to affect many proposed matches Of her own clime complexion and degree Whereto we see in all things nature tends Foh one may smell in such a will most rank Foul disproportion thoughts unnatural But pardon me I do not in position Distinctly speak of her though I may fear Her will recoiling to her better judgement May fall to match you with her country forms And happily repent Farewell farewell If more thou dost perceive let me know more Set on thy wife to observe Leave me IagoGoing My lord I take my leaveWhy did I marry This honest creature doubtless Sees and knows more much more than he unfoldsReturning My lord I would I might entreat your honor To scan this thing no further leave it to time Though it be fit that Cassio have his place For sure he fills it up with great ability Yet if you please to hold him off awhile You shall by that perceive him and his means Note if your lady strain his tainment With any strong or vehement importunity Much will be seen in that In the meantime Let me be thought too busy in my fears As worthy cause I have to fear I am And hold her free I do beseech your honorFear not my governmentI once more take my leaveThis fellow's of exceeding honesty And knows all qualities with a learned spirit Of human dealings If I do prove her haggard Though that her jesses were my dear heartstrings I'ld whistle her off and let her down the wind To prey at fortune Haply for I am black And have not those soft parts of conversation That chamberers have or for I am declined Into the vale of years yet that's not much She's gone I am abused and my relief Must be to loathe her O curse of marriage That we can call these delicate creatures ours And not their appetites I had rather be a toad And live upon the vapor of a dungeon Than keep a corner in the thing I love For others' uses Yet 'tis the plague of great ones Prerogatived are they less than the base 'Tis destiny unshunnable like death Even then this forked plague is fated to us When we do quicken Desdemona comes Re Desdemona and Emilia If she be false O then heaven mocks itself I'll not believe't How now my dear Othello Your dinner and the generous islanders By you invited do attend your presenceI am to blame Why do you speak so faintly Are you not wellI have a pain upon my forehead hereFaith that's with watching 'twill away again Let me but bind it hard within this hour It will be wellYour napkin is too little He puts the handkerchief from him and she drops it Let it alone Come I'll go in with youI am very sorry that you are not wellOthello and DesdemonaI am glad I have found this napkin This was her first remembrance from the Moor My wayward husband hath a hundred times Woo'd me to steal it but she so loves the token For he conjured her she should ever keep it That she reserves it evermore about her To kiss and talk to I'll have the work ta'en out And give't Iago What he will do with it Heaven knows not I I nothing but to please his fantasy Re IagoHow now what do you here aloneDo not you chide I have a thing for youA thing for me It is a common thingHaTo have a foolish wifeO is that all What will you give me now For that same handkerchiefWhat handkerchiefWhat handkerchief Why that the Moor first gave to Desdemona That which so often you did bid me stealHast stol'n it from herNo faith she let it drop by negligence And to the advantage I being here took't up Look here it isA good wench give it meWhat will you do with't that you have been so earnest To have me filch itSnatching it Why what is that to youIf't be not for some purpose of import Give't me again Poor lady she'll run mad When she shall lack itBe not acknown on't I have use for it Go leave me Emilia I will in Cassio's lodging lose this napkin And let him find it Trifles light as air Are to the jealous confirmations strong As proofs of holy writ this may do something The Moor already changes with my poison Dangerous conceits are in their natures poisons Which at the first are scarce found to distaste But with a little act upon the blood Burn like the mines of sulphur I did say so Look where he comes Re Othello Not poppy nor mandragora Nor all the drowsy syrups of the world Shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep Which thou owedst yesterdayHa ha false to meWhy how now general No more of thatAvaunt be gone Thou hast set me on the rack I swear 'tis better to be much abused Than but to know't a little How now my lordWhat sense had I of her stol'n hours of lust I saw't not thought it not it harm'd not me I slept the next night well was free and merry I found not Cassio's kisses on her lips He that is robb'd not wanting what is stol'n Let him not know't and he's not robb'd at allI am sorry to hear thisI had been happy if the general camp Pioners and all had tasted her sweet body So I had nothing known O now forever Farewell the tranquil mind Farewell content Farewell the plumed troop and the big wars That make ambition virtue O farewell Farewell the neighing steed and the shrill trump The spiritstirring drum the earpiercing fife The royal banner and all quality Pride pomp and circumstance of glorious war And O you mortal engines whose rude throats The immortal Jove's dread clamors counterfeit Farewell Othello's occupation's goneIs't possible my lordVillain be sure thou prove my love a whore Be sure of it Give me the ocular proof Or by the worth of man's eternal soul Thou hadst been better have been born a dog Than answer my waked wrathIs't come to thisMake me to see't or at the least so prove it That the probation bear no hinge nor loop To hang a doubt on or woe upon thy lifeMy noble lordIf thou dost slander her and torture me Never pray more abandon all remorse On horror's head horrors accumulate Do deeds to make heaven weep all earth amazed For nothing canst thou to damnation add Greater than that O grace O heaven defend me Are you a man have you a soul or sense God be wi' you take mine office O wretched fool That livest to make thine honesty a vice O monstrous world Take note take note O world To be direct and honest is not safe I thank you for this profit and from hence I'll love no friend sith love breeds such offenseNay stay thou shouldst be honestI should be wise for honesty's a fool And loses that it works forBy the world I think my wife be honest and think she is not I think that thou art just and think thou art not I'll have some proof Her name that was as fresh As Dian's visage is now begrimed and black As mine own face If there be cords or knives Poison or fire or suffocating streams I'll not endure it Would I were satisfiedI see sir you are eaten up with passion I do repent me that I put it to you You would be satisfied Would Nay I willAnd may But how how satisfied my lord Would you the supervisor grossly gape on Behold her topp'dDeath and damnation OIt were a tedious difficulty I think To bring them to that prospect Damn them then If ever mortal eyes do see them bolster More than their own What then how then What shall I say Where's satisfaction It is impossible you should see this Were they as prime as goats as hot as monkeys As salt as wolves in pride and fools as gross As ignorance made drunk But yet I say If imputation and strong circumstances Which lead directly to the door of truth Will give you satisfaction you may have'tGive me a living reason she's disloyalI do not like the office But sith I am 'd in this cause so far Prick'd to't by foolish honesty and love I will go on I lay with Cassio lately And being troubled with a raging tooth I could not sleep There are a kind of men so loose of soul That in their sleeps will mutter their affairs One of this kind is Cassio In sleep I heard him say Sweet Desdemona Let us be wary let us hide our loves And then sir would he gripe and wring my hand Cry O sweet creature and then kiss me hard As if he pluck'd up kisses by the roots That grew upon my lips then laid his leg Over my thigh and sigh'd and kiss'd and then Cried Cursed fate that gave thee to the MoorO monstrous monstrous Nay this was but his dreamBut this denoted a foregone conclusion 'Tis a shrewd doubt though it be but a dreamAnd this may help to thicken other proofs That do demonstrate thinly I'll tear her all to piecesNay but be wise yet we see nothing done She may be honest yet Tell me but this Have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief Spotted with strawberries in your wife's handI gave her such a one 'twas my first giftI know not that but such a handkerchief I am sure it was your wife's did I today See Cassio wipe his beard with If it be thatIf it be that or any that was hers It speaks against her with the other proofsO that the slave had forty thousand lives One is too poor too weak for my revenge Now do I see 'tis true Look here Iago All my fond love thus do I blow to heaven 'Tis gone Arise black vengeance from thy hollow hell Yield up O love thy crown and hearted throne To tyrannous hate Swell bosom with thy fraught For 'tis of aspics' tongues Yet be contentO blood blood bloodPatience I say your mind perhaps may changeNever Iago Like to the Pontic Sea Whose icy current and compulsive course Ne'er feels retiring ebb but keeps due on To the Propontic and the Hellespont Even so my bloody thoughts with violent pace Shall ne'er look back ne'er ebb to humble love Till that a capable and wide revenge Swallow them up Now by yond marble heaven In the due reverence of a sacred vowKneels I here engage my wordsDo not rise yetKneels Witness you everburning lights above You elements that clip us round about Witness that here Iago doth give up The execution of his wit hands heart To wrong'd Othello's service Let him command And to obey shall be in me remorse What bloody business ever They riseI greet thy love Not with vain thanks but with acceptance bounteous And will upon the instant put thee to't Within these three days let me hear thee say That Cassio's not aliveMy friend is dead 'tis done at your request But let her live Damn her lewd minx O damn her Come go with me apart I will withdraw To furnish me with some swift means of death For the fair devil Now art thou my lieutenantI am your own foreverBefore the castleDesdemona Emilia and ClownDo you know sirrah where Lieutenant Cassio liesI dare not say he lies anywhereWhy manHe's a soldier and for one to say a soldier lies is stabbingGo to Where lodges heTo tell you where he lodges is to tell you where I lieCan anything be made of thisI know not where he lodges and for me to devise a lodging and say he lies here or he lies there were to lie in mine own throatCan you inquire him out and be edified by reportI will catechize the world for him that is make questions and by them answerSeek him bid him come hither Tell him I have moved my lord on his behalf and hope all will be wellTo do this is within the compass of man's wit and therefore I will attempt the doing itWhere should I lose that handkerchief EmiliaI know not madamBelieve me I had rather have lost my purse Full of crusadoes and but my noble Moor Is true of mind and made of no such baseness As jealous creatures are it were enough To put him to ill thinkingIs he not jealousWho he I think the sun where he was born Drew all such humors from him Look where he comesI will not leave him now till Cassio Be call'd to himOthello How is't with you my lordWell my good lady Aside O hardness to dissemble How do you DesdemonaWell my good lordGive me your hand This hand is moist my ladyIt yet has felt no age nor known no sorrowThis argues fruitfulness and liberal heart Hot hot and moist This hand of yours requires A sequester from liberty fasting and prayer Much castigation exercise devout For here's a young and sweating devil here That commonly rebels 'Tis a good hand A frank oneYou may indeed say so For 'twas that hand that gave away my heartA liberal hand The hearts of old gave hands But our new heraldry is hands not heartsI cannot speak of this Come now your promiseWhat promise chuckI have sent to bid Cassio come speak with youI have a salt and sorry rheum offends me Lend me thy handkerchiefHere my lordThat which I gave youI have it not about meNotNo faith my lordThat's a fault That handkerchief Did an Egyptian to my mother give She was a charmer and could almost read The thoughts of people She told her while she kept it 'Twould make her amiable and subdue my father Entirely to her love but if she lost it Or made a gift of it my father's eye Should hold her loathed and his spirits should hunt After new fancies She dying gave it me And bid me when my fate would have me wive To give it her I did so and take heed on't Make it a darling like your precious eye To lose't or give't away were such perdition As nothing else could matchIs't possible'Tis true there's magic in the web of it A sibyl that had number'd in the world The sun to course two hundred compasses In her prophetic fury sew'd the work The worms were hallow'd that did breed the silk And it was dyed in mummy which the skillful Conserved of maiden's hearts Indeed is't trueMost veritable therefore look to't wellThen would to God that I had never seen'tHa whereforeWhy do you speak so startingly and rashIs't lost is't gone speak is it out o' the wayHeaven bless usSay youIt is not lost but what an if it wereHowI say it is not lostFetch't let me see itWhy so I can sir but I will not now This is a trick to put me from my suit Pray you let Cassio be received againFetch me the handkerchief my mind misgivesCome come You'll never meet a more sufficient manThe handkerchiefI pray talk me of CassioThe handkerchiefA man that all his time Hath founded his good fortunes on your love Shared dangers with youThe handkerchiefIn sooth you are to blameAwayIs not this man jealousI ne'er saw this before Sure there's some wonder in this handkerchief I am most unhappy in the loss of it'Tis not a year or two shows us a man They are all but stomachs and we all but food They eat us hungerly and when they are full They belch us Look you Cassio and my husbandCassio and IagoThere is no other way 'tis she must do't And lo the happiness Go and importune herHow now good Cassio What's the news with youMadam my former suit I do beseech you That by your virtuous means I may again Exist and be a member of his love Whom I with all the office of my heart Entirely honor I would not be delay'd If my offense be of such mortal kind That nor my service past nor present sorrows Nor purposed merit in futurity Can ransom me into his love again But to know so must be my benefit So shall I clothe me in a forced content And shut myself up in some other course To Fortune's almsAlas thricegentle Cassio My advocation is not now in tune My lord is not my lord nor should I know him Were he in favor as in humor alter'd So help me every spirit sanctified As I have spoken for you all my best And stood within the blank of his displeasure For my free speech You must awhile be patient What I can do I will and more I will Than for myself I dare Let that suffice youIs my lord angryHe went hence but now And certainly in strange unquietnessCan he be angry I have seen the cannon When it hath blown his ranks into the air And like the devil from his very arm Puff'd his own brother And can he be angry Something of moment then I will go meet him There's matter in't indeed if he be angryI prithee do soIagoSomething sure of state Either from Venice or some unhatch'd practice Made demonstrable here in Cyprus to him Hath puddled his clear spirit and in such cases Men's natures wrangle with inferior things Though great ones are their object 'Tis even so For let our finger ache and it indues Our other healthful members even to that sense Of pain Nay we must think men are not gods Nor of them look for such observancy As fits the bridal Beshrew me much Emilia I was unhandsome warrior as I am Arraigning his unkindness with my soul But now I find I had suborn'd the witness And he's indicted falselyPray heaven it be state matters as you think And no conception nor no jealous toy Concerning youAlas the day I never gave him causeBut jealous souls will not be answer'd so They are not ever jealous for the cause But jealous for they are jealous 'Tis a monster Begot upon itself born on itselfHeaven keep that monster from Othello's mindLady amenI will go seek him Cassio walk hereabout If I do find him fit I'll move your suit And seek to effect it to my uttermostI humbly thank your ladyship Desdemona and EmiliaBiancaSave you friend Cassio What make you from home How is it with you my most fair Bianca I'faith sweet love I was coming to your houseAnd I was going to your lodging Cassio What keep a week away seven days and nights Eight score eight hours and lovers' absent hours More tedious than the dial eight score times O weary reckoning Pardon me Bianca I have this while with leaden thoughts been press'd But I shall in a more continuate time Strike off this score of absence Sweet Bianca Gives her Desdemona's handkerchief Take me this work out O Cassio whence came this This is some token from a newer friend To the felt absence now I feel a cause Is't come to this Well well Go to woman Throw your vile guesses in the devil's teeth From whence you have them You are jealous now That this is from some mistress some remembrance No by my faith Bianca Why whose is itI know not sweet I found it in my chamber I like the work well Ere it be demanded As like enough it will I'ld have it copied Take it and do't and leave me for this timeLeave you whereforeI do attend here on the general And think it no addition nor my wish To have him see me woman'dWhy I
