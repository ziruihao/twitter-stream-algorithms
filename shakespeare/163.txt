starts out of his dreamGive me another horse Bind up my wounds Have mercy Jesu Soft I did but dream O coward conscience how dost thou afflict me The lights burn blue It is now dead midnight Cold fearful drops stand on my trembling flesh What do I fear Myself There's none else by Richard loves Richard that is I amIs there a murderer here Noyes I am Then fly What from myself Great reason why Lest I revenge What myself upon myself Alack I love myself Wherefore For any good That I myself have done unto myself O no Alas I rather hate myself For hateful deeds committed by myself I am a villain yet I lie I am not Fool of thyself speak well Fool do not flatter My conscience hath a thousand several tongues And every tongue brings in a several tale And every tale condemns me for a villain Perjury perjury in the high'st degree Murder stern murder in the dir'st degree All several sins all us'd in each degree Throng to the bar crying all 'Guilty guilty' I shall despair There is no creature loves me And if I die no soul will pity me And wherefore should they since that I myself Find in myself no pity to myself Methought the souls of all that I had murder'd Came to my tent and every one did threat Tomorrow's vengeance on the head of RichardMy lordZounds who is thereRatcliff my lord 'tisThe early villagecock Hath twice done salutation to the morn Your friends are up and buckle on their armourO Ratcliff I have dream'd a fearful dream What think'st thouwill our friends prove all trueNo doubt my lordO Ratcliff I fear I fearNay good my lord be not afraid of shadows By the apostle Paul shadows tonight Have stuck more terror to the soul of Richard Than can the substance of ten thousand soldiers Armed in proof and led by shallow Richmond 'Tis not yet near day Come go with me Under our tents I'll play the eavesdropper To see if any mean to shrink from me the to sitting in his tentGood morrow RichmondCry mercy lords and watchful gentlemen That you have ta'en a tardy sluggard hereHow have you slept my lordThe sweetest sleep and fairestboding dreams That ever ent'red in a drowsy head Have I since your departure had my lords Methought their souls whose bodies Richard murder'd Came to my tent and cried on victory I promise you my soul is very jocund In the remembrance of so fair a dream How far into the morning is it lordsUpon the stroke of fourWhy then 'tis time to arm and give directionHis to hisMore than I have said loving countrymen The leisure and enforcement of the time Forbids to dwell upon yet remember this God and our good cause fight upon our side The prayers of holy saints and wronged souls Like highrear'd bulwarks stand before our faces Richard except those whom we fight against Had rather have us win than him they follow For what is he they follow Truly gentlemen A bloody tyrant and a homicide One rais'd in blood and one in blood establish'd One that made means to come by what he hath And slaughtered those that were the means to help him A base foul stone made precious by the foil Of England's chair where he is falsely set One that hath ever been God's enemy Then if you fight against God's enemy God will in justice ward you as his soldiers If you do sweat to put a tyrant down You sleep in peace the tyrant being slain If you do fight against your country's foes Your country's foes shall pay your pains the hire If you do fight in safeguard of your wives Your wives shall welcome home the conquerors If you do free your children from the sword Your children's children quits it in your age Then in the name of God and all these rights Advance your standards draw your willing swords For me the ransom of my bold attempt Shall be this cold corpse on the earth's cold face But if I thrive the gain of my attempt The least of you shall share his part thereof Sound drums and trumpets boldly and cheerfully God and Saint George Richmond and victory Re attendantsand forcesWhat said Northumberland as touching RichmondThat he was never trained up in armsHe said the truth and what said Surrey thenHe smil'd and said 'The better for our purpose' He was in the right and so indeed it isClock strikes Tell the clock there Give me a calendar Who saw the sun todayNot I my lordThen he disdains to shine for by the book He should have brav'd the east an hour ago A black day will it be to somebody RatcliffMy lordThe sun will not be seen today The sky doth frown and lour upon our army I would these dewy tears were from the ground Not shine today Why what is that to me More than to Richmond For the selfsame heaven That frowns on me looks sadly upon him Arm arm my lord the foe vaunts in the fieldCome bustle bustle caparison my horse Call up Lord Stanley bid him bring his power I will lead forth my soldiers to the plain And thus my battle shall be ordered My foreward shall be drawn out all in length Consisting equally of horse and foot Our archers shall be placed in the midst John Duke of Norfolk Thomas Earl of Surrey Shall have the leading of this foot and horse They thus directed we will follow In the main battle whose puissance on either side Shall be well winged with our chiefest horse This and Saint George to boot What think'st thou NorfolkA good direction warlike sovereign This found I on my tent this morning He sheweth him a paper Reads 'Jockey of Norfolk be not so bold For Dickon thy master is bought and sold' A thing devised by the enemy Go gentlemen every man unto his charge Let not our babbling dreams affright our souls Conscience is but a word that cowards use Devis'd at first to keep the strong in awe Our strong arms be our conscience swords our law March on join bravely let us to it pellmell If not to heaven then hand in hand to hell His to hisWhat shall I say more than I have inferr'd Remember whom you are to cope withal A sort of vagabonds rascals and runaways A scum of Britaines and base lackey peasants Whom their o'ercloyed country vomits forth To desperate adventures and assur'd destruction You sleeping safe they bring to you unrest You having lands and bless'd with beauteous wives They would restrain the one distain the other And who doth lead them but a paltry fellow Long kept in Britaine at our mother's cost A milksop one that never in his life Felt so much cold as over shoes in snow Let's whip these stragglers o'er the seas again Lash hence these overweening rags of France These famish'd beggars weary of their lives Who but for dreaming on this fond exploit For want of means poor rats had hang'd themselves If we be conquered let men conquer us And not these bastard Britaines whom our fathers Have in their own land beaten bobb'd and thump'd And in record left them the heirs of shame Shall these enjoy our lands lie with our wives Ravish our daughtersDrum afar offHark I hear their drum Fight gentlemen of England Fight bold yeomen Draw archers draw your arrows to the head Spur your proud horses hard and ride in blood Amaze the welkin with your broken stavesaWhat says Lord Stanley Will he bring his powerMy lord he doth deny to comeOff with his son George's headMy lord the enemy is pass'd the marsh After the battle let George Stanley dieA thousand hearts are great within my bosom Advance our standards set upon our foes Our ancient word of courage fair Saint George Inspire us with the spleen of fiery dragons Upon them Victory sits on our helmsAnother part of the field Alarum excursionsand forces to him Rescue my Lord of Norfolk rescue rescue The King enacts more wonders than a man Daring an opposite to every danger His horse is slain and all on foot he fights Seeking for Richmond in the throat of death Rescue fair lord or else the day is lostAlarumsA horse a horse my kingdom for a horseWithdraw my lord I'll help you to a horseSlave I have set my life upon a cast And I Will stand the hazard of the die I think there be six Richmonds in the field Five have I slain today instead of him A horse a horse my kingdom for a horseAnother part of the field Alarumandthey fight is slain Retreat and flourish bearing the crown with other God and your arms be prais'd victorious friends The day is ours the bloody dog is deadCourageous Richmond well hast thou acquit thee Lo here this longusurped royalty From the dead temples of this bloody wretch Have I pluck'd off to grace thy brows withal Wear it enjoy it and make much of itGreat God of heaven say Amen to all But te me is young George Stanley livingHe is my lord and safe in Leicester town Whither if it please you we may now withdraw usWhat men of name are slain on either sideJohn Duke of Norfolk Walter Lord Ferrers Sir Robert Brakenbury and Sir William BrandonInter their bodies as becomes their births Proclaim a pardon to the soldiers fled That in submission will return to us And then as we have ta'en the sacrament We will unite the white rose and the red Smile heaven upon this fair conjunction That long have frown'd upon their emnity What traitor hears me and says not Amen England hath long been mad and scarr'd herself The brother blindly shed the brother's blood The father rashly slaughter'd his own son The son compell'd been butcher to the sire All this divided York and Lancaster Divided in their dire division O now let Richmond and Elizabeth The true succeeders of each royal house By God's fair ordinance conjoin together And let their heirs God if thy will be so Enrich the time to come with smoothfac'd peace With smiling plenty and fair prosperous days Abate the edge of traitors gracious Lord That would reduce these bloody days again And make poor England weep in streams of blood Let them not live to taste this land's increase That would with treason wound this fair land's peace Now civil wounds are stopp'd peace lives again That she may long live here God say Amen
