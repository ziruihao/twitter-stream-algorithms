SpeakHere in your city I now came from him I speak amazedly and it becomes My marvel and my message To your court Whiles he was hast'ning in the chase it seems Of this fair couple meets he on the way The father of this seeming lady and Her brother having both their country quitted With this young princeCamillo has betray'd me Whose honour and whose honesty till now Endur'd all weathersLay't so to his charge He's with the King your fatherWho CamilloCamillo sir I spake with him who now Has these poor men in question Never saw I Wretches so quake They kneel they kiss the earth Forswear themselves as often as they speak Bohemia stops his ears and threatens them With divers deaths in deathO my poor father The heaven sets spies upon us will not have Our contract celebratedYou are marriedWe are not sir nor are we like to be The stars I see will kiss the valleys first The odds for high and low's alikeMy lord Is this the daughter of a kingShe is When once she is my wifeThat 'once' I see by

do now With thought of such affections Step forth mine advocate at your request My father will grant precious things as triflesWould he do so I'd beg your precious mistress Which he counts but a trifleSir my liege Your eye hath too much youth in't Not a month Fore your queen died she was more worth such gazes Than what you look on nowI thought of her Even in these looks I madeTo But your petition Is yet unanswer'd I will to your father Your honour not o'erthrown by your desires I am friend to them and you Upon which errand I now go toward him therefore follow me And mark what way I make Come good my lord Sicilia Before the palace of and a Beseech you sir were you present at this relationI was by at the opening of the fardel heard the old shepherd deliver the manner how he found it whereupon after a little amazedness we were all commanded out of the chamber only this methought I heard the shepherd say he found the childI would most gladly know the issue of itI make a broken delivery of the business but the changes I perceived in the King and Camillo were very notes of admiration They seem'd almost with staring on one another to tear the cases of their eyes there was speech in their dumbness language in their very gesture they look'd as they had heard of a world ransom'd or one destroyed A notable passion of wonder appeared in them but the wisest beholder that knew no more but seeing could not say if th' importance were joy or sorrow but in the extremity of the one it must needs beanotherHere comes a gentleman that happily knows more The news RogeroNothing but bonfires The oracle is fulfill'd the King's daughter is found Such a deal of wonder is broken out within this hour that balladmakers cannot be able to express itanotherHere comes the Lady Paulina's steward he can deliver you more How goes it now sir This news which is call'd true is so like an old tale that the verity of it is in strong suspicion Has the King found his heirMost true if ever truth were pregnant by circumstance That which you hear you'll swear you see there is such unity in the proofs The mantle of Queen Hermione's her jewel about the neck of it the letters of Antigonus found with it which they know to be his character the majesty of the creature in resemblance of the mother the affection of nobleness which nature shows above her breeding and many other evidences proclaim her with all certainty to be the King's daughter Did you see the meeting of the two kingsNoThen you have lost a sight which was to be seen cannot be spoken of There might you have beheld one joy crown another so and in such manner that it seem'd sorrow wept to take leave of them for their joy waded in tears There was casting up of eyes holding up of hands with countenance of such distraction that they were to be known by garment not by favour Our king being ready to leap out of himself for joy of his found daughter as if that joy were now become a loss cries 'O thy mother thy mother' then asks Bohemia forgiveness then embraces his soninlaw then again worries he his daughter with clipping her Now he thanks the old shepherd which stands by like a weatherbitten conduit of many kings' reigns I never heard of such another encounter which lames report to follow it and undoes description to do itWhat pray you became of Antigonus that carried hence the childLike an old tale still which will have matter to rehearse though credit be asleep and not an ear open he was torn to pieces with a bear This avouches the shepherd's son who has not only his innocence which seems much to justify him but a handkerchief and rings of his that Paulina knowsWhat became of his bark and his followersWreck'd the same instant of their master's death and in the view of the shepherd so that all the instruments which aided to expose the child were even then lost when it was found But O the noble combat that 'twixt joy and sorrow was fought in Paulina She had one eye declin'd for the loss of her husband another elevated that the oracle was fulfill'd She lifted the Princess from the earth and so locks her in embracing as if she would pin her to her heart that she might no more be in danger of losingThe dignity of this act was worth the audience of kings and princes for by such was it actedOne of the prettiest touches of all and that which angl'd for mine eyes caught the water though not the fish was when at the relation of the Queen's death with the manner how she came to't bravely confess'd and lamented by the King how attentivenes wounded his daughter till from one sign of dolour to another she did with an 'Alas' I would fain say bleed tears for I am sure my heart wept blood Who was most marble there changed colour some swooned all sorrowed If all the world could have seen't the woe had been universalAre they returned to the courtNo The Princess hearing of her mother's statue which is in the keeping of Paulina a piece many years in doing and now newly perform'd by that rare Italian master Julio Romano who had he himself eternity and could put breath into his work would beguile nature of her custom so perfectly he is her ape He so near to Hermione hath done Hermione that they say one would speak to her and stand in hope of answer thither with all greediness of affection are they gone and there they intend to supI thought she had some great matter there in hand for she hath privately twice or thrice a day ever since the death of Hermione visited that removed house Shall we thither and with our company piece the rejoicingWho would be thence that has the benefit of access Every wink of an eye some new grace will be born Our absence makes us unthrifty to our knowledge Let's alongNow had I not the dash of my former life in me would preferment drop on my head I brought the old man and his son aboard the Prince told him I heard them talk of a fardel and I know not what but he at that time overfond of the shepherd's daughter so he then took her to be who began to be much seasick and himself little better extremity of weather continuing this mystery remained undiscover'd But 'tis all one to me for had I been the finderout of this secret it would not have relish'd among my other discreditsandHere come those I have done good to against my will and already appearing in the blossoms of their fortuneCome boy I am past moe children but thy sons and daughters will be all gentlemen bornYou are well met sir You denied to fight with me this other day because I was no gentleman born See you these clothes Say you see them not and think me still no gentleman born You were best say these robes are not gentlemen born Give me the lie do and try whether I am not now a gentleman bornI know you are now sir a gentleman bornAy and have been so any time these four hoursAnd so have I boySo you have but I was a gentleman born before my father for the King's son took me by the hand and call'd me brother and then the two kings call'd my father brother and then the Prince my brother and the Princess my sister call'd my father father And so we wept and there was the first gentlemanlike tears that ever we shedWe may live son to shed many moreAy or else 'twere hard luck being in so preposterous estate as we areI humbly beseech you sir to pardon me all the faults I have committed to your worship and to give me your good report to the Prince my masterPrithee son do for we must be gentle now we are gentlemenThou wilt amend thy lifeAy an it like your good worshipGive me thy hand I will swear to the Prince thou art as honest a true fellow as any is in BohemiaYou may say it but not swear itNot swear it now I am a gentleman Let boors and franklins say it I'll swear itHow if it be false sonIf it be ne'er so false a true gentleman may swear it in the behalf of his friend And I'll swear to the Prince thou art a tall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt not be drunk but I know thou art no tall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt be drunk But I'll swear it and I would thou wouldst be a tall fellow of thy handsI will prove so sir to my powerAy by any means prove a tall fellow If I do not wonder how thou dar'st venture to be drunk not being a tall fellow trust me not Hark the kings and the princes our kindred are going to see the Queen's picture Come follow us we'll be thy good masters Sicilia A chapel in 's houseand O grave and good Paulina the great comfort That I have had of theeWhat sovereign sir I did not well I meant well All my services You have paid home but that you have vouchsaf'd With your crown'd brother and these your contracted Heirs of your kingdoms my poor house to visit It is a surplus of your grace which never My life may last to answerO Paulina We honour you with trouble but we came To see the statue of our queen Your gallery Have we pass'd through not without much content In many singularities but we saw not That which my daughter came to look upon The statue of her motherAs she liv'd peerless So her dead likeness I do well believe Excels whatever yet you look'd upon Or hand of man hath done therefore I keep it Lonely apart But here it is Prepare To see the life as lively mock'd as ever Still sleep mock'd death Behold and say 'tis well draws a curtain and discovers standing like a statue I like your silence it the more shows off Your wonder but yet speak First you my liege Comes it not something nearHer natural posture Chide me dear stone that I may say indeed Thou art Hermione or rather thou art she In thy not chiding for she was as tender As infancy and grace But yet Paulina Hermione was not so much wrinkled nothing So aged as this seemsO not by muchSo much the more our carver's excellence Which lets go by some sixteen years and makes her As she liv'd nowAs now she might have done So much to my good comfort as it is Now piercing to my soul O thus she stood Even with such life of majesty warm life As now it coldly stands when first I woo'd her I am asham'd Does not the stone rebuke me For being more stone than it O royal piece There's magic in thy majesty which has My evils conjur'd to remembrance and From thy admiring daughter took the spirits Standing like stone with theeAnd give me leave And do not say 'tis superstition that I kneel and then implore her blessing Lady Dear queen that ended when I but began Give me that hand of yours to kissO patience The statue is but newly fix'd the colour's Not dryMy lord your sorrow was too sore laid on Which sixteen winters cannot blow away So many summers dry Scarce any joy Did ever so long live no sorrow But kill'd itself much soonerDear my brother Let him that was the cause of this have pow'r To take off so much grief from you as he Will piece up in himselfIndeed my lord If I had thought the sight of my poor image Would thus have wrought you for the stone is mine I'd not have show'd itDo not draw the curtainNo longer shall you gaze on't lest your fancy May think anon it movesLet be let be Would I were dead but that methinks already What was he that did make it See my lord Would you not deem it breath'd and that those veins Did verily bear bloodMasterly done The very life seems warm upon her lipThe fixture of her eye has motion in't As we are mock'd with artI'll draw the curtain My lord's almost so far transported that He'll think anon it livesO sweet Paulina Make me to think so twenty years together No settled senses of the world can match The pleasure of that madness Let 't aloneI am sorry sir I have thus far stirr'd you but I could afflict you fartherDo Paulina For this affliction has a taste as sweet As any cordial comfort Still methinks There is an air comes from her What fine chisel Could ever yet cut breath Let no man mock me For I will kiss herGood my lord forbear The ruddiness upon her lip is wet You'll mar it if you kiss it stain your own With oily painting Shall I draw the curtainNo not these twenty yearsSo long could I Stand by a lookeronEither forbear Quit presently the chapel or resolve you For more amazement If you can behold it I'll make the statue move indeed descend And take you by the hand but then you'll think Which I protest against I am assisted By wicked powersWhat you can make her do I am content to look on what to speak I am content to hear for 'tis as easy To make her speak as moveIt is requir'd You do awake
