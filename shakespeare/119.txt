gracesCondemn the fault and not the actor of it Why every fault's condemn'd ere it be done Mine were the very cipher of a function To fine the faults whose fine stands in record And let go by the actorO just but severe law I had a brother then Heaven keep your honourToGive't not o'er so to him again entreat him Kneel down before him hang upon his gown You are too cold if you should need a pin You could not with more tame a tongue desire it To him I sayMust he needs dieMaiden no remedyYes I do think that you might pardon him And neither heaven nor man grieve at the mercyI will not do'tBut

are too coldToo late Why no I that do speak a word May call it back again Well believe this No ceremony that to great ones longs Not the king's crown nor the deputed sword The marshal's truncheon nor

goneI would to heaven I had your potency And you were Isabel Should it then be thus No I would tell what 'twere to be a judge And what a prisonerToAy touch him there's the veinYour brother is a forfeit of the law And you but waste your wordsAlas Alas Why all the souls that were were forfeit once And He that might the vantage best have took Found out the remedy How would you be If He which is the top of judgment should But judge you as you are O think on that And mercy then will breathe within your lips Like man new madeBe you content fair maid It is the law not I condemn your brother Were he my kinsman brother or my son It should be thus with him He must die tomorrowTomorrow O that's sudden Spare him spare him He's not prepar'd for death Even for our kitchens We kill the fowl of season shall we serve heaven With less respect than we do minister To our gross selves Good good my lord bethink you Who is it that hath died for this offence There's many have committed itAside Ay well saidThe law hath not been dead though it hath slept Those many had not dar'd to do that evil If the first that did th' edict infringe Had answer'd for his deed Now 'tis awake Takes note of what is done and like a prophet Looks in a glass that shows what future evils Either now or by remissness new conceiv'd And so in progress to be hatch'd and born Are now to have no successive degrees But here they live to endYet show some pityI show it most of all when I show justice For then I pity those I do not know Which a dismiss'd offence would after gall And do him right that answering one foul wrong Lives not to act another Be satisfied Your brother dies tomorrow be contentSo you must be the first that gives this sentence And he that suffers O it is excellent To have a giant's strength But it is tyrannous To use it like a giantToThat's well saidCould great men thunder As Jove himself does Jove would never be quiet For every pelting petty officer Would use his heaven for thunder Nothing but thunder Merciful Heaven Thou rather with thy sharp and sulphurous bolt Splits the unwedgeable and gnarled oak Than the soft myrtle But man proud man Dress'd in a little brief authority Most ignorant of what he's most assur'd His glassy essence like an angry ape Plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven As makes the angels weep who with our speens Would all themselves laugh mortalToO to him to him wench He will relent He's coming I perceive 'tAside Pray heaven she win himWe cannot weigh our brother with ourself Great men may jest with saints 'tis wit in them But in the less foul profanationToThou'rt i' th' right girl more o' thatThat in the captain's but a choleric word Which in the soldier is flat blasphemyToArt avis'd o' that More on'tWhy do you put these sayings upon meBecause authority though it err like others Hath yet a kind of medicine in itself That skins the vice o' th' top Go to your bosom Knock there and ask your heart what it doth know That's like my brother's fault If it confess A natural guiltiness such as is his Let it not sound a thought upon your tongue Against my brother's lifeAside She speaks and 'tis Such sense that my sense breeds with it Fare you wellGentle my lord turn backI will bethink me Come again tomorrowHark how I'll bribe you good my lord turn backHow bribe meAy with such gifts that heaven shall share with youToYou had marr'd all elseNot with fond sicles of the tested gold Or stones whose rate are either rich or poor As fancy values them but with true prayers That shall be up at heaven andthere Ere sunrise prayers from preserved souls From fasting maids whose minds are dedicate To nothing temporalWell come to me tomorrowToGo to 'tis well awayHeaven keep your honour safeAside Amen for I Am that way going to temptation Where prayers crossAt what hour tomorrow Shall I attend your lordshipAt any time 'fore noonSave your honour all but From thee even from thy virtue What's this what's this Is this her fault or mine The tempter or the tempted who sins most Ha Not she nor doth she tempt but it is I That lying by the violet in the sun Do as the carrion does not as the flow'r Corrupt with virtuous season Can it be That modesty may more betray our sense Than woman's lightness Having waste ground enough Shall we desire to raze the sanctuary And pitch our evils there O fie fie fie What dost thou or what art thou Angelo Dost thou desire her foully for those things That make her good O let her brother live Thieves for their robbery have authority When judges steal themselves What do I love her That I desire to hear her speak again And feast upon her eyes What is't I dream on O cunning enemy that to catch a saint With saints dost bait thy hook Most dangerous Is that temptation that doth goad us on To sin in loving virtue Never could the strumpet With all her double vigour art and nature Once stir my temper but this virtuous maid Subdues me quite Ever till now When men were fond I smil'd and wond'red howA prisonseverallydisguised as aand Hail to you Provost so I think you areI am the Provost What's your will good friarBound by my charity and my blest order I come to visit the afflicted spirits Here in the prison Do me the common right To let me see them and to make me know The nature of their crimes that I may minister To them accordinglyI would do more than that if more were needful Look here comes one a gentlewoman of mine Who falling in the flaws of her own youth Hath blister'd her report She is with child And he that got it sentenc'd a young man More fit to do another such offence Than die for thisWhen must he dieAs I do think tomorrow ToI have provided for you stay awhile And you shall be conductedRepent you fair one of the sin you carryI do and bear the shame most patientlyI'll teach you how you shall arraign your conscience And try your penitence if it be sound Or hollowly put onI'll gladly learnLove you the man that wrong'd youYes as I love the woman that wrong'd himSo then it seems your most offenceful act Was mutually committedMutuallyThen was your sin of heavier kind than hisI do confess it and repent it father'Tis meet so daughter but lest you do repent As that the sin hath brought you to this shame Which sorrow is always toward ourselves not heaven Showing we would not spare heaven as we love it But as we stand in fearI do repent me as it is an evil And take the shame with joyThere rest Your partner as I hear must die tomorrow And I am going with instruction to him Grace go with you BenediciteMust die tomorrow O injurious law That respites me a life whose very comfort Is still a dying horror'Tis pity of him houseWhen I would pray and think I think and pray To several subjects Heaven hath my empty words Whilst my invention hearing not my tongue Anchors on Isabel Heaven in my mouth As if I did but only chew his name And in my heart the strong and swelling evil Of my conception The state whereon I studied Is like a good thing being often read Grown sere and tedious yea my gravity Wherein let no man hear me I take pride Could I with boot change for an idle plume Which the air beats for vain O place O form How often dost thou with thy case thy habit Wrench awe from fools and tie the wiser souls To thy false seeming Blood thou art blood Let's write 'good angel' on the devil's horn 'Tis not the devil's crestHow now who's thereOne Isabel a sister desires access to youTeach her the way O heavens Why does my blood thus muster to my heart Making both it unable for itself And dispossessing all my other parts Of necessary fitness So play the foolish throngs with one that swoons Come all to help him and so stop the air By which he should revive and even so The general subject to a wellwish'd king Quit their own part and in obsequious fondness Crowd to his presence where their untaught love Must needs appear offence How now fair maidI am come to know your pleasureThat you might know it would much better please me Than to demand what 'tis Your brother cannot liveEven so Heaven keep your honourYet may he live awhile and it may be As long as you or I yet he must dieUnder your sentenceYeaWhen I beseech you that in his reprieve Longer or shorter he may be so fitted That his soul sicken notHa Fie these filthy vices It were as good To pardon him that hath from nature stol'n A man already made as to remit Their saucy sweetness that do coin heaven's image In stamps that are forbid 'tis all as easy Falsely to take away a life true made As to put metal in restrained means To make a false one'Tis set down so in heaven but not in earthSay you so Then I shall pose you quickly Which had you rather that the most just law Now took your brother's life or to redeem him Give up your body to such sweet uncleanness As she that he hath stain'dSir believe this I had rather give my body than my soulI talk not of your soul our compell'd sins Stand more for number than for accomptHow say youNay I'll not warrant that for I can speak Against the thing I say Answer to this I now the voice of the recorded law Pronounce a sentence on your brother's life Might there not be a charity in sin To save this brother's lifePlease you to do't I'll take it as a peril to my soul It is no sin at all but charityPleas'd you to do't at peril of your soul Were equal poise of sin and charityThat I do beg his life if it be sin Heaven let me bear it You granting of my suit If that be sin I'll make it my morn prayer To have it added to the faults of mine And nothing of your answerNay but hear me Your sense pursues not mine either you are ignorant Or seem so craftily and that's not goodLet me be ignorant and in nothing good But graciously to know I am no betterThus wisdom wishes to appear most bright When it doth tax itself as these black masks Proclaim an enshielded beauty ten times louder Than beauty could display'd But mark me To be received plain I'll speak more gross Your brother is to dieSoAnd his offence is so as it appears Accountant to the law upon that painTrueAdmit no other way to save his life As I subscribe not that nor any other But in the loss of question that you his sister Finding yourself desir'd of such a person Whose credit with the judge or own great place Could fetch your brother from the manacles Of the allbinding law and that there were No earthly mean to save him but that either You must lay down the treasures of your body To this supposed or else to let him suffer What would you doAs much for my poor brother as myself That is were I under the terms of death Th' impression of keen whips I'd wear as rubies And strip myself to death as to a bed That longing have been sick for ere I'd yield My body up to shameThen must your brother dieAnd 'twere the cheaper way Better it were a brother died at once Than that a sister by redeeming him Should die for everWere not you then as cruel as the sentence That you have slander'd soIgnominy in ransom and free pardon Are of two houses lawful mercy Is nothing kin to foul redemptionYou seem'd of late to make the law a tyrant And rather prov'd the sliding of your brother A merriment than a viceO pardon me my lord It oft falls out To have what we would have we speak not what we mean I something do excuse the thing I hate For his advantage that I dearly loveWe are all frailElse let my brother die If not a fedary but only he Owe and succeed thy weaknessNay women are frail tooAy as the glasses where they view themselves Which are as easy broke as they make forms Women help heaven Men their creation mar In profiting by them Nay call us ten times frail For we are soft as our complexions are And credulous to false printsI think it well And from this testimony of your own sex Since I suppose we are made to be no stronger Than faults may shake our frames let me be bold I do arrest your words Be that you are That is a woman if you be more you're none If you be one as you are well express'd By all external warrants show it now By putting on the destin'd liveryI have no tongue but one gentle my lord Let me intreat you speak the former languagePlainly conceive I love youMy brother did love Juliet And you tell me that he shall die for'tHe shall not Isabel if you give me loveI know your virtue hath a license in't Which seems a little fouler than it is To pluck on othersBelieve me on mine honour My words express my purposeHa little honour to be much believ'd And most pernicious purpose Seeming seeming I will proclaim thee Angelo look for't Sign me a present pardon for my brother Or with an outstretch'd throat I'll tell the world aloud What man thou artWho will believe thee Isabel My unsoil'd name th' austereness of my life My vouch against you and my place i' th' state Will so your accusation overweigh That you shall stifle in your own report And smell of calumny I have begun And now I give my sensual race the rein Fit thy consent to my sharp appetite Lay by all nicety and prolixious blushes That banish what they sue for redeem thy brother By yielding up thy body to my will Or else he must not only die the death But thy unkindness shall his death draw out To ling'ring sufferance Answer me tomorrow Or by the affection that now guides me most I'll prove a tyrant to him As for you Say what you can my false o'erweighs your trueTo whom should I complain Did I tell this Who would believe me O perilous mouths That bear in them one and the selfsame tongue Either of condemnation or approof Bidding the law make curtsy to their will Hooking both right and wrong to th' appetite To follow as it draws I'll to my brother Though he hath fall'n by prompture of the blood Yet hath he in him such a mind of honour That had he twenty heads to tender down On twenty bloody blocks he'd yield them up Before his sister should her body stoop To such abhorr'd pollution Then Isabel live chaste and brother die More than our brother is our chastity I'll tell him yet of Angelo's request And fit his mind to death for his soul's rest
