Troy Beforepalacearmed and Call here my varlet I'll unarm again Why should I war without the walls of Troy That find such cruel battle here within Each Troyan that is master of his heart Let him to field Troilus alas hath noneWill this gear ne'er be mendedThe Greeks are strong and skilful to their strength Fierce to their skill and to their fierceness valiant But I am weaker than a woman's tear Tamer than sleep fonder than ignorance Less valiant than the virgin in the night And skilless as unpractis'd infancyWell I have told you enough of this for my part I'll not meddle nor make no farther He that will have a cake out of the wheat must needs tarry the grindingHave I not tarriedAy the grinding but you must tarry the boltingHave I not tarriedAy the bolting but you must tarry the leaveningStill have I tarriedAy to the leavening but here's yet in the word 'hereafter' the kneading the making of the cake the heating of the oven and the baking nay you must stay the cooling too or you may chance to burn your lipsPatience herself what goddess e'er she be Doth lesser blench at suff'rance than I do At Priam's royal table do I sit And when fair Cressid comes into my thoughts So traitor then she comes when she is thenceWell she look'd yesternight fairer than ever I saw her look or any woman elseI was about to tell thee when my heart As wedged with a sigh would rive in twain Lest Hector or my father should perceive me I have as when the sun doth light a storm Buried this sigh in wrinkle of a smile But sorrow that is couch'd in seeming gladness Is like that mirth fate turns to sudden sadnessAn her hair were not somewhat darker than Helen's well go to there were no more comparison between the women But for my part she is my kinswoman I would not as they term it praise her but I would somebody had heard her talk yesterday as I did Iwill not dispraise your sister Cassandra's wit butO Pandarus I tell thee Pandarus When I do tell thee there my hopes lie drown'd Reply not in how many fathoms deep They lie indrench'd I tell thee I am mad In Cressid's love Thou answer'st he is fair' Pourest in the open ulcer of my heart Her eyes her hair her cheek her gait her voice Handlest in thy discourse O that her hand In whose comparison all whites are ink Writing their own reproach to whose soft seizure The cygnet's down is harsh and spirit of sense Hard as the palm of ploughman This thou tell'st me As true thou tell'st me when I say I love her But saying thus instead of oil and balm Thou lay'st in every gash that love hath given me The knife that made itI speak no more than truthThou dost not speak so muchFaith I'll not meddle in it Let her be as she is if she be fair 'tis the better for her an she be not she has the mends in her own handsGood Pandarus How now PandarusI have had my labour for my travail ill thought on of her and ill thought on of you gone between and between but small thanks for my labourWhat art thou angry Pandarus What with meBecause she's kin to me therefore she's not so fair as Helen An she were not kin to me she would be as fair a Friday as Helen is on Sunday But what care I I care not an she were a blackamoor 'tis all one to meSay I she is not fairI do not care whether you do or no She's a fool to stay behind her father Let her to the Greeks and so I'll tell her the next time I see her For my part I'll meddle nor make no more i' th' matterPandarusNot Sweet PandarusPray you speak no more to me I will leave all as I found it and there an endSound alarumPeace you ungracious clamours Peace rude sounds Fools on both sides Helen must needs be fair When with your blood you daily paint her thus I cannot fight upon this argument It is too starv'd a subject for my sword But PandarusO gods how do you plague me I cannot come to Cressid but by Pandar And he's as tetchy to be woo'd to woo As she is stubbornchaste against all suit Tell me Apollo for thy Daphne's love What Cressid is what Pandar and what we Her bed is India there she lies a pearl Between our Ilium and where she resides Let it be call'd the wild and wand'ring flood Ourself the merchant and this sailing Pandar Our doubtful hope our convoy and our bark

or have no legsThis man lady hath robb'd many beasts of their particular additions he is as valiant as a lion churlish as the bear slow as the elephanta man into whom nature hath so crowded humours that his valour is crush'd into folly his folly sauced with discretion There is no man hath a virtue that he hath not a glimpse of nor any man an attaint but he carries some stain of it he is melancholy without cause and merry against the hair he hath the joints of every thing but everything so out of joint that he is a gouty Briareus many hands and no use or purblind Argus all eyes and no sightBut how should this man that makes me smile make Hector angryThey say he yesterday cop'd Hector in the battle and struck him down the disdain and shame whereof hath ever since kept Hector fasting

neitherNo but brownFaith to say truth brown and not brownTo say the truth true and not trueShe prais'd his complexion above ParisWhy Paris hath colour enoughSo he hasThen Troilus should have too much If she prais'd him above his complexion is higher than his he having colour enough and the other higher is too flaming praise for a good complexion I had as lief Helen's golden tongue had commended Troilus for a copper noseI swear to you I think Helen loves him better than ParisThen she's a merry Greek indeedNay I am sure she does She came to him th' other day into the compass'd windowand you know he has not past three or four hairs on his chinIndeed a tapster's arithmetic may soon bring his particulars therein to a totalWhy he is very young and yet will he within three pound lift as much as his brother HectorIs he so young a man and so old a lifterBut to prove to you that Helen loves him she came and puts me her white hand to his cloven chinJuno have mercy How came it clovenWhy you

TroilusTroilus will stand to the proof if you'll prove it soTroilus Why he esteems her no more than I esteem an addle eggIf you love an addle egg as well as you love an idle head you would eat chickens i' th' shellI cannot choose but laugh to think how she tickled his chin Indeed she has a marvell's white hand I must needs confessWithout the rackAnd she takes upon her to spy a white hair on his chinAlas poor chin Many a wart is richerBut there was such laughing Queen Hecuba laugh'd that her eyes ran o'erWith millstonesAnd Cassandra laugh'dBut there was a more temperate fire under the pot of her eyes Did her eyes run o'er tooAnd Hector laugh'dAt what was all this laughingMarry at the white hair that Helen spied on Troilus' chinAn't had been a green hair I should have laugh'd tooThey laugh'd not so much at the hair as at his pretty answerWhat was his answerQuoth she 'Here's but two and fifty hairs on your chin and one of them is white'This is her questionThat's true make no question of that 'Two and fifty hairs' quoth he 'and one white That white hair is my father and all the rest are his sons' 'Jupiter' quoth she 'which of these hairs is Paris my husband' 'The forked one' quoth he 'pluck't out and give it him' But there was such laughing and Helen so blush'd and Paris so chaf'd and all the rest so laugh'd that it pass'dSo let it now for it has been a great while

Beforetent Sennet and othersPrinces What grief hath set these jaundies o'er your cheeks The ample proposition that hope makes In all designs begun on earth below Fails in the promis'd largeness checks and disasters Grow in the veins of actions highest rear'd As knots by the conflux of meeting sap Infects the sound pine and diverts his grain Tortive and errant from his course of growth Nor princes is it matter new to us That we come short of our suppose so far That after seven years' siege yet Troy walls stand Sith every action that hath gone before Whereof we have record trial did draw Bias and thwart not answering the aim And that unbodied figure of the thought That gave't surmised shape Why then you princes Do you with cheeks abash'd behold our works And call them shames which are indeed nought else But the protractive trials of great Jove To find persistive constancy in men The fineness of which metal is not found In fortune's love For then the bold and coward The wise and fool the artist and unread The hard and soft seem all affin'd and kin But in the wind and tempest of her frown Distinction with a broad and powerful fan Puffing at all winnows the light away And what hath mass or matter by itself Lies rich in virtue and unmingledWith due observance of thy godlike seat Great Agamemnon Nestor shall apply Thy latest words In the reproof of chance Lies the true proof of men The sea being smooth How many shallow bauble boats dare sail Upon her patient breast making their way With those of nobler bulk But let the ruffian Boreas once enrage The gentle Thetis and anon behold The strongribb'd bark through liquid mountains cut Bounding between the two moist elements Like Perseus' horse Where's then the saucy boat Whose weak untimber'd sides but even now Corivall'd greatness Either to harbour fled Or made a toast for Neptune Even so Doth valour's show and valour's worth divide In storms of fortune for in her ray and brightness The herd hath more annoyance by the breeze Than by the tiger but when the splitting wind Makes flexible the knees of knotted oaks And flies fled under shadewhy then the thing of courage As rous'd with rage with rage doth sympathise And with an accent tun'd in selfsame key Retorts to chiding fortuneAgamemnon Thou great commander nerve and bone of Greece Heart of our numbers soul and only spirit In whom the tempers and the minds of all Should be shut uphear what Ulysses speaks Besides the applause and approbation The which Tomost mighty for thy place and sway ToAnd thou most reverend for thy stretch'dout life I give to both your speeches which were such As Agamemnon and the hand of Greece Should hold up high in brass and such again As venerable Nestor hatch'd in silver Should with a bond of air strong as the axletree On which heaven rides knit all the Greekish ears To his experienc'd tongueyet let it please both Thou great and wise to hear Ulysses speakSpeak Prince of Ithaca and be't of less expect That matter needless of importless burden Divide thy lips than we are confident When rank Thersites opes his mastic jaws We shall hear music wit and oracleTroy yet upon his basis had been down And the great Hector's sword had lack'd a master But for these instances The specialty of rule hath been neglected And look how many Grecian tents do stand Hollow upon this plain so many hollow factions When that the general is not like the hive To whom the foragers shall all repair What honey is expected Degree being vizarded Th' unworthiest shows as fairly in the mask The heavens themselves the planets and this centre Observe degree priority and place Insisture course proportion season form Office and custom in all line of order And therefore is the glorious planet Sol In noble eminence enthron'd and spher'd Amidst the other whose med'cinable eye Corrects the ill aspects of planets evil And posts like the commandment of a king Sans check to good and bad But when the planets In evil mixture to disorder wander What plagues and what portents what mutiny What raging of the sea shaking of earth Commotion in the winds Frights changes horrors Divert and crack rend and deracinate The unity and married calm of states Quite from their fixture O when degree is shak'd Which is the ladder of all high designs The prise is sick How could communities Degrees in schools and brotherhoods in cities Peaceful commerce from dividable shores The primogenity and due of birth Prerogative of age crowns sceptres laurels But by degree stand in authentic place Take but degree away untune that string And hark what discord follows Each thing melts In mere oppugnancy the bounded waters Should lift their bosoms higher than the shores And make a sop of all this solid globe Strength should be lord of imbecility And the rude son should strike his father dead Force should be right or rather right and wrong Between whose endless jar justice resides Should lose their names and so should justice too Then everything includes itself in power Power into will will into appetite And appetite an universal wolf So doubly seconded with will and power Must make perforce an universal prey And last eat up himself Great Agamemnon This chaos when degree is suffocate Follows the choking And this neglection of degree it is That by a pace goes backward with a purpose It hath to climb The general's disdain'd By him one step below he by the next That next by him beneath so ever step Exampl'd by the first pace that is sick Of his superior grows to an envious fever Of pale and bloodless emulation And 'tis this fever that keeps Troy on foot Not her own sinews To end a tale of length Troy in our weakness stands not in her strengthMost wisely hath Ulysses here discover'd The fever whereof all our power is sickThe nature of the sickness found Ulysses What is the remedyThe great Achilles whom opinion crowns The sinew and the forehand of our host Having his ear full of his airy fame Grows dainty of his worth and in his tent Lies mocking our designs with him Patroclus Upon a lazy bed the livelong day Breaks scurril jests And with ridiculous and awkward action Which slanderer he imitation calls He pageants us Sometime great Agamemnon Thy topless deputation he puts on And like a strutting player whose conceit Lies in his hamstring and doth think it rich To hear the wooden dialogue and sound 'Twixt his stretch'd footing and the scaffoldage Such tobepitied and o'erwrested seeming He acts thy greatness in and when he speaks 'Tis like a chime amending with terms unsquar'd Which from the tongue of roaring Typhon dropp'd Would seem hyperboles At this fusty stuff The large Achilles on his press'd bed lolling From his deep chest laughs out a loud applause Cries 'Excellent 'tis Agamemnon just Now play me Nestor hem and stroke thy beard As he being drest to some oration' That's doneas near as the extremest ends Of parallels as like Vulcan and his wife Yet god Achilles still cries 'Excellent 'Tis Nestor right Now play him me Patroclus Arming to answer in a night alarm' And then forsooth the faint defects of age Must be the scene of mirth to cough and spit And with a palsyfumbling on his gorget Shake in and out the rivet And at this sport Sir Valour dies cries 'O enough Patroclus Or give me ribs of steel I shall split all In pleasure of my spleen' And in this fashion All our abilities gifts natures shapes Severals and generals of grace exact Achievements plots orders preventions Excitements to the field or speech for truce Success or loss what is or is not serves As stuff for these two to make paradoxesAnd in the imitation of these twain Who as Ulysses says opinion crowns With an imperial voicemany are infect Ajax is grown selfwill'd and bears his head In such a rein in full as proud a place As broad Achilles keeps his tent like him Makes factious feasts rails on our state of war Bold as an oracle and sets Thersites A slave whose gall coins slanders like a mint To match us in comparisons with dirt To weaken and discredit our exposure How rank soever rounded in with dangerThey tax our policy and call it cowardice Count wisdom as no member of the war Forestall prescience and esteem no act But that of hand The still and mental parts That do contrive how many hands shall strike When fitness calls them on and know by measure Of their observant toil the enemies' weight Why this hath not a finger's dignity They call this bedwork mapp'ry closetwar So that the ram that batters down the wall For the great swinge and rudeness of his poise They place before his hand that made the engine Or those that with the fineness of their souls By reason guide his executionLet this be granted and Achilles' horse Makes many Thetis' sons TucketWhat trumpet Look MenelausFrom TroyWhat would you fore our tentIs this great Agamemnon's tent I pray youEven thisMay one that is a herald and a prince Do a fair message to his kingly eyesWith surety stronger than Achilles' an Fore all the Greekish heads which with one voice Call Agamemnon head and generalFair leave and large security How may A stranger to those most imperial looks Know them from eyes of other mortalsHowAy I ask that I might waken reverence And bid the cheek be ready with a blush Modest as Morning when she coldly eyes The youthful Phoebus Which is that god in office guiding men Which is the high and mighty AgamemnonThis Troyan scorns us or the men of Troy Are ceremonious courtiersCourtiers as free as debonair unarm'd As bending angels that's their fame in peace But when they would seem soldiers they have galls Good arms strong joints true swords and Jove's accord Nothing so full of heart But peace Aeneas Peace Troyan lay thy finger on thy lips The worthiness of praise distains his worth If that the prais'd himself bring the praise forth But what the repining enemy commends That breath fame blows that praise sole pure transcendsSir you of Troy call you yourself AeneasAy Greek that is my nameWhat's your affair I pray youSir pardon 'tis for Agamemnon's earsHe hears nought privately that comes from TroyNor I from Troy come not to whisper with him I bring a trumpet to awake his ear To set his sense on the attentive bent And then to speakSpeak frankly as the wind It is not Agamemnon's sleeping hour That thou shalt know Troyan he is awake He tells thee so himselfTrumpet blow loud Send thy brass voice through all these lazy tents And every Greek of mettle let him know What Troy means fairly shall be spoke aloud Sound trumpet We have great Agamemnon here in Troy A prince called HectorPriam is his father Who in this dull and longcontinued truce Is resty grown he bade me take a trumpet And to this purpose speak Kings princes lords If there be one among the fair'st of Greece That holds his honour higher than his ease That seeks his praise more than he fears his peril That knows his valour and knows not his fear That loves his mistress more than in confession With truant vows to her own lips he loves And dare avow her beauty and her worth In other arms than hersto him this challenge Hector in view of Troyans and of Greeks Shall make it good or do his best to do it He hath a lady wiser fairer truer Than ever Greek did couple in his arms And will tomorrow with his trumpet call Midway between your tents and walls of Troy To rouse a Grecian that is true in love If any come Hector shall honour him If none he'll say in Troy when he retires The Grecian dames are sunburnt and not worth The splinter of a lance Even so muchThis shall be told our lovers Lord Aeneas If none of them have soul in such a kind We left them all at home But we are soldiers And may that soldier a mere recreant prove That means not hath not or is not in love If then one is or hath or means to be That one meets Hector if none else I am heTell him of Nestor one that was a man When Hector's grandsire suck'd He is old now But if there be not in our Grecian mould One noble man that hath one spark of fire To answer for his love tell him from me I'll hide my silver beard in a gold beaver And in my vantbrace put this wither'd brawn And meeting him will tell him that my lady Was fairer than his grandame and as chaste As may be in the world His youth in flood I'll prove this truth with my three drops of bloodNow heavens forfend such scarcity of youthAmenFair Lord Aeneas let me touch your hand To our pavilion shall I lead you first Achilles shall have word of this intent So shall each lord of Greece from tent to tent Yourself shall feast with us before you go And find the welcome of a noble foeall but and NestorWhat says UlyssesI have a young conception in my brain Be you my time to bring it to some shapeWhat is'tThis 'tis Blunt wedges rive hard knots The seeded pride That hath to this maturity blown up In rank Achilles must or now be cropp'd Or shedding breed a nursery of like evil To overbulk us allWell and howThis challenge that the gallant Hector sends However it is spread in general name Relates in purpose only to AchillesTrue The purpose is perspicuous even as substance Whose grossness little characters sum up And in the publication make no strain But that Achilles were his brain as barren As banks of Libyathough Apollo knows 'Tis dry enoughwill with great speed of judgment Ay with celerity find Hector's purpose Pointing on himAnd wake him to the answer think youWhy 'tis most meet Who may you else oppose That can from Hector bring those honours off If not Achilles Though 't be a sportful combat Yet in this trial much opinion dwells For here the Troyans taste our dear'st repute With their fin'st palate and trust to me Ulysses Our imputation shall be oddly pois'd In this vile action for the success Although particular shall give a scantling Of good or bad unto the general And in such indexes although small pricks To their subsequent volumes there is seen The baby figure of the giant mas Of things to come at large It is suppos'd He that meets Hector issues from our choice And choice being mutual act of all our souls Makes merit her election and doth boil As 'twere from forth us all a man distill'd Out of our virtues who miscarrying What heart receives from hence a conquering part To steel a strong opinion to themselves Which tain'd limbs are his instruments In no less working than are swords and bows Directive by the limbsGive pardon to my speech Therefore 'tis meet Achilles meet not Hector Let us like merchants show our foulest wares And think perchance they'll sell if not the lustre Of the better yet to show shall show the better By showing the worst first Do not consent That ever Hector and Achilles meet For both our honour and our shame in this Are dogg'd with two strange followersI see them not with my old eyes What are theyWhat glory our Achilles shares from Hector Were he not proud we all should wear with him But he already is too insolent And it were better parch in Afric sun Than in the pride and salt scorn of his eyes Should he scape Hector fair If he were foil'd Why then we do our main opinion crush In taint of our best man No make a lott'ry And by device let blockish Ajax draw The sort to fight with Hector Among ourselves Give him allowance for the better man For that will physic the great Myrmidon Who broils in loud applause and make him fall His crest that prouder than blue Iris bends If the dull brainless Ajax come safe off We'll dress him up in voices if he fail Yet go we under our opinion still That we have better men But hit or miss Our project's life this shape of sense assumes Ajax employ'd plucks down Achilles' plumesNow Ulysses I begin to relish thy advice And I will give a taste thereof forthwith To Agamemnon Go we to him straight Two curs shall tame each other pride alone Must tarre the mastiffs on as 'twere their bone
