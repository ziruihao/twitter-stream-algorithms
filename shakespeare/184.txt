Apemantus Aside aside here comes Lord Timon Re and Come with me fool comeI do not always follow lover elder brother and woman sometime the philosopher Pray you walk near I'll speak with you anon You make me marvel wherefore ere this time Had you not fully laid my state before me That I might so have rated my expense As I had leave of meansYou would not hear me At many leisures I propos'dGo to Perchance some single vantages you took When my indisposition put you back And that unaptness made your minister Thus to excuse yourselfO my good lord At many times I brought in my accounts Laid them before you you would throw them off And say you found them in mine honesty When for some trifling present you have bid me Return so much I have shook my head and wept Yea 'gainst th' authority of manners pray'd you To hold your hand more close I did endure Not seldom nor no slight checks when I have Prompted you in the ebb of your estate And your great flow of debts My lov'd lord Though you hear now too late yet now's a time The greatest of your having lacks a half To pay your present debtsLet all my land be sold'Tis all engag'd some forfeited and gone And what remains will hardly stop the mouth Of present dues The future comes apace What shall defend the interim And at length How goes our reck'ningTo Lacedaemon did my land extendO my good lord the world is but a word Were it all yours to give it in a breath How quickly were it goneYou tell me trueIf you suspect my husbandry or falsehood Call me before th' exactest auditors And set me on the proof So the gods bless me When all our offices have been oppress'd With riotous feeders when our vaults have wept With drunken spilth of wine when every room Hath blaz'd with lights and bray'd with minstrelsy I have retir'd me to a wasteful cock And set mine eyes at flowPrithee no more'Heavens' have I said 'the bounty of this lord How many prodigal bits have slaves and peasants This night englutted Who is not Lord Timon's What heart head sword force means but is Lord Timon's Great Timon noble worthy royal Timon' Ah when the means are gone that buy this praise The breath is gone whereof this praise is made Feastwon fastlost one cloud of winter show'rs These flies are couch'dCome sermon me no further No villainous bounty yet hath pass'd my heart Unwisely not ignobly have I given Why dost thou weep Canst thou the conscience lack To think I shall lack friends Secure thy heart If I would broach the vessels of my love And try the argument of hearts by borrowing Men and men's fortunes could I frankly use As I can bid thee speakAssurance bless your thoughtsAnd in some sort these wants of mine are crown'd That I account them blessings for by these Shall I try friends You shall perceive how you Mistake my fortunes I am wealthy in my friends Within there Flaminius Servilius and another My lord my lordI will dispatch you severally you to Lord Lucius to Lord Lucullus you I hunted with his honour today You to Sempronius Commend me to their loves and I am proud say that my occasions have found time to use 'em toward a supply of money Let the request be fifty talentsAs you have said my lord Aside Lord Lucius and Lucullus HumhGo you sir to the senators Of whom even to the state's best health I have Deserv'd this hearing Bid 'em send o' th' instant A thousand talents to meI have been bold For that I knew it the most general way To them to use your signet and your name But they do shake their heads and I am here No richer in returnIs't true Can't beThey answer in a joint and corporate voice That now they are at fall want treasure cannot Do what they would are sorry you are honourable But yet they could have wish'd they know not Something hath been amiss a noble nature May catch a wrench would all were well 'tis pity And so intending other serious matters After distasteful looks and these hard fractions With certain halfcaps and coldmoving nods They froze me into silenceYou gods reward them Prithee man look cheerly These old fellows Have their ingratitude in them hereditary Their blood is cak'd 'tis cold it seldom flows 'Tis lack of kindly warmth they are not kind And nature as it grows again toward earth Is fashion'd for the journey dull and heavy Go to Ventidius Prithee be not sad Thou art true and honest ingeniously I speak No blame belongs to thee Ventidius lately Buried his father by whose death he's stepp'd Into a great estate When he was poor Imprison'd and in scarcity of friends I clear'd him with five talents Greet him from me Bid him suppose some good necessity Touches his friend which craves to be rememb'red With those five talents That had give't these fellows To whom 'tis instant due Nev'r speak or think That Timon's fortunes 'mong his friends can sinkI would I could not think it That thought is bounty's foe Being free itself it thinks all others so
