 SceneMantua A streetRomeo Rom If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep My dreams presage some joyful news at hand My bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne And all this day an unaccustom'd spirit Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts I dreamt my lady came and found me dead Strange dream that gives a dead man leave to think And breath'd such life with kisses in my lips That I reviv'd and was an emperor Ah me how sweet is love itself possess'd When but love's shadows are so rich in joyRomeo's Man Balthasar booted News from Verona How now Balthasar Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar How doth my lady Is my father well How fares my Juliet That I ask again For nothing can be ill if she be well Man Then she is well and nothing can be ill Her body sleeps in Capel's monument And her immortal part with angels lives I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault And presently took post to tell it you O pardon me for bringing these ill news Since you did leave it for my office sir Rom Is it e'en so Then I defy you stars Thou knowest my lodging Get me ink and paper And hire posthorses I will hence tonight Man I do beseech you sir have patience Your looks are pale and wild and do import Some misadventure Rom Tush thou art deceiv'd Leave me and do the thing I bid thee do Hast thou no letters to me from the friar Man No my good lord Rom No matter Get thee gone And hire those horses I'll be with thee straight Balthasar Well Juliet I will lie with thee tonight Let's see for means O mischief thou art swift Toin the thoughts of desperate men I do remember an apothecary And hereabouts 'a dwells which late I noted In tatt'red weeds with overwhelming brows Culling of simples Meagre were his looks Sharp misery had worn him to the bones And in his needy shop a tortoise hung An alligator stuff'd and other skins Of illshaped fishes and about his shelves A beggarly account of empty boxes Green earthen pots bladders and musty seeds Remnants of packthread and old cakes of roses Were thinly scattered to make up a show Noting this penury to myself I said 'An if a man did need a poison now Whose sale is present death in Mantua Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him' O this same thought did but forerun my need And this same needy man must sell it me As I remember this should be the house Being holiday the beggar's shop is shut What ho apothecaryApothecary Apoth Who calls so loud Rom Come hither man I see that thou art poor Hold there is forty ducats Let me have A dram of poison such soonspeeding gear As will disperse itself through all the veins That the lifeweary taker mall fall dead And that the trunk may be discharg'd of breath As violently as hasty powder fir'd Doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb Apoth Such mortal drugs I have but Mantua's law Is death to any he that utters them Rom Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness And fearest to die Famine is in thy cheeks Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back The world is not thy friend nor the world's law The world affords no law to make thee rich Then be not poor but break it and take this Apoth My poverty but not my will consents Rom I pay thy poverty and not thy will Apoth Put this in any liquid thing you will And drink it off and if you had the strength Of twenty men it would dispatch you straight Rom There is thy gold worse poison to men's souls Doing more murther in this loathsome world Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell I sell thee poison thou hast sold me none Farewell Buy food and get thyself in flesh Come cordial and not poison go with me To Juliet's grave for there must I use theeSceneVerona Friar Laurence's cellFriar John to Friar Laurence John Holy Franciscan friar brother hoFriar Laurence Laur This same should be the voice of Friar John Welcome from Mantua What says Romeo Or if his mind be writ give me his letter John Going to find a barefoot brother out One of our order to associate me Here in this city visiting the sick And finding him the searchers of the town Suspecting that we both were in a house Where the infectious pestilence did reign Seal'd up the doors and would not let us forth So that my speed to Mantua there was stay'd Laur Who bare my letter then to Romeo John I could not send it here it is again Nor get a messenger to bring it thee So fearful were they of infection Laur Unhappy fortune By my brotherhood The letter was not nice but full of charge Of dear import and the neglecting it May do much danger Friar John go hence Get me an iron crow and bring it straight Unto my cell John Brother I'll go and bring it theeLaur Now must I to the monument alone Within this three hours will fair Juliet wake She will beshrew me much that Romeo Hath had no notice of these accidents But I will write again to Mantua And keep her at my cell till Romeo come Poor living corse clos'd in a dead man's tombSceneVerona A churchyard in it the monument of the CapuletsParis and his Page with flowers and a torch Par Give me thy torch boy Hence and stand aloof Yet put it out for I would not be seen Under yond yew tree lay thee all along

hear'st something approach Give me those flowers Do as I bid thee go Page aside I am almost afraid to stand alone Here in the churchyard yet I will adventure Retires Par Sweet flower with flowers thy bridal bed I strew O woe thy canopy is dust and stones Which with sweet water nightly I will dew Or wanting that with tears distill'd by moans The obsequies that I for thee will keep Nightly shall be

lord and father Give me the light Upon thy life I charge thee Whate'er thou hearest or seest stand all aloof And do not interrupt me in my course Why I descend into this bed of death Is partly to behold my lady's face But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger A precious ring a ring that I must use In dear employment Therefore hence be gone But if thou jealous dost return to pry In what I farther shall intend to do By heaven I will tear thee joint by joint And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs The time and my intents are savagewild More fierce and more inexorable far Than empty tigers or the roaring sea Bal I will be gone sir and not trouble you Rom So shalt thou show me friendship Take thou that Live and be prosperous and farewell good fellow Bal aside For all this same I'll hide me hereabout His looks I fear and his intents I doubtRetires Rom Thou detestable maw thou womb of death Gorg'd with the dearest morsel of the earth Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to

me thy hand One writ with me in sour misfortune's book I'll bury thee in a triumphant grave A grave O no a lanthorn slaught'red youth For here lies Juliet and her beauty makes This vault a feasting presence full of light Death lie thou there by a dead man interr'dLays him in the tomb How oft when men are at the point of death Have they been merry which their keepers call A lightning before death O how may I Call this a lightning O my love my wife Death that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty Thou art not conquer'd Beauty's ensign yet Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks And death's pale flag is not advanced there Tybalt liest thou there in thy bloody sheet O what more favour can I do to thee Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain To sunder his that was thine enemy Forgive me cousin' Ah dear Juliet Why art thou yet so fair Shall I believe That unsubstantial Death is amorous And that the lean abhorred monster keeps Thee here in dark to be his paramour For fear of that I still will stay with thee And never from this palace of dim night Depart again Here here will I remain With worms that are thy chambermaids O here Will I set up my everlasting rest And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars From this worldwearied flesh Eyes look your last Arms take your last embrace and lips O you The doors of breath seal with a righteous

I dare not sir My master knows not but I am gone hence And fearfully did menace me with death If I did stay to look on his intents Friar Stay then I'll go alone Fear comes upon me O much I fear some ill unthrifty thing Bal As I did sleep under this yew tree here I dreamt my master and another fought And that my master slew him Friar Romeo Alack alack what blood is this which stains The stony entrance of this sepulchre What mean these masterless and gory swords To lie discolour'd by this place of peace s the tomb Romeo O pale Who else What Paris too And steep'd in blood Ah what an unkind hour Is guilty of this lamentable chance The lady stirsJuliet rises Jul O comfortable friar where is my lord I do remember well where I should be And there I am Where is my Romeo Friar I hear some

there rest and let me die She stabs herself and falls on Romeo's bodyParis's Boy and Watch Boy This is the place There where the torch doth burn Chief Watch 'the ground is bloody Search about the churchyard Go some of you whoe'er you find attach some of the Watch Pitiful sight here lies the County slain And Juliet bleeding warm and newly dead Who here hath lain this two days buried Go tell the Prince run to the Capulets Raise up the Montagues some others search others of the Watch We see the ground whereon these woes do lie But the true ground of all these piteous woes We cannot without circumstance descry some of the Watch with Romeo's Man BalthasarWatch Here's Romeo's man We found him in the churchyard Chief Watch Hold him in safety till the Prince come hitherFriar Laurence and another WatchmanWatch Here is a friar that trembles sighs and weeps We took this mattock and this spade from him As he was coming from this churchyard side Chief Watch A great suspicion Stay the friar toothe Prince and Attendants Prince What misadventure is so early up That calls our person from our morning restCapulet and his Wife with others Cap What should it be that they so shriek abroad Wife The people in the street cry 'Romeo' Some 'Juliet' and some 'Paris' and all run With open outcry toward our monument Prince What fear is this which startles in our ears Chief Watch Sovereign here lies the County Paris slain And Romeo dead and Juliet dead before Warm and new kill'd Prince Search seek and know how this foul murder comes Chief Watch Here is a friar and slaughter'd Romeo's man With instruments upon them fit to open These dead men's tombs Cap O heavens O wife look how our daughter bleeds This dagger hath mista'en for lo his house Is empty on the back of Montague And it missheathed in my daughter's bosom Wife O me this sight of death is as a bell That warns my old age to a sepulchre Montague and others Prince Come Montague for thou art early up To see thy son and heir more early down Mon Alas my liege my wife is dead tonight Grief of my son's exile hath stopp'd her breath What further woe conspires against mine age Prince Look and thou shalt see Mon O thou untaught what manners is in this To press before thy father to a grave Prince Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while Till we can clear these ambiguities And know their spring their head their true descent And then will I be general of your woes And lead you even to death Meantime forbear And let mischance be slave to patience Bring forth the parties of suspicion Friar I am the greatest able to do least Yet most suspected as the time and place Doth make against me of this direful murther And here I stand both to impeach and purge Myself condemned and myself excus'd Prince Then say it once what thou dost know in this Friar I will be brief for my short date of breath Is not so long as is a tedious tale Romeo there dead was husband to that Juliet And she there dead that Romeo's faithful wife I married them and their stol'n marriage day Was Tybalt's doomsday whose untimely death Banish'd the newmade bridegroom from this city For whom and not for Tybalt Juliet pin'd You to remove that siege of grief from her Betroth'd and would have married her perforce To County Paris Then comes she to me And with wild looks bid me devise some mean To rid her from this second marriage Or in my cell there would she kill herself Then gave I her so tutored by my art A sleeping potion which so took effect As I intended for it wrought on her The form of death Meantime I writ to Romeo That he should hither come as this dire night To help to take her from her borrowed grave Being the time the potion's force should cease But he which bore my letter Friar John Was stay'd by accident and yesternight Return'd my letter back Then all alone At the prefixed hour of her waking Came I to take her from her kindred's vault Meaning to keep her closely at my cell Till I conveniently could send to Romeo But when I came some minute ere the time Of her awaking here untimely lay The noble Paris and true Romeo dead She wakes and I entreated her come forth And bear this work of heaven with patience But then a noise did scare me from the tomb And she too desperate would not go with me But as it seems did violence on herself All this I know and to the marriage Her nurse is privy and if aught in this Miscarried by my fault let my old life Be sacrific'd some hour before his time Unto the rigour of severest law Prince We still have known thee for a holy man Where's Romeo's man What can he say in this Bal I brought my master news of Juliet's death And then in post he came from Mantua To this same place to this same monument This letter he early bid me give his father And threat'ned me with death going in the vault If I departed not and left him there Prince Give me the letter I will look on it Where is the County's page that rais'd the watch Sirrah what made your master in this place Boy He came with flowers to strew his lady's grave And bid me stand aloof and so I did Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb And byandby my master drew on him And then I ran away to call the watch Prince This letter doth make good the friar's words Their course of love the tidings of her death And here he writes that he did buy a poison Of a poor pothecary and therewithal Came to this vault to die and lie with Juliet Where be these enemies Capulet Montage See what a scourge is laid upon your hate That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love And I for winking at you discords too Have lost a brace of kinsmen All are punish'd Cap O brother Montague give me thy hand This is my daughter's jointure for no more Can I demand Mon But I can give thee more For I will raise her Statue in pure gold That whiles Verona by that name is known There shall no figure at such rate be set As that of true and faithful Juliet Cap As rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie Poor sacrifices of our enmity Prince A glooming peace this morning with it brings The sun for sorrow will not show his head Go hence to have more talk of these sad things Some shall be pardon'd and some punished For never was a story of more woe Than this of Juliet and her Romeo omnes
