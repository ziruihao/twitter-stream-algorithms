Westminster Hallas to the Parliament the the and others and Call forth Bagot Now Bagot freely speak thy mind What thou dost know of noble Gloucester's death Who wrought it with the King and who perform'd The bloody office of his timeless endThen set before my face the Lord AumerleCousin stand forth and look upon that manMy Lord Aumerle I know your daring tongue Scorns to unsay what once it hath deliver'd In that dead time when Gloucester's death was plotted I heard you say 'Is not my arm of length That reacheth from the restful English Court As far as Calais to mine uncle's head' Amongst much other talk that very time I heard you say that you had rather refuse The offer of an hundred thousand crowns Than Bolingbroke's return to England Adding withal how blest this land would be In this your cousin's deathPrinces and noble lords What answer shall I make to this base man Shall I so much dishonour my fair stars On equal terms to give him chastisement Either I must or have mine honour soil'd With the attainder of his slanderous lips There is my gage the manual seal of death That marks thee out for hell I say thou liest And will maintain what thou hast said is false In thy heartblood through being all too base To stain the temper of my knightly swordBagot forbear thou shalt not take it upExcepting one I would he were the best In all this presence that hath mov'd me soIf that thy valour stand on sympathy There is my gage Aumerle in gage to thine By that fair sun which shows me where thou stand'st I heard thee say and vauntingly thou spak'st it That thou wert cause of noble Gloucester's death If thou deniest it twenty times thou liest And I will turn thy falsehood to thy heart Where it was forged with my rapier's pointThou dar'st not coward live to see that dayNow by my soul I would it were this hourFitzwater thou art damn'd to hell for thisAumerle thou liest his honour is as true In this appeal as thou art an unjust And that thou art so there I throw my gage To prove it on thee to the extremest point Of mortal breathing Seize it if thou dar'stAn if I do not may my hands rot of And never brandish more revengeful steel Over the glittering helmet of my foeI task the earth to the like forsworn Aumerle And spur thee on with fun as many lies As may be halloa'd in thy treacherous ear From sun to sun There is my honour's pawn Engage it to the trial if thou darestWho sets me else By heaven I'll throw at all I have a thousand spirits in one breast To answer twenty thousand such as youMy Lord Fitzwater I do remember well The very time Aumerle and you did talk'Tis very true you were in presence then And you can witness with me this is trueAs false by heaven as heaven itself is trueSurrey thou liestDishonourable boy That lie shall lie so heavy on my sword That it shall render vengeance and revenge Till thou the liegiver and that lie do he In earth as quiet as thy father's skull In proof whereof there is my honour's pawn Engage it to the trial if thou dar'stHow fondly dost thou spur a forward horse If I dare eat or drink or breathe or live I dare meet Surrey in a wilderness And spit upon him whilst I say he lies And lies and lies There is my bond of faith To tie thee to my strong correction As I intend to thrive in this new world Aumerle is guilty of my true appeal Besides I heard the banish'd Norfolk say That thou Aumerle didst send two of thy men To execute the noble Duke at CalaisSome honest Christian trust me with a gage That Norfolk lies Here do I throw down this If he may be repeal'd to try his honourThese differences shall all rest under gage Till Norfolk be repeal'drepeal'd he shall be And though mine enemy restor'd again To all his lands and signories When he is return'd Against Aumerle we will enforce his trialThat honourable day shall never be seen Many a time hath banish'd Norfolk fought For Jesu Christ in glorious Christian field Streaming the ensign of the Christian cross Against black pagans Turks and Saracens And toil'd with works of war retir'd himself To Italy and there at Venice gave His body to that pleasant country's earth And his pure soul unto his captain Christ Under whose colours he had fought so longWhy Bishop is Norfolk deadAs surely as I live my lordSweet peace conduct his sweet soul to the bosom Of good old Abraham Lords appellants Your differences shall all rest under gage Till we assign you to your days of trialattendedGreat Duke of Lancaster I come to the From plumepluck'd Richard who with willing soul Adopts thee heir and his high sceptre yields To the possession of thy royal hand Ascend his throne descending now from him And long live Henry fourth of that nameIn God's name I'll ascend the regal throneMarry God forbid Worst in this royal presence may I speak Yet best beseeming me to speak the truth Would God that any in this noble presence Were enough noble to be upright judge Of noble Richard Then true noblesse would Learn him forbearance from so foul a wrong What subject can give sentence on his king And who sits here that is not Richard's subject Thieves are not judg'd but they are by to hear Although apparent guilt be seen in them And shall the figure of God's majesty His captain steward deputy elect Anointed crowned planted many years Be judg'd by subject and inferior breath And he himself not present O forfend it God That in a Christian climate souls refin'd Should show so heinous black obscene a deed I speak to subjects and a subject speaks Stirr'd up by God thus boldly for his king My Lord of Hereford here whom you call king Is a foul traitor to proud Hereford's king And if you crown him let me prophesy The blood of English shall manure the ground And future ages groan for this foul act Peace shall go sleep with Turks and infidels And in this seat of peace tumultuous wars Shall kin with kin and kind with kind confound Disorder horror fear and mutiny Shall here inhabit and this land be call'd The field of Golgotha and dead men's skulls O if you raise this house against this house It will the woefullest division prove That ever fell upon this cursed earth Prevent it resist it let it not be so Lest child child's children cry against you woeWell have you argued sir and for your pains Of capital treason we arrest you here My Lord of Westminster be it your charge To keep him safely till his day of trial May it please you lords to grant the commons' suitFetch hither Richard that in common view He may surrender so we shall proceed Without suspicionI will be his conductLords you that here are under our arrest Procure your sureties for your days of answer Little are we beholding to your love And little look'd for at your helping hands Rewithandbearing the regaliaAlack why am I sent for to a king Before I have shook off the regal thoughts Wherewith I reign'd I hardly yet have learn'd To insinuate flatter bow and bend my knee Give sorrow leave awhile to tutor me To this submission Yet I well remember The favours of these men Were they not mine Did they not sometime cry 'All hail' to me So Judas did to Christ but he in twelve Found truth in all but one I in twelve thousand none God save the King Will no man say amen Am I both priest and clerk Well then amen God save the King although I be not he And yet amen if heaven do think him me To do what service am I sent for hitherTo do that office of thine own good will Which tired majesty did make thee offer The resignation of thy state and crown To Henry BolingbrokeGive me the crown Here cousin seize the crown Here cousin On this side my hand and on that side thine Now is this golden crown like a deep well That owes two buckets filling one another The emptier ever dancing in the air The other down unseen and full of water That bucket down and fun of tears am I Drinking my griefs whilst you mount up on highI thought you had been willing to resignMy crown I am but still my griefs are mine You may my glories and my state depose But not my griefs still am I king of thosePart of your cares you give me with your crownYour cares set up do not pluck my cares down My care is loss of care by old care done Your care is gain of care by new care won The cares I give I have though given away They tend the crown yet still with me they stayAre you contented to resign the crownAy no no ay for I must nothing be Therefore no no for I resign to thee Now mark me how I will undo myself I give this heavy weight from off my head And this unwieldy sceptre from my hand The pride of kingly sway from out my heart With mine own tears I wash away my balm With mine own hands I give away my crown With mine own tongue deny my sacred state With mine own breath release all duteous oaths All pomp and majesty I do forswear My manors rents revenues I forgo My acts decrees and statutes I deny God pardon all oaths that are broke to me God keep all vows unbroke are made to thee Make me that nothing have with nothing griev'd And thou with all pleas'd that hast an achiev'd Long mayst thou live in Richard's seat to sit And soon lie Richard in an earthly pit God save King Henry unking'd Richard says And send him many years of sunshine days What more remainsNo more but that you read These accusations and these grievous crimes Committed by your person and your followers Against the state and profit of this land That by confessing them the souls of men May deem that you are worthily depos'dMust I do so And must I ravel out My weav'dup follies Gentle Northumberland If thy offences were upon record Would it not shame thee in so fair a troop To read a lecture of them If thou wouldst There shouldst thou find one heinous article Containing the deposing of a king And cracking the strong warrant of an oath Mark'd with a blot damn'd in the book of heaven Nay all of you that stand and look upon me Whilst that my wretchedness doth bait myself Though some of you with Pilate wash your hands Showing an outward pityyet you Pilates Have here deliver'd me to my sour cross And water cannot wash away your sinMy lord dispatch read o'er these articlesMine eyes are full of tears I cannot see And yet salt water blinds them not so much But they can see a sort of traitors here Nay if I turn mine eyes upon myself I find myself a traitor with the rest For I have given here my soul's consent T'undeck the pompous body of a king Made glory base and sovereignty a slave Proud majesty a subject state a peasantMy lordNo lord of thine thou haught insulting man Nor no man's lord I have no name no tide No not that name was given me at the font But 'tis usurp'd Alack the heavy day That I have worn so many winters out And know not now what name to call myself O that I were a mockery king of snow Standing before the sun of Bolingbroke To melt myself away in water drops Good king great king and yet not greatly good An if my word be sterling yet in England Let it command a mirror hither straight That it may show me what a face I have Since it is bankrupt of his majestyGo some of you and fetch a lookingglass an attendantRead o'er this paper while the glass doth comeFiend thou torments me ere I come to hellUrge it no more my Lord NorthumberlandThe Commons will not then be satisfiedThey shall be satisfied I'll read enough When I do see the very book indeed Where all my sins are writ and that's myself Re attendant with glass Give me that glass and therein will I read No deeper wrinkles yet Hath sorrow struck So many blows upon this face of mine And made no deeper wounds O flatt'ring glass Like to my followers in prosperity Thou dost beguile me Was this face the face That every day under his household roof Did keep ten thousand men Was this the face That like the sun did make beholders wink Is this the face which fac'd so many follies That was at last outfac'd by Bolingbroke A brittle glory shineth in this face As brittle as the glory is the face Dashes the glass against the ground For there it is crack'd in a hundred shivers Mark silent king the moral of this sport How soon my sorrow hath destroy'd my faceThe shadow of your sorrow hath destroy'd The shadow of your faceSay that again The shadow of my sorrow Ha let's see 'Tis very true my grief lies all within And these external manner of laments Are merely shadows to the unseen grief That swells with silence in the tortur'd soul There lies the substance and I thank thee king For thy great bounty that not only giv'st Me cause to wail but teachest me the way How to lament the cause I'll beg one boon And then be gone and trouble you no more Shall I obtain itName it fair cousinFair cousin I am greater than a king For when I was a king my flatterers Were then but subjects being now a subject I have a king here to my flatterer Being so great I have no need to begYet askAnd shall I haveYou shallThen give me leave to goWhitherWhither you will so I were from your sightsGo some of you convey him to the TowerO good Convey Conveyers are you all That rise thus nimbly by a true king's fallsome Lords and a GuardOn Wednesday next we solemnly set down Our coronation Lords prepare yourselvesall but the theand A woeful pageant have we here beheldThe woe's to come the children yet unborn Shall feel this day as sharp to them as thornYou holy clergymen is there no plot To rid the realm of this pernicious blotMy lord Before I freely speak my mind herein You shall not only take the sacrament To bury mine intents but also to effect Whatever I shall happen to devise I see your brows are full of discontent Your hearts of sorrow and your eyes of tears Come home with me to supper I will lay A plot shall show us all a merry day
