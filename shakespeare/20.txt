Before the house of andGood Signior Angelo you must excuse us all My wife is shrewish when I keep not hours Say that I linger'd with you at your shop To see the making of her carcanet And that tomorrow you will bring it home But here's a villain that would face me down He met me on the mart and that I beat him And charg'd him with a thousand marks in gold And that I did deny my wife and house Thou drunkard thou what didst thou mean by this Say what you will sir but I know what I know That you beat me at the mart I have your hand to show If the skin were parchment and the blows you gave were ink Your own handwriting would tell you what I think I think thou art an ass Marry so it doth appear By the wrongs I suffer and the blows I bear I should kick being kick'd and being at that pass You would keep from my heels and beware of an ass Y'are sad Signior Balthazar pray God our cheer May answer my good will and your good welcome hereI hold your dainties cheap sir and your welcome dear O Signior Balthazar either at flesh or fish A table full of welcome makes scarce one dainty dishGood meat sir is common that every churl affords And welcome more common for that's nothing but

virtue years and modesty Plead on her part some cause to you unknown And doubt not sir but she will well excuse Why at this time the doors are made against you Be rul'd by me depart in patience And let us to the Tiger all to dinner And about evening come yourself alone To know the reason of this strange restraint If by strong hand you offer to break in Now in the stirring passage of the day A vulgar comment will be made of it And that supposed by the common rout Against your yet ungalled estimation That may with foul intrusionin And dwell upon your grave when you are dead For slander lives upon succession For ever hous'd where it gets possession You have prevail'd I will depart in quiet And in despite of mirth mean to be merry I know a wench of excellent discourse Pretty and witty wild

doors refuse to tain me I'll knock elsewhere to see if they'll disdain meI'll meet you at that place some hour hence Do so this jest shall cost me some expense Before the house ofwithAnd may it be that you have quite forgot A husband's office Shall Antipholus Even in the spring of love thy lovesprings rot Shall love in building grow so ruinous If you did wed my sister for her wealth Then for her wealth's sake use her with more kindness Or if you like elsewhere do it by stealth Muffle your false love with some show of blindness Let not my sister read it in your eye Be not thy tongue thy own shame's orator Look sweet speak fair become disloyalty Apparel vice like virtue's harbinger Bear a fair presence though your heart be tainted Teach sin the carriage of a holy saint Be secretfalse What need she be acquainted What simple thief brags of his own attaint 'Tis double wrong to truant with your bed And let her read it in thy looks at board Shame hath a bastard fame well managed Ill deeds is doubled with an evil word Alas poor women make us but believe Being compact of credit that you love us Though others have the arm show us the sleeve We in your motion turn and you may move us Then gentle brother get you in again Comfort my sister cheer her call her wife 'Tis holy sport to be a little vain When the sweet breath of flattery conquers strife Sweet mistresswhat your name is else I know not Nor by what wonder you do hit of mine Less in your knowledge and your grace you show not Than our earth's wondermore than earth divine Teach me dear creature how to think and speak Lay open to my earthygross conceit Smoth'red in errors feeble shallow weak The folded meaning of your words' deceit Against my soul's pure truth why labour you To make it wander in an unknown field Are you a god Would you create me new Transform me then and to your pow'r I'll yield But if that I am I then well I know Your weeping sister is no wife of mine Nor to her bed no homage do I owe Far more far more to you do I decline O train me not sweet mermaid with thy note To drown me in thy sister's flood of tears Sing siren for thyself and I will dote Spread o'er the silver waves thy golden hairs And as a bed I'll take them and there he And in that glorious supposition think He gains by death that hath such means to die Let Love being light be drowned if she sinkWhat are you mad that you do reason so Not mad but mated how I do not knowIt is a fault that springeth from your eye For gazing on your beams fair sun being byGaze where you should and that will clear your sight As good to wink sweet love as look on nightWhy call you me love Call my sister so Thy sister's sisterThat's my sister No It is thyself mine own self's better part Mine eye's clear eye my dear heart's dearer heart My food my fortune and my sweet hope's aim My sole earth's heaven and my heaven's claimAll this my sister is or else should be Call thyself sister sweet for I am thee Thee will I love and with thee lead my life Thou hast no husband yet nor I no wife Give me thy handO soft sir hold you still I'll fetch my sister to get her good willWhy how now Dromio Where run'st thou so fast Do you know me sir Am I Dromio Am I your man Am I myself Thou art Dromio thou art my man thou art thyself I am an ass I am a woman's man and besides myself What woman's man and how besides thyself Marry sir besides myself I am due to a womanone that claims me one that haunts me one that will have me What claim lays she to thee Marry sir such claim as you would lay to your horse and she would have me as a beast not that I being a beast she would have me but that she being a very beastly creature lays claim to me What is she A very reverent body ay such a one as a man may not speak of without he say irreverence' I have but lean luck in the match and yet is she a wondrous fat marriage How dost thou mean a fat marriage Marry sir she's the kitchenwench and all grease and I know not what use to put her to but to make a lamp of her and run from her by her own light I warrant her rags and the tallow in them will burn Poland winter If she lives till doomsday she'll burn week longer than the whole world What complexion is she of Swart like my shoe but her face nothing like so clean kept for why she sweats a man may go over shoes in the grime of it That's a fault that water will mend No sir 'tis in grain Noah's flood could not do it What's her name Nell sir but her name and three quarters that's an ell and three quarters will not measure her from hip to hip Then she bears some breadth No longer from head to foot than from hip to hip she is spherical like a globe I could find out countries in her In what part of her body stands Ireland Marry sir in her buttocks I found it out by the bogs Where Scotland I found it by the barrenness hard in the palm of the hand Where France In her forehead arm'd and reverted making war against her heir Where England I look'd for the chalky cliffs but I could find no whiteness in them but I guess it stood in her chin by the salt rheum that ran between France and it Where Spain Faith I saw it not but I felt it hot in her breath Where America the Indies O sir upon her nose an o'er embellished with rubies carbuncles sapphires declining their rich aspect to the hot breath of Spain who sent whole armadoes of caracks to be ballast at her nose Where stood Belgia the Netherlands O Sir I did not look so low To conclude this drudge or diviner laid claim to me call'd me Dromio swore I was assur'd to her told me what privy marks I had about me as the mark of my shoulder the mole in my neck the great wart on my left arm that I amaz'd ran from her as a witch And I think if my breast had not been made of faith and my heart of steel She had transform'd me to a curtal dog and made me turn i' th' wheel Go hie thee presently post to the road An if the wind blow any way from shore I will not harbour in this town tonight If any bark put forth come to the mart Where I will walk till thou return to me If every one knows us and we know none 'Tis time I think to trudge pack and be gone As from a bear a man would run for life So fly I from her that would be my wifeThere's none but witches do inhabit here And therefore 'tis high time that I were hence She that doth call me husband even my soul Doth for a wife abhor But her fair sister Possess'd with such a gentle sovereign grace Of such enchanting presence and discourse Hath almost made me traitor to myself But lest myself be guilty to selfwrong I'll stop mine ears against the mermaid's songwith the chainMaster Antipholus Ay that's my nameI know it well sir Lo here is the chain I thought to have ta'en you at the Porpentine The chain unfinish'd made me stay thus long What is your will that I shall do with thisWhat please yourself sir I have made it for you Made it for me sir I bespoke it notNot once nor twice but twenty times you have Go home with it and please your wife withal And soon at suppertime I'll visit you And then receive my money for the chain I pray you sir receive the money now For fear you ne'er see chain nor money moreYou are a merry man sir fare you wellWhat I should think of this cannot tell But this I think there's no man is so vain That would refuse so fair an offer'd chain I see a man here needs not live by shifts When in the streets he meets such golden gifts I'll to the mart and there for Dromio stay If any ship put out then straight away
