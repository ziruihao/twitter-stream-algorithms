say with her that she loves me consent with both that we may enjoy each other It shall be to your good for my father's house and all the revenue that was old Sir Rowland's will I estate upon you and

RosalindGod save you brotherAnd you fair sister O my dear Orlando how it grieves me to see thee wear thy heart in a scarfIt is my armI thought thy heart had been wounded with the claws of a lionWounded it is but with the eyes of a ladyDid your brother tell you how I counterfeited to swoon when he show'd me your handkercherAy and greater wonders than thatO I know where you are Nay 'tis true There was never any thing so sudden but the fight of two rams and Caesar's thrasonical brag of 'I came saw and overcame' For your brother and my sister no sooner met but they look'd no sooner look'd but they lov'd no sooner lov'd but they sigh'd no sooner sigh'd but they ask'd one another the reason no sooner knew the reason but they sought the remedy and in these degrees have they made pair of stairs to marriage which they will climb incontinent or else be incontinent before marriage They are in the very wrath of love and they will together Clubs cannot part themThey shall be married tomorrow and I will bid the Duke to the nuptial But O how bitter a thing it is to look into happiness through another man's eyes By so much the more shall I tomorrow be at the height of heartheaviness by how much I shall think my brother happy in having what he wishes forWhy then tomorrow I cannot serve your turn for RosalindI can live no longer by thinkingI will weary you then no longer with idle talking Know of me then for now I speak to some purpose that I know you are a gentleman of good conceit I speak not this that you should bear a good opinion of my knowledge insomuch I say I know you are neither do I labour for a greater esteem than may in some little measure draw a belief from you to do yourself good and not to grace me Believe then if you please that I can do strange things I have since I was three year old convers'd with a magician most profound in his art and yet not damnable If you do love Rosalind so near the heart as your gesture cries it out when your brother marries Aliena shall you marry her I know into what straits of fortune she is driven and it is not impossible to me if it appear not inconvenient to you to set her before your eyes tomorrow human as she is and without any dangerSpeak'st thou in sober meaningsBy my life I do which I tender dearly though I say I am a magician Therefore put you in your best array bid your friends for if you will be married tomorrow you shall and to Rosalind if you will andLook here comes a lover of mine and a lover of hersYouth you have done me much ungentleness To show the letter that I writ to youI care not if I have It is my study To seem despiteful and ungentle to you You are there follow'd by a faithful shepherd Look upon him love him he worships youGood shepherd tell this youth what 'tis to loveIt is to be all made of sighs and tears And so am I for PhebeAnd I for GanymedeAnd I for RosalindAnd I for no womanIt is to be all made of faith and service And so am I for PhebeAnd I for

sing hey ding a ding ding Sweet lovers love the spring Between the acres of the rye With a hey and a ho and a hey nonino These pretty country folks would lie In the spring time &c This carol they began that hour With a hey and a ho and a hey nonino How that a life was but a flower In the spring time &c And therefore take the present time With a hey and a ho and a hey nonino For love is crowned

judgment This is call'd the Reply Churlish If again it was not well cut he would answer I spake not true This is call'd the Reproof Valiant If again it was not well cut he would say I lie This is call'd the Countercheck Quarrelsome And so to the Lie Circumstantial and the Lie DirectAnd how oft did you say his beard was not well cutI durst go no further than the Lie Circumstantial nor he durst

welcome thou art to me Even daughter welcome in no less degreeI will not eat my word now thou art mine Thy faith my fancy to thee doth combine dedeLet me have audience for a word or two I am the second son of old Sir Rowland That bring these tidings to this fair assembly Duke Frederick hearing how that every day Men of great worth resorted to this forest Address'd a mighty power which were on foot In his own conduct purposely to take His brother here and put him to the sword And to the skirts of this wild wood he came Where meeting with an old religious man After some question with him was converted Both from his prise and from the world His crown bequeathing to his banish'd brother And all their lands restor'd to them again That were with him exil'd This to be true I do engage my lifeWelcome young man Thou offer'st fairly to thy brothers' wedding To one his lands withheld and to the other A land itself at large a potent dukedom First in this forest let us do those ends That here were well begun and well begot And after every of this happy number That have endur'd shrewd days and nights with us Shall share the good of our returned fortune According to the measure of their states Meantime forget this newfall'n dignity And fall into our rustic revelry Play music and you brides and bridegrooms all With measure heap'd in joy to th' measures fallSir by your patience If I heard you rightly The Duke hath put on a religious life And thrown into neglect the pompous court He hathTo him willOut of these convertites There is much matter to be heard and learn'd ToYou to your former honour I bequeath Your patience and your virtue well deserves it ToYou to a love that your true faith doth merit ToYou to your land and love and great allies ToYou to a long and welldeserved bed ToAnd you to wrangling for thy loving voyage Is but for two months victuall'd So to your pleasures I am for other than for dancing measuresStay Jaques stayTo see no pastimeWhat you would have I'll stay to know at your abandon'd cave Proceed proceed We will begin these rites As we do trust they'll end in true delightsA dance It is not the fashion to see the lady the epilogue but it is no more unhandsome than to see the lord the prologue If it be true that good wine needs no bush 'tis true that a good play needs no epilogue Yet to good wine they do use good bushes and good plays prove the better by the help of good epilogues What a case am I in then that am neither a good epilogue nor cannot insinuate with you in the behalf of a good play I am not furnish'd like a beggar therefore to beg will not become me My way is to conjure you and I'll begin with the women I charge you O women for the love you bear to men to like as much of this play as please you and I charge you O men for the love you bear to women as I perceive by your simp'ring none of you hates them that between you and the women the play may please If I were a woman I would kiss as many of you as had beards that pleas'd me complexions that lik'd me and breaths that I defied not and I am sure as many as have good beards or good faces or sweet breaths will for my kind offer when I make curtsy bid me farewell
