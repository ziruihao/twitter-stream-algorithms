Beforecellin his magic robes and Now does my project gather to a head My charms crack not my spirits obey and time Goes upright with his carriage How's the dayOn the sixth hour at which time my lord You said our work should ceaseI did say so When first I rais'd the tempest Say my spirit How fares the King and 's followersConfin'd together In the same fashion as you gave in charge Just as you left them all prisoners sir In the linegrove which weatherfends your cell They cannot budge till your release The King His brother and yours abide all three distracted And the remainder mourning over them Brim full of sorrow and dismay but chiefly Him you term'd sir 'the good old lord Gonzalo' His tears run down his beard like winter's drops From eaves of reeds Your charm so strongly works 'em That if you now beheld them your affections Would become tenderDost thou think so spiritMine would sir were I humanAnd mine shall Hast thou which art but air a touch a feeling Of their afflictions and shall not myself One of their kind that relish all as sharply Passion as they be kindlier mov'd than thou art Though with their high wrongs I am struck to th' quick Yet with my nobler reason 'gainst my fury Do I take part the rarer action is In virtue than in vengeance they being penitent The sole drift of my purpose doth extend Not a frown further Go release them Ariel My charms I'll break their senses I'll restore And they shall be themselvesI'll fetch them sirYe elves of hills brooks standing lakes and groves And ye that on the sands with printless foot Do chase the ebbing Neptune and do fly him When he comes back you demipuppets that By moonshine do the green sour ringlets make Whereof the ewe not bites and you whose pastime Is to make midnight mushrooms that rejoice To hear the solemn curfew by whose aid Weak masters though ye beI have bedimm'd The noontide sun call'd forth the mutinous winds And 'twixt the green sea and the azur'd vault Set roaring war To the dread rattling thunder Have I given fire and rifted Jove's stout oak With his own bolt the strongbas'd promontory Have I made shake and by the spurs pluck'd up The pine and cedar Graves at my command Have wak'd their sleepers op'd and let 'em forth By my so potent art But this rough magic I here abjure and when I have requir'd Some heavenly musicwhich even now I do To work mine end upon their senses that This airy charm is for I'll break my staff Bury it certain fathoms in the earth And deeper than did ever plummet sound I'll drown my bookSolem music Here s before thenwith frantic gesture attended byand in like manner attended by andThey allthe circle which had made and there stand charm'd which observing speaks A solemn air and the best comforter To an unsettled fancy cure thy brains Now useless boil'd within thy skull There stand For you are spellstopp'd Holy Gonzalo honourable man Mine eyes ev'n sociable to the show of thine Fall fellowly drops The charm dissolves apace And as the morning steals upon the night Melting the darkness so their rising senses Begin to chase the ignorant fumes that mantle Their clearer reason O good Gonzalo My true preserver and a loyal sir To him thou follow'st I will pay thy graces Home both in word and deed Most cruelly Didst thou Alonso use me and my daughter Thy brother was a furtherer in the act Thou art pinch'd for't now Sebastian Flesh and blood You brother mine that tain'd ambition Expell'd remorse and nature who with Sebastian Whose inward pinches therefore are most strong Would here have kill'd your king I do forgive thee Unnatural though thou art Their understanding Begins to swell and the approaching tide Will shortly fill the reasonable shore That now lies foul and muddy Not one of them That yet looks on me or would
