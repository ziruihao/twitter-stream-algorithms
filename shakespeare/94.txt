 Rome the conspirators' camp near Sardisand the plains of Philippi Rome A streetFlavius Marullus and certain CommonersHence home you idle creatures get you home Is this a holiday What know you not Being mechanical you ought not walk Upon a laboring day without the sign Of your profession Speak what trade art thouWhy sir a carpWhere is thy leather apron and thy rule What dost thou with thy best apparel on You sir what trade are youTruly sir in respect of a fine workman I am but as you would say a cobblerBut what trade art thou Answer me directlyA trade sir that I hope I may use with a safe conscience which is indeed sir a mender of bad solesWhat trade thou knave Thou naughty knave what tradeNay I beseech you sir be not out with me yet if you be out sir I can mend youWhat mean'st thou by that Mend me thou saucy fellowWhy sir cobble youThou art a cobbler art thouTruly Sir all that I live by is with the awl I meddle with no tradesman's matters nor women's matters but with awl I am indeed sir a surgeon to old shoes when they are in great danger I recover them As proper men as ever trod upon neat's leather have gone upon my handiworkBut wherefore art not in thy shop today Why dost thou lead these men about the streetsTruly sir to wear out their shoes to get myself into more work But indeed sir we make holiday to see Caesar and to rejoice in his triumphWherefore rejoice What conquest brings he home What tributaries follow him to Rome To grace in captive bonds his chariot wheels You blocks you stones you worse than senseless things O you hard hearts you cruel men of Rome Knew you not Pompey Many a time and oft Have you climb'd up to walls and battlements To towers and windows yea to chimney tops Your infants in your arms and there have sat The livelong day with patient expectation To see great Pompey pass the streets of Rome And when you saw his chariot but appear Have you not made an universal shout That Tiber trembled underneath her banks To hear the replication of your sounds Made in her concave shores And do you now put on your best attire And do you now cull out a holiday And do you now strew flowers in his way That comes in triumph over Pompey's blood Be gone Run to your houses fall upon your knees Pray to the gods to intermit the plague That needs must light on this ingratitudeGo go good countrymen and for this fault Assemble all the poor men of your sort Draw them to Tiber banks and weep your tears Into the channel till the lowest stream Do kiss the most exalted shores of all all Commoners See whether their basest metal be not moved They vanish tonguetied in their guiltiness Go you down that way towards the Capitol This way willDisrobe the images If you do find them deck'd with ceremoniesMay we do so You know it is the feast of LupercalIt is no matter let no images Be hung with Caesar's trophies I'll about And drive away the vulgar from the streets So do you too where you perceive them thick These growing feathers pluck'd from Caesar's wing Will make him fly an ordinary pitch Who else would soar above the view of men And keep us all in servile fearfulnessA public place FlourishCaesar Antony for the course Calpurnia Portia Decius Cicero Brutus Cassius and Casca a great crowd follows among them a SoothsayerCalpurniaPeace ho Caesar speaksMusic ceasesCalpurniaHere my lordStand you directly in Antonio's way When he doth run his course AntonioCaesar my lordForget not in your speed Antonio To touch Calpurnia for our elders say The barren touched in this holy chase Shake off their sterile curseI shall remember When Caesar says Do this it is perform'dSet on and leave no ceremony out FlourishCaesarHa Who callsBid every noise be still Peace yet againWho is it in the press that calls on me I hear a tongue shriller than all the music Cry Caesar Speak Caesar is turn'd to hearBeware the ides of MarchWhat man is thatA soothsayer you beware the ides of MarchSet him before me let me see his faceFellow come from the throng look upon CaesarWhat say'st thou to me now Speak once againBeware the ides of MarchHe is a dreamer let us leave him Pass Sennetall but Brutus and CassiusWill you go see the order of the courseNot I pray you doI am not gamesome I do lack some part Of that quick spirit that is in Antony Let me not hinder Cassius your desires I'll leave youBrutus I do observe you now of late I have not from your eyes that gentleness And show of love as I was wont to have You bear too stubborn and too strange a hand Over your friend that loves youCassius Be not deceived if I have veil'd my look I turn the trouble of my countenance Merely upon myself Vexed I am Of late with passions of some difference Conceptions only proper to myself Which give some soil perhaps to my behaviors But let not therefore my good friends be grieved Among which number Cassius be you one Nor construe any further my neglect Than that poor Brutus with himself at war Forgets the shows of love to other menThen Brutus I have much mistook your passion By means whereof this breast of mine hath buried Thoughts of great value worthy cogitations Tell me good Brutus can you see your faceNo Cassius for the eye sees not itself But by reflection by some other things'Tis just And it is very much lamented Brutus That you have no such mirrors as will turn Your hidden worthiness into your eye That you might see your shadow I have heard Where many of the best respect in Rome Except immortal Caesar speaking of Brutus And groaning underneath this age's yoke Have wish'd that noble Brutus had his eyesInto what dangers would you lead me Cassius That you would have me seek into myself For that which is not in meTherefore good Brutus be prepared to hear And since you know you cannot see yourself So well as by reflection I your glass Will modestly discover to yourself That of yourself which you yet know not of And be not jealous on me gentle Brutus Were I a common laugher or did use To stale with ordinary oaths my love To every new protester if you know That I do fawn on men and hug them hard And after scandal them or if you know That I profess myself in banqueting To all the rout then hold me dangerousFlourish and shoutWhat means this shouting I do fear the people Choose Caesar for their kingAy do you fear it Then must I think you would not have it soI would not Cassius yet I love him well But wherefore do you hold me here so long What is it that you would impart to me If it be aught toward the general good Set honor in one eye and death i' the other And I will look on both indifferently For let the gods so speed me as I love The name of honor more than I fear deathI know that virtue to be in you Brutus As well as I do know your outward favor Well honor is the subject of my story I cannot tell what you and other men Think of this life but for my single self I had as lief not be as live to be In awe of such a thing as I myself I was born free as Caesar so were you We both have fed as well and we can both Endure the winter's cold as well as he For once upon a raw and gusty day The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores Caesar said to me Darest thou Cassius now Leap in with me into this angry flood And swim to yonder point Upon the word Accoutred as I was I plunged in And bade him follow So indeed he did The torrent roar'd and we did buffet it With lusty sinews throwing it aside And stemming it with hearts of controversy But ere we could arrive the point proposed Caesar cried Help me Cassius or I sink I as Aeneas our great ancestor Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder The old Anchises bear so from the waves of Tiber Did I the tired Caesar And this man Is now become a god and Cassius is A wretched creature and must bend his body If Caesar carelessly but nod on him He had a fever when he was in Spain And when the fit was on him I did mark How he did shake 'Tis true this god did shake His coward lips did from their color fly And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world Did lose his luster I did hear him groan Ay and that tongue of his that bade the Romans Mark him and write his speeches in their books Alas it cried Give me some drink Titinius As a sick girl Ye gods It doth amaze me A man of such a feeble temper should So get the start of the majestic world And bear the palm alone ShoutFlourishAnother general shout I do believe that these applauses are For some new honors that are heap'd on CaesarWhy man he doth bestride the narrow world Like a Colossus and we petty men Walk under his huge legs and peep about To find ourselves dishonorable graves Men at some time are masters of their fates The fault dear Brutus is not in our stars But in ourselves that we are underlings Brutus and Caesar what should be in that Caesar Why should that name be sounded more than yours Write them together yours is as fair a name Sound them it doth become the mouth as well Weigh them it is as heavy conjure with 'em Brutus will start a spirit as soon as Caesar Now in the names of all the gods at once Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed That he is grown so great Age thou art shamed Rome thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods When went there by an age since the great flood But it was famed with more than with one man When could they say till now that talk'd of Rome That her wide walls encompass'd but one man Now is it Rome indeed and room enough When there is in it but one only man O you and I have heard our fathers say There was a Brutus once that would have brook'd The eternal devil to keep his state in Rome As easily as a kingThat you do love me I am nothing jealous What you would work me to I have some aim How I have thought of this and of these times I shall recount hereafter for this present I would not so with love I might entreat you Be any further moved What you have said I will consider what you have to say I will with patience hear and find a time Both meet to hear and answer such high things Till then my noble friend chew upon this Brutus had rather be a villager Than to repute himself a son of Rome Under these hard conditions as this time Is like to lay upon usI am glad that my weak words Have struck but thus much show of fire from Brutus Re Caesar and his TrainThe games are done and Caesar is returningAs they pass by pluck Casca by the sleeve And he will after his sour fashion tell you What hath proceeded worthy note todayI will do so But look you Cassius The angry spot doth glow on Caesar's brow And all the rest look like a chidden train Calpurnia's cheek is pale and Cicero Looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes As we have seen him in the Capitol Being cross'd in conference by some senatorsCasca will tell us what the matter isAntonioCaesarLet me have men about me that are fat Sleekheaded men and such as sleep o' nights Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look He thinks too much such men are dangerousFear him not Caesar he's not dangerous He is a noble Roman and well givenWould he were fatter But I fear him not Yet if my name were liable to fear I do not know the man I should avoid So soon as that spare Cassius He reads much He is a great observer and he looks Quite through the deeds of men He loves no plays As thou dost Antony he hears no music Seldom he smiles and smiles in such a sort As if he mock'd himself and scorn'd his spirit That could be moved to smile at anything Such men as he be never at heart's ease Whiles they behold a greater than themselves And therefore are they very dangerous I rather tell thee what is to be fear'd Than what I fear for always I am Caesar Come on my right hand for this ear is deaf And tell me truly what thou think'st of him SennetCaesar and all his Train but CascaYou pull'd me by the cloak would you speak with meAy Casca tell us what hath chanced today That Caesar looks so sadWhy you were with him were you notI should not then ask Casca what had chancedWhy there was a crown offered him and being offered himhe put it by with the back of his hand thus and then thepeople fell ashoutingWhat was the second noise forWhy for that tooThey shouted thrice What was the last cry forWhy for that tooWas the crown offered him thriceAy marry wast and he put it by thrice every time gentler than other and at every putting by mine honest neighbors shoutedWho offered him the crownWhy AntonyTell us the manner of it gentle CascaI can as well be hang'd as tell the manner of it It was mere foolery I did not mark it I saw Mark Antony offer him a crown yet 'twas not a crown neither 'twas one of these coronets and as I told you he put it by once But for all that to my thinking he would fain have had it Then he offered it to him again then he put it by again But to my thinking he was very loath to lay his fingers off it And then he offered it the third time he put it the third time by and still as he refused it the rabblement hooted and clapped their chopped hands and threw up their sweaty nightcaps and uttered such a deal of stinking breath because Caesar refused the crown that it had almost choked Caesar for he swounded and fell down at it And for mine own part I durst not laugh for fear of opening my lips and receiving the bad airBut soft I pray you what did Caesars woundHe fell down in the marketplace and foamed at mouth and was speechless'Tis very like He hath the falling sicknessNo Caesar hath it not but you and I And honest Casca we have the falling sicknessI know not what you mean by that but I am sure Caesar fell down If the tagrag people did not clap him and hiss him according as he pleased and displeased them as they use to do the players in the theatre I am no true manWhat said he when he came unto himselfMarry before he fell down when he perceived the common herd was glad he refused the crown he plucked me ope his doublet and offered them his throat to cut An had been a man of any occupation if I would not have taken him at a word I would I might go to hell among the rogues And so he fell When he came to himself again he said if he had done or said anything amiss he desired their worships to think it was his infirmity Three or four wenches where I stood cried Alas good soul and forgave him with all their hearts But there's no heed to be taken of them if Caesar had stabbed their mothers they would have done no lessAnd after that he came thus sad awayAyDid Cicero say anythingAy he spoke GreekTo what effectNay an I tell you that I'll ne'er look you i' the face again but those that understood him smiled at one another and shook their heads but for mine own part it was Greek to me I could tell you more news too Marullus and Flavius for pulling scarfs off Caesar's images are put to silence Fare you well There was more foolery yet if could remember itWill you sup with me tonight CascaNo I am promised forthWill you dine with me tomorrowAy if I be alive and your mind hold and your dinner worth the eatingGood I will expect youDo so farewell bothWhat a blunt fellow is this grown to be He was quick mettle when he went to schoolSo is he now in execution Of any bold or noble prise However he puts on this tardy form This rudeness is a sauce to his good wit Which gives men stomach to digest his words With better appetiteAnd so it is For this time I will leave you Tomorrow if you please to speak with me I will come home to you or if you will Come home to me and I will wait for youI will do so Till then think of the worldBrutus Well Brutus thou art noble yet I see Thy honorable mettle may be wrought From that it is disposed therefore it is meet That noble minds keep ever with their likes For who so firm that cannot be seduced Caesar doth bear me hard but he loves Brutus If I were Brutus now and he were Cassius He should not humor me I will this night In several hands in at his windows throw As if they came from several citizens Writings all tending to the great opinion That Rome holds of his name wherein obscurely Caesar's ambition shall be glanced at And after this let Caesar seat him sure For we will shake him or worse days endure A street Thunder and lightningfrom opposite sides Casca with his sword drawn and CiceroGood even Casca Brought you Caesar home Why are you breathless and why stare you soAre not you moved when all the sway of earth Shakes like a thing unfirm O Cicero I have seen tempests when the scolding winds Have rived the knotty oaks and I have seen The ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam To be exalted with the threatening clouds But never till tonight never till now Did I go through a tempest dropping fire Either there is a civil strife in heaven Or else the world too saucy with the gods Incenses them to send destructionWhy saw you anything more wonderfulA common slave you know him well by sight Held up his left hand which did flame and burn Like twenty torches join'd and yet his hand Not sensible of fire remain'd unscorch'd Besides I ha' not since put up my sword Against the Capitol I met a lion Who glaz'd upon me and went surly by Without annoying me And there were drawn Upon a heap a hundred ghastly women Transformed with their fear who swore they saw Men all in fire walk up and down the streets And yesterday the bird of night did sit Even at noonday upon the marketplace Howling and shrieking When these prodigies Do so conjointly meet let not men say These are their reasons they are natural For I believe they are portentous things Unto the climate that they point uponIndeed it is a strangedisposed time But men may construe things after their fashion Clean from the purpose of the things themselves Comes Caesar to the Capitol tomorrowHe doth for he did bid Antonio Send word to you he would be there tomorrowGood then Casca This disturbed sky Is not to walk inFarewell Cicero CiceroCassiusWho's thereA RomanCasca by your voiceYour ear is good Cassius what night is thisA very pleasing night to honest menWho ever knew the heavens menace soThose that have known the earth so full of faults For my part I have walk'd about the streets Submitting me unto the perilous night And thus unbraced Casca as you see Have bared my bosom to the thunderstone And when the cross blue lightning seem'd to open The breast of heaven I did present myself Even in the aim and very flash of itBut wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens It is the part of men to fear and tremble When the most mighty gods by tokens send Such dreadful heralds to astonish usYou are dull Casca and those sparks of life That should be in a Roman you do want Or else you use not You look pale and gaze And put on fear and cast yourself in wonder To see the strange impatience of the heavens But if you would consider the true cause Why all these fires why all these gliding ghosts Why birds and beasts from quality and kind Why old men fools and children calculate Why all these things change from their ordinance Their natures and preformed faculties To monstrous quality why you shall find That heaven hath infused them with these spirits To make them instruments of fear and warning Unto some monstrous state Now could I Casca name to thee a man Most like this dreadful night That thunders lightens opens graves and roars As doth the lion in the Capitol A man no mightier than thyself or me In personal action yet prodigious grown And fearful as these strange eruptions are'Tis Caesar that you mean is it not CassiusLet it be who it is for Romans now Have thews and limbs like to their ancestors But woe the while Our fathers' minds are dead And we are govern'd with our mothers' spirits Our yoke and sufferance show us womanishIndeed they say the senators tomorrow Mean to establish Caesar as a king And he shall wear his crown by sea and land In every place save here in ItalyI know where I will wear this dagger then Cassius from bondage will deliver Cassius Therein ye gods you make the weak most strong Therein ye gods you tyrants do defeat Nor stony tower nor walls of beaten brass Nor airless dungeon nor strong links of iron Can be retentive to the strength of spirit But life being weary of these worldly bars Never lacks power to dismiss itself If I know this know all the world besides That part of tyranny that I do bear I can shake off at pleasureThunder stillSo canSo every bondman in his own hand bears The power to cancel his captivityAnd why should Caesar be a tyrant then Poor man I know he would not be a wolf But that he sees the Romans are but sheep He were no lion were not Romans hinds Those that with haste will make a mighty fire Begin it with weak straws What trash is Rome What rubbish and what offal when it serves For the base matter to illuminate So vile a thing as Caesar But O grief Where hast thou led me I perhaps speak this Before a willing bondman then I know My answer must be made But I am arm'd And dangers are to me indifferentYou speak to Casca and to such a man That is no fleering telltale Hold my hand Be factious for redress of all these griefs And I will set this foot of mine as far As who goes farthestThere's a bargain made Now know you Casca I have moved already Some certain of the noblestminded Romans To undergo with me an prise Of honorabledangerous consequence And I do know by this they stay for me In Pompey's Porch For now this fearful night There is no stir or walking in the streets And the complexion of the element In favor's like the work we have in hand Most bloody fiery and most terrible CinnaStand close awhile for here comes one in haste'Tis Cinna I do know him by his gait He is a friend Cinna where haste you soTo find out you Who's that Metellus CimberNo it is Casca one incorporate To our attempts Am I not stay'd for CinnaI am glad on't What a fearful night is this There's two or three of us have seen strange sightsAm I not stay'd for Tell meYes you are O Cassius if you could But win the noble Brutus to our partyBe you content Good Cinna take this paper And look you lay it in the praetor's chair Where Brutus may but find it and throw this In at his window set this up with wax Upon old Brutus' statue All this done Repair to Pompey's Porch where you shall find us Is Decius Brutus and Trebonius thereAll but Metellus Cimber and he's gone To seek you at your house Well I will hie And so bestow these papers as you bade meThat done repair to Pompey's Theatre Cinna Come Casca you and I will yet ere day See Brutus at his house Three parts of him Is ours already and the man entire Upon the next encounter yields him oursO he sits high in all the people's hearts And that which would appear offense in us His countenance like richest alchemy Will change to virtue and to worthinessHim and his worth and our great need of him You have right well conceited Let us go For it is after midnight and ere day We will awake him and be sure of him
