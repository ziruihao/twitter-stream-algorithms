 SceneBangor The Archdeacon's houseHotspur Worcester Lord Mortimer Owen Glendower Mort These promises are fair the parties sure And our induction full of prosperous hope Hot Lord Mortimer and cousin Glendower Will you sit down And uncle Worcester A plague upon it I have forgot the map Glend No here it is Sit cousin Percy sit good cousin Hotspur For by that name as oft as Lancaster Doth speak of you his cheek looks pale and with A rising sigh he wisheth you in heaven Hot And you in hell as oft as he hears Owen Glendower spoke of Glend I cannot blame him At my nativity The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes Of burning cressets and at my birth The frame and huge foundation of the earth Shak'd like a coward Hot Why so it would have done at the same season if your mother's cat had but kitten'd though yourself had never been born Glend I say the earth did shake when I was born Hot And I say the earth was not of my mind If you suppose as fearing you it shook Glend The heavens were all on fire the earth did tremble Hot O then the earth shook to see the heavens on fire And not in fear of your nativity Diseased nature oftentimes breaks forth In strange eruptions oft the teeming earth Is with a kind of colic pinch'd and vex'd By the imprisoning of unruly wind Within her womb which for enlargement striving Shakes the old beldame earth and topples down Steeples and mossgrown towers At your birth Our grandam earth having this distemp'rature In passion shook Glend Cousin of many men I do not bear these crossings Give me leave To tell you once again that at my birth The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes The goats ran from the mountains and the herds Were strangely clamorous to the frighted fields These signs have mark'd me extraordinary And all the courses of my life do show I am not in the roll of common men Where is he living clipp'd in with the sea That chides the banks of England Scotland Wales Which calls me pupil or hath read to me And bring him out that is but woman's son Can trace me in the tedious ways of art And hold me pace in deep experiments Hot I think there's no man speaks better Welsh I'll to dinner Mort Peace cousin Percy you will make him mad Glend I can call spirits from the vasty deep Hot Why so can I or so can any man But will they come when you do call for them Glend Why I can teach you cousin to command the devil Hot And I can teach thee coz to shame the devil By telling truth Tell truth and shame the devil If thou have power to raise him bring him hither And I'll be sworn I have power to shame him hence O while you live tell truth and shame the devil Mort Come come no more of this unprofitable chat Glend Three times hath Henry Bolingbroke made head Against my power thrice from the banks of Wye And sandybottom'd Severn have I sent him Bootless home and weatherbeaten back Hot Home without boots and in foul weather too How scapes he agues in the devil's name Glend Come here's the map Shall we divide our right According to our threefold order ta'en Mort The Archdeacon hath divided it Into three limits very equally England from Trent and Severn hitherto By south and east is to my part assign'd All westward Wales beyond the Severn shore And all the fertile land within that bound To Owen Glendower and dear coz to you The remnant northward lying off from Trent And our indentures tripartite are drawn Which being sealed interchangeably A business that this night may execute Tomorrow cousin Percy you and I And my good Lord of Worcester will set forth To meet your father and the Scottish bower As is appointed us at Shrewsbury My father Glendower is not ready yet Nor shall we need his help these fourteen days To Glend Within that space you may have drawn together Your tenants friends and neighbouring gentlemen Glend A shorter time shall send me to you lords And in my conduct shall your ladies come From whom you now must steal and take no leave For there will be a world of water shed Upon the parting of your wives and you Hot Methinks my moiety north from Burton here In quantity equals not one of yours See how this river comes me cranking in And cuts me from the best of all my land A huge halfmoon a monstrous cantle out I'll have the current ill this place damm'd up And here the smug and sliver Trent shall run In a new channel fair and evenly It shall not wind with such a deep indent To rob me of so rich a bottom here Glend Not wind It shall it must You see it doth Mort Yea but Mark how he bears his course and runs me up With like advantage on the other side Gelding the opposed continent as much As on the other side it takes from you Wor Yea but a little charge will trench him here And on this north side win this cape of land And then he runs straight and even Hot I'll have it so A little charge will do it Glend I will not have it alt'red Hot Will not you Glend No nor you shall not Hot Who shall say me nay Glend No that willHot Let me not understand you then speak it in Welsh Glend I can speak English lord as well as you For I was train'd up in the English court Where being but young I framed to the harp Many an English ditty lovely well And gave the tongue a helpful ornament A virtue that was never seen in you Hot Marry And I am glad of it with all my heart I had rather be a kitten and cry mew Than one of these same metre balletmongers I had rather hear a brazen canstick turn'd Or a dry wheel grate on the axletree And that would set my teeth nothing on edge Nothing so much as mincing poetry 'Tis like the forc'd gait of a shuffling nag Glend Come you shall have Trent turn'd Hot I do not care I'll give thrice so much land To any welldeserving friend But in the way of bargain mark ye me I'll cavil on the ninth part of a hair Are the indentures drawn Shall we be gone Glend The moon shines fair you may away by night I'll haste the writer and withal Break with your wives of your departure hence I am afraid my daughter will run mad So much she doteth on her Mortimer Mort Fie cousin Percy how you cross my father Hot I cannot choose Sometimes he angers me With telling me of the moldwarp and the ant Of the dreamer Merlin and his prophecies And of a dragon and a finless fish A clipwing'd griffin and a moulten raven A couching lion and a ramping cat And such a deal of skimbleskamble stuff As puts me from my faith I tell you what He held me last night at least nine hours In reckoning up the several devils' names That were his lackeys I cried 'hum' and 'Well go to' But mark'd him not a word O he is as tedious As a tired horse a railing wife Worse than a smoky house I had rather live With cheese and garlic in a windmill far Than feed on cates and have him talk to me In any summer house in Christendom Mort In faith he is a worthy gentleman Exceedingly well read and profited In strange concealments valiant as a lion And wondrous affable and as bountiful As mines of India Shall I tell you cousin He holds your temper in a high respect And curbs himself even of his natural scope When you come 'cross his humour Faith he does I warrant you that man is not alive Might so have tempted him as you have done Without the taste of danger and reproof But do not use it oft let me entreat you Wor In faith my lord you are too wilfulblame And since your coming hither have done enough To put him quite besides his patience You must needs learn lord to amend this fault Though sometimes it show greatness courage blood And that's the dearest grace it renders you Yet oftentimes it doth present harsh rage Defect of manners want of government Pride haughtiness opinion and disdain The least of which haunting a nobleman Loseth men's hearts and leaves behind a stain Upon the beauty of all parts besides Beguiling them of commendation Hot Well I am school'd Good manners be your speed Here come our wives and let us take our leaveGlendower with the Ladies Mort This is the deadly spite that angers me My wife can speak no English I no Welsh Glend My daughter weeps she will not part with you She'll be a soldier too she'll to the wars Mort Good father tell her that she and my aunt Percy Shall follow in your conduct speedilyGlendower speaks to her in Welsh and she answers him in the same Glend She is desperate here A peevish selfwill'd harlotry One that no persuasion can do good uponThe Lady speaks in Welsh Mort I understand thy looks That pretty Welsh Which thou pourest down from these swelling heavens I am too perfect in and but for shame In such a Barley should I answer thee The Lady again in Welsh I understand thy kisses and thou mine And that's a feeling disputation But I will never be a truant love Till I have learnt thy language for thy tongue Makes Welsh as sweet as ditties highly penn'd Sung by a fair queen in a summer's bow'r With ravishing division to her lute Glend Nay if you melt then will she run madThe Lady speaks again in Welsh Mort O I am ignorance itself in this Glend She bids you on the wanton rushes lay you down And rest your gentle head upon her lap And she will sing the song that pleaseth you And on your eyelids crown the god of sleep Charming your blood with pleasing heaviness Making such difference 'twixt wake and sleep As is the difference betwixt day and night The hour before the heavenlyharness'd team Begins his golden progress in the East Mort With all my heart I'll sit and hear her sing By that time will our book I think be drawn Glend Do so And those musicians that shall play to you Hang in the air a thousand leagues from hence And straight they shall be here Sit and attend Hot Come Kate thou art perfect in lying down Come quick quick that I may lay my head in thy lap LadyGo ye giddy goose The music plays Hot Now I perceive the devil understands Welsh And 'tis no marvel be is so humorous By'r Lady he is a good musician LadyThen should you be nothing but musical for you are altogether govern'd by humours Lie still ye thief and hear the lady sing in Welsh Hot I had rather hear Lady my brach howl in Irish LadyWouldst thou have thy head broken Hot No LadyThen be still Hot Neither 'Tis a woman's fault LadyNow God help thee Hot To the Welsh lady's bed LadyWhat's that Hot Peace she singsHere the Lady sings a Welsh song Come Kate I'll have your song too LadyNot mine in good sooth Hot Not yours in good sooth Heart you swear like a comfitmaker's wife 'Not you in good sooth' and 'as true as I live' and 'as God shall mend me' and 'as sure as day' And givest such sarcenet surety for thy oaths As if thou ne'er walk'st further than Finsbury Swear me Kate like a lady as thou art A good mouthfilling oath and leave 'in sooth' And such protest of pepper gingerbread To velvet guards and Sunday citizens Come sing LadyI will not sing Hot 'Tis the next way to turn tailor or be redbreastteacher An the indentures be drawn I'll away within these two hours and so come in when ye will Glend Come come Lord Mortimer You are as slow As hot Lord Percy is on fire to go By this our book is drawn we'll but seal And then to horse immediately Mort With all my heartSceneLondon The Palacethe King Prince of Wales and others King Lords give us leave The Prince of Wales and I Must have some private conference but be near at hand For we shall presently have need of you Lords I know not whether God will have it so For some displeasing service I have done That in his secret doom out of my blood He'll breed revengement and a scourge for me But thou dost in thy passages of life Make me believe that thou art only mark'd For the hot vengeance and the rod of heaven To punish my mistreadings Tell me else Could such inordinate and low desires Such poor such bare such lewd such mean attempts Such barren pleasures rude society As thou art match'd withal and grafted to Accompany the greatness of thy blood And hold their level with thy princely heart Prince So please your Majesty I would I could Quit all offences with as clear excuse As well as I am doubtless I can purge Myself of many I am charged withal Yet such extenuation let me beg As in reproof of many tales devis'd Which oft the ear of greatness needs must bear By smiling pickthanks and base newsmongers I may for some things true wherein my youth Hath faulty wand'red and irregular And pardon on lily true submission King God pardon thee Yet let me wonder Harry At thy affections which do hold a wing Quite from the flight of all thy ancestors Thy place in Council thou hast rudely lost Which by thy younger brother is supplied And art almost an alien to the hearts Of all the court and princes of my blood The hope and expectation of thy time Is ruin'd and the soul of every man Prophetically do forethink thy fall Had I so lavish of my presence been So commonhackney'd in the eyes of men So stale and cheap to vulgar company Opinion that did help me to the crown Had still kept loyal to possession And left me in reputeless banishment A fellow of no mark nor likelihood By being seldom seen I could not stir But like a comet I Was wond'red at That men would tell their children 'This is he' Others would say 'Where Which is Bolingbroke' And then I stole all courtesy from heaven And dress'd myself in such humility That I did pluck allegiance from men's hearts Loud shouts and salutations from their mouths Even in the presence of the crowned King Thus did I keep my person fresh and new My presence like a robe pontifical Ne'er seen but wond'red at and so my state Seldom but sumptuous show'd like a feast And won by rareness such solemnity The skipping King he ambled up and down With shallow jesters and rash bavin wits Soon kindled and soon burnt carded his state Mingled his royalty with cap'ring fools Had his great name profaned with their scorns And gave his countenance against his name To laugh at gibing boys and stand the push Of every beardless vain comparative Grew a companion to the common streets Enfeoff'd himself to popularity That being dally swallowed by men's eyes They surfeited with honey and began To loathe the taste of sweetness whereof a little More than a little is by much too much So when he had occasion to be seen He was but as the cuckoo is in June Heard not regarded seen but with such eyes As sick and blunted with community Afford no extraordinary gaze Such as is bent on unlike majesty When it shines seldom in admiring eyes But rather drows'd and hung their eyelids down Slept in his face and rend'red such aspect As cloudy men use to their adversaries Being with his presence glutted gorg'd and full And in that very line Harry standest thou For thou hast lost thy princely privilege With vile participation Not an eye But is aweary of thy common sight Save mine which hath desir'd to see thee more Which now doth that I would not have it do Make blind itself with foolish tenderness Prince I shall hereafter my thricegracious lord Be more myself King For all the world As thou art to this hour was Richard then When I from France set foot at Ravenspurgh And even as I was then is Percy now Now by my sceptre and my soul to boot He hath more worthy interest to the state Than thou the shadow of succession For of no right nor colour like to right He doth fill fields with harness in the realm Turns head against the lion's armed jaws And Being no more in debt to years than thou Leads ancient lords and reverend Bishops on To bloody battles and to bruising arms What neverdying honour hath he got Against renowmed Douglas whose high deeds Whose hot incursions and great name in arms Holds from all soldiers chief majority And military title capital Through all the kingdoms that acknowledge Christ Thrice hath this Hotspur Mars in swathling clothes This infant warrior in his prises Discomfited great Douglas ta'en him once Enlarged him and made a friend of him To fill the mouth of deep defiance up And shake the peace and safety of our throne And what say you to this Percy Northumberland The Archbishop's Grace of York Douglas Mortimer Capitulate against us and are up But wherefore do I tell these news to thee Why Harry do I tell thee of my foes Which art my nearest and dearest enemy' Thou that art like enough through vassal fear Base inclination and the start of spleen To fight against me under Percy's pay To dog his heels and curtsy at his frowns To show how much thou art degenerate Prince Do not think so You shall not find it so And God forgive them that so much have sway'd Your Majesty's good thoughts away from me I will redeem all this on Percy's head And in the closing of some glorious day Be bold to tell you that I am your son When I will wear a garment all of blood And stain my favours in a bloody mask Which wash'd away shall scour my shame with it And that shall be the day whene'er it lights That this same child of honour and renown This gallant Hotspur this allpraised knight And your unthought of Harry chance to meet For every honour sitting on his helm Would they were multitudes and on my head My shames redoubled For the time will come That I shall make this Northern youth exchange His glorious deeds for my indignities Percy is but my factor good my lord To engross up glorious deeds on my behalf And I will call hall to so strict account That he shall render every glory up Yea even the slightest worship of his time Or I will tear the reckoning from his heart This in the name of God I promise here The which if he be pleas'd I shall perform I do beseech your Majesty may salve The longgrown wounds of my intemperance If not the end of life cancels all bands And I will die a hundred thousand deaths Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow King A hundred thousand rebels die in this Thou shalt have charge and sovereign trust hereinBlunt How now good Blunt Thy looks are full of speed Blunt So hath the business that I come to speak of Lord Mortimer of Scotland hath sent word That Douglas and the English rebels met The eleventh of this month at Shrewsbury A mighty and a fearful head they are If promises be kept oil every hand As ever off'red foul play in a state King The Earl of Westmoreland set forth today With him my son Lord John of Lancaster For this advertisement is five days old On Wednesday next Harry you shall set forward On Thursday we ourselves will march Our meeting Is Bridgenorth and Harry you shall march Through
