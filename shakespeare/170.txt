Bid him shed tears as being overjoyed To see her noble lord restor'd to health Who for this seven years hath esteemed him No better than a poor and loathsome beggar And if the boy have not a woman's gift To rain a shower of commanded tears An onion will do well for such a shift Which in a napkin being close convey'd Shall in despite enforce a watery eye See this dispatch'd with all the haste thou canst Anon I'll give thee more instructionsaI know the boy will well usurp the grace Voice gait and action of a gentlewoman I long to hear him call the drunkard 'husband' And how my men will stay themselves from laughter When they do homage to this simple peasant I'll in to counsel them haply my presence May well abate the overmerry spleen Which otherwise would grow into extremes A bedchamber

Ne'er ask me what raiment I'll wear for I have no more doublets than backs no more stockings than legs nor no more shoes than feet nay sometime more feet than shoes or such shoes as my toes look through the overleatherHeaven cease this idle humour in your honour O that a mighty man of such descent Of such possessions and so high esteem Should be infused with so foul a spiritWhat would you make me mad Am not I Christopher Sly old Sly's son of Burton Heath by birth a pedlar by education a cardmaker by transmutation a bearherd and now by present profession a tinker Ask Marian Hacket the fat alewife of Wincot if she know me not if she say I am not fourteen pence on the score for sheer ale score me up for the lying'st knave in Christendom What I am not bestraughtTaking a pot of ale Here'sO this it is that makes your lady mournO this is it that makes your servants droopHence comes it that your kindred shuns your house As beaten hence by your strange lunacy O noble lord bethink thee of thy birth Call home thy ancient thoughts from banishment And banish hence these abject lowly dreams Look how thy servants do attend on thee Each in his office ready at thy beck Wilt thou have music Hark Apollo playsMusic And twenty caged nightingales do sing Or wilt thou sleep We'll have thee to a couch Softer and sweeter than the lustful bed On purpose trimm'd up for Semiramis Say thou wilt walk we will bestrew the ground Or wilt thou ride Thy horses shall be trapp'd Their harness studded all with gold and pearl Dost thou love hawking Thou hast hawks will soar Above the morning lark Or wilt thou hunt Thy hounds shall make the welkin answer them And fetch shall echoes from the hollow earthSay thou wilt course thy greyhounds are as swift As breathed stags ay fleeter than the roeDost thou love pictures We will fetch thee straight Adonis painted by a running brook And Cytherea all in sedges hid Which seem to move and wanton with her breath Even as the waving sedges play wi' th' windWe'll show thee lo as she was a maid And how she was beguiled and surpris'd As lively painted as the deed was doneOr Daphne roaming through a thorny wood Scratching her legs that one shall swear she bleeds And at that sight shall sad Apollo weep So workmanly the blood and tears are drawnThou art a lord and nothing but a lord Thou hast a lady far more beautiful Than any woman in this waning ageAnd till the tears that she hath shed for thee Like envious floods o'errun her lovely face She was the fairest creature in the world And yet she is inferior to noneAm I a lord and have I such a lady Or do I dream Or have I dream'd till now I do not sleep I see I hear I speak I smell sweet savours and I feel soft things Upon my life I am a lord indeed And not a tinker nor Christopher Sly Well bring our lady hither to our sight And once again a pot o' th' smallest aleWill't please your Mightiness to wash your hands O how we joy to see your wit restor'd O that once more you knew but what you are These fifteen years you have been in a dream Or when you wak'd so wak'd as if you sleptThese fifteen years by my fay a goodly nap But did I never speak of all that timeO yes my lord but very idle words For though you lay here in this goodly chamber Yet would you say ye were beaten out of door And rail upon the hostess of the house And say you would present her at the leet Because she brought stone jugs and no seal'd quarts Sometimes you would call out for Cicely HacketAy the woman's maid of the houseWhy sir you know no house nor no such maid Nor no such men as you have reckon'd up As Stephen Sly and old John Naps of Greece And Peter Turph and Henry Pimpernell And twenty more such names and men as these Which never were nor no man ever sawNow Lord be thanked for my good amendsAmen the as a lady with I thank thee thou shalt not lose by itHow fares my noble lordMarry I fare well for here is cheer enough Where is my wifeHere noble lord what is thy will with herAre you

all this time abandon'd from your bed'Tis much Servants leave me and her aloneMadam undress you and come now to bedThrice noble lord let me entreat of you To pardon me yet for a night or two Or if not so until the sun be set For your physicians have expressly charg'd In peril to incur your former malady That I should yet absent me from your bed I hope this reason stands for my excuseAy it stands so that I may hardly tarry so long But I would be loath to fall into my dreams again I will therefore tarry in despite of the flesh and the blood a Your honour's players hearing your amendment Are come to play a pleasant comedy For so your doctors hold it very meet Seeing too much sadness hath congeal'd your blood And melancholy is the nurse of frenzy Therefore they thought it good you hear a play And frame your mind to mirth and merriment Which bars a thousand harms and lengthens lifeMarry I will let them play it Is not a comonty a Christmas gambold or a tumblingtrickNo my good lord it is more
