crown'd with consolation your old smock brings forth a new petticoat and indeed the tears live in an onion that should water this sorrowThe business she hath broached in the state Cannot endure my absenceAnd the business you have broach'd here cannot be without you especially that of Cleopatra's which wholly depends on your abodeNo more light answers Let our officers Have notice what we purpose I shall break The cause of our expedience to the Queen And get her leave to part For not alone The death of Fulvia with more urgent touches Do strongly speak to us but the letters to Of many our contriving friends in Rome Petition us at home Sextus Pompeius Hath given the dare to Caesar and commands The empire of the sea our slippery people Whose love is never link'd to the deserver Till his deserts are past begin to throw Pompey the Great and all his dignities Upon his son who high in name and power Higher than both in blood and life stands up For the main soldier whose quality going on

areThe gods best knowO never was there queen So mightily betray'd Yet at the first I saw the treasons plantedCleopatraWhy should I think you can be mine and true Though you in swearing shake the throned gods Who have been false to Fulvia Riotous madness To be entangled with those mouthmade vows Which break themselves in swearingMost sweet queenNay pray you seek no colour for your going But bid farewell and go When you sued staying Then was the time for words No going then Eternity was in our lips and eyes Bliss in our brows' bent none our parts so poor But was a race of heaven They are

powers Breed scrupulous faction the hated grown to strength Are newly grown to love The condemn'd Pompey Rich in his father's honour creeps apace Into the hearts of such as have not thrived Upon the present state whose numbers threaten And quietness grown sick of rest would purge By any desperate change My more particular And that which most with you should safe my going Is Fulvia's deathThough age from folly could not give me freedomIt does from childishness Can Fulvia dieShe's dead my Queen Look here and at thy sovereign leisure read The garboils she awak'd At the last best See when and where she diedO most false love Where be the sacred vials thou shouldst fill With sorrowful water Now I see I see In Fulvia's death how mine receiv'd shall beQuarrel no more but be prepar'd to know The purposes I bear which are or cease As you shall give th' advice By the fire That quickens Nilus' slime I go from hence Thy soldier servant making peace or war As thou affectsCut my lace Charmian come But let it be I am quickly ill and well So Antony lovesMy precious queen forbear And give true evidence to his love which stands An honourable trialSo Fulvia told me I prithee turn aside and weep for her Then bid adieu to me and say the tears Belong to Egypt Good now play one scene Of excellent dissembling and let it look Like perfect honourYou'll heat my blood no moreYou can do better yet but this is meetlyNow by my swordAnd target Still he mends But this is not the best Look prithee Charmian How this Herculean Roman does become The carriage of his chafeI'll leave you ladyCourteous lord one word Sir you and I must part but that's not it Sir you and I have lov'd but there's not it That you know well Something it is I would O my oblivion is a very Antony And I am all forgottenBut that your royalty Holds idleness your subject I should take you For idleness itself'Tis sweating labour To bear such idleness so near the heart As Cleopatra this But sir forgive me Since my becomings kill me when they do not Eye well to you Your honour calls you hence Therefore be deaf to my unpitied folly And all the gods go with you Upon your sword Sit laurel victory and smooth success Be strew'd before your feetLet us go Come Our separation so abides and flies That thou residing here goes yet with me And I hence fleeting here remain with thee Away Romehouse reading a letterand their trainYou may see Lepidus and henceforth know It is not Caesar's natural vice to hate Our great competitor From Alexandria This is the news he fishes drinks and wastes The lamps of night in revel is not more manlike Than Cleopatra nor the queen of Ptolemy More womanly than he hardly gave audience or Vouchsaf'd to think he had partners You shall find there A man who is the abstract of all faults That all men followI must not think there are Evils enow to darken all his goodness His faults in him seem as the spots of heaven More fiery by night's blackness hereditary Rather than purchas'd what he cannot change Than what he choosesYou are too indulgent Let's grant it is not Amiss to tumble on the bed of Ptolemy To give a kingdom for a mirth to sit And keep the turn of tippling with a slave To reel the streets at noon and stand the buffet With knaves that smell of sweat Say this becomes him As his composure must be rare indeed Whom these things cannot blemish yet must Antony No way excuse his foils when we do bear So great weight in his lightness If he fill'd His vacancy with his voluptuousness Full surfeits and the dryness of his bones Call on him for't But to confound such time That drums him from his sport and speaks as loud As his own state and ours 'tis to be chid As we rate boys who being mature in knowledge Pawn their experience to their present pleasure And so rebel to judgment a Here's more newsThy biddings have been done and every hour Most noble Caesar shalt thou have report How 'tis abroad Pompey is strong at sea And it appears he is belov'd of those That only have fear'd Caesar To the ports The discontents repair and men's reports Give him much wrong'dI should have known no less It hath been taught us from the primal state That he which is was wish'd until he were And the ebb'd man ne'er lov'd till ne'er worth love Comes dear'd by being lack'd This common body Like to a vagabond flag upon the stream Goes to and back lackeying the varying tide To rot itself with motionCaesar I bring thee word Menecrates and Menas famous pirates Make the sea serve them which they ear and wound With keels of every kind Many hot inroads They make in Italy the borders maritime Lack blood to think on't and flush youth revolt No vessel can peep forth but 'tis as soon Taken as seen for Pompey's name strikes more Than could his war resistedAntony Leave thy lascivious wassails When thou once Was beaten from Modena where thou slew'st Hirtius and Pansa consuls at thy heel Did famine follow whom thou fought'st against Though daintily brought up with patience more Than savages could suffer Thou didst drink The stale of horses and the gilded puddle Which beasts would cough at Thy palate then did deign The roughest berry on the rudest hedge Yea like the stag when snow the pasture sheets The barks of trees thou brows'd On the Alps It is reported thou didst eat strange flesh Which some did die to look on And all this It wounds thine honour that I speak it now Was borne so like a soldier that thy cheek So much as lank'd not'Tis pity of himLet his shames quickly Drive him to Rome 'Tis time we twain Did show ourselves i' th' field and to that end Assemble we immediate council Pompey Thrives in our idlenessTomorrow Caesar I shall be furnish'd to inform you rightly Both what by sea and land I can be able To front this present timeTill which encounter It is my

wrinkled deep in time Broadfronted Caesar When thou wast here above the ground I was A morsel for a monarch and great Pompey Would stand and make his eyes grow in my brow There would he anchor his aspect and die With looking on his life Sovereign of Egypt hailHow much unlike art thou Mark Antony Yet coming from him that great med'cine hath With his tinct gilded thee How goes it with my brave Mark AntonyLast thing he did dear Queen He kiss'd the last of many doubled kisses This orient pearl His speech sticks in my heartMine ear must pluck it thence'Good friend' quoth he ay the firm Roman to great Egypt sends This treasure of an oyster at whose foot To mend the petty present I will piece Her opulent throne with kingdoms All the East Say thou shall call her mistress' So he nodded And soberly did mount an armgaunt steed Who neigh'd so high that what I would have spoke Was beastly dumb'd by himWhat was he sad or merryLike to the time o' th' year between the extremes Of hot and cold
