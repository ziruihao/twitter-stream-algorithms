England and WalesSceneLondon The Palacethe King Lord John of Lancaster Earl of Westmoreland Sir Walter Blunt with others King So shaken as we are so wan with care Find we a time for frighted peace to pant And breathe shortwinded accents of new broils To be commenc'd in stronds afar remote No more the thirsty entrance of this soil Shall daub her lips with her own children's blood No more shall trenching war channel her fields Nor Bruise her flow'rets with the armed hoofs Of hostile paces Those opposed eyes Which like the meteors of a troubled heaven All of one nature of one substance bred Did lately meet in the intestine shock And furious close of civil butchery Shall now in mutual wellbeseeming ranks March all one way and be no more oppos'd Against acquaintance kindred and allies The edge of war like an illsheathed knife No more shall cut his master Therefore friends As far as to the sepulchre of Christ Whose soldier now under whose blessed cross We are impressed and engag'd to fight Forthwith a power of English shall we levy Whose arms were moulded in their mother's womb To chase these pagans in those holy fields Over whose acres walk'd those blessed feet Which fourteen hundred years ago were nail'd For our advantage on the bitter cross But this our purpose now is twelvemonth old And bootless 'tis to tell you we will go Therefore we meet not now Then let me hear Of you my gentle cousin Westmoreland What yesternight our Council did decree In forwarding this dear expedience West My liege this haste was hot in question And many limits of the charge set down But yesternight when all athwart there came A post from Wales loaden with heavy news Whose worst was that the noble Mortimer Leading the men of Herefordshire to fight Against the irregular and wild Glendower Was by the rude hands of that Welshman taken A thousand of his people butchered Upon whose dead corpse there was such misuse Such beastly shameless transformation By those Welshwomen done as may not be Without much shame retold or spoken of King It seems then that the tidings of this broil Brake off our business for the Holy Land West This match'd with other did my gracious lord For more uneven and unwelcome news Came from the North and thus it did import On Holyrood Day the gallant Hotspur there Young Harry Percy and brave Archibald That evervaliant and approved Scot At Holmedon met Where they did spend a sad and bloody hour As by discharge of their artillery And shape of likelihood the news was told For he that brought them in the very heat And pride of their contention did take horse Uncertain of the issue any way King Here is a dear a trueindustrious friend Sir Walter Blunt new lighted from his horse Stain'd with the variation of each soil Betwixt that Holmedon and this seat of ours And he hath brought us smooth and welcome news The Earl of Douglas is discomfited Ten thousand bold Scots twoandtwenty knights Balk'd in their own blood did Sir Walter see On Holmedon's plains Of prisoners Hotspur took Mordake Earl of Fife and eldest son To beaten Douglas and the Earl of Athol Of Murray Angus and Menteith And is not this an honourable spoil A gallant prize Ha cousin is it not West In faith It is a conquest for a prince to boast of King Yea there thou mak'st me sad and mak'st me sin In envy that my Lord Northumberland Should be the father to so blest a son A son who is the theme of honour's tongue Amongst a grove the very straightest plant Who is sweet Fortune's minion and her pride Whilst I by looking on the praise of him See riot and dishonour stain the brow Of my young Harry O that it could be prov'd That some nighttripping fairy had exchang'd In cradle clothes our children where they lay And call'd mine Percy his Plantagenet Then would I have his Harry and he mine But let him from my thoughts What think you coz Of this young Percy's pride The prisoners Which he in this adventure hath surpris'd To his own use he keeps and sends me word I shall have none but Mordake Earl of Fife West This is his uncle's teaching this Worcester Malevolent to you In all aspects Which makes him prune himself and bristle up The crest of youth against your dignity King But I have sent for him to answer this And for this cause awhile we must neglect Our holy purpose to Jerusalem Cousin on Wednesday next our council we Will hold at Windsor So inform the lords But come yourself with speed to us again For more is to be said and to be done Than out of anger can be uttered West I will my liege SceneLondon An apartment of the Prince'sPrince of Wales and Sir John Falstaff Fal Now Hal what time of day is it lad Prince Thou art so fatwitted with drinking of old sack and unbuttoning thee after supper and sleeping upon benches after noon that thou hast forgotten to demand that truly which thou wouldest truly know What a devil hast thou to do with the time of the day Unless hours were cups of sack and minutes capons and clocks the tongues of bawds and dials the signs of leaping houses and the blessed sun himself a fair hot wench in flamecoloured taffeta I see no reason why thou shouldst be so superfluous to demand the time of the day Fal Indeed you come near me now Hal for we that take purses go by the moon And the seven stars and not by Phoebus he that wand'ring knight so fair And I prithee sweet wag when thou art king as God save thy GraceMajesty I should say for grace thou wilt have none Prince What none Fal No by my troth not so much as will serve to be prologue to an egg and butter Prince Well how then Come roundly roundly Fal Marry then sweet wag when thou art king let not us that are squires of the night's body be called thieves of the day's beauty Let us be Diana's Foresters Gentlemen of the Shade Minions of the Moon and let men say we be men of good government being governed as the sea is by our noble and chaste mistress the moon under whose countenance we steal Prince Thou sayest well and it holds well too for the fortune of us that are the moon's men doth ebb and flow like the sea being governed as the sea is by the moon As for proof now a purse of gold most resolutely snatch'd on Monday night and most dissolutely spent on Tuesday morning got with swearing 'Lay by' and spent with crying 'Bring in' now ill as low an ebb as the foot of the ladder and byandby in as high a flow as the ridge of the gallows Fal By the Lord thou say'st true lad and is not my hostess of the tavern a most sweet wench Prince As the honey of Hybla my old lad of the castle and is not a buff jerkin a most sweet robe of durance Fal How now how now mad wag What in thy quips and thy quiddities What a plague have I to do with a buff jerkin Prince Why what a pox have I to do with my hostess of the tavern Fal Well thou hast call'd her to a reckoning many a time and oft Prince Did I ever call for thee to pay thy part Fal No I'll give thee thy due thou hast paid all there Prince Yea and elsewhere so far as my coin would stretch and where it would not I have used my credit Fal Yea and so us'd it that were it not here apparent that thou art heir apparent But I prithee sweet wag shall there be gallows standing in England when thou art king and resolution thus fubb'd as it is with the rusty curb of old father antic the law Do not thou when thou art king hang a thief Prince No thou shalt Fal Shall I O rare By the Lord I'll be a brave judge Prince Thou judgest false already I mean thou shalt have the hanging of the thieves and so become a rare hangman Fal Well Hal well and in some sort it jumps with my humour as well as waiting in the court I can tell you Prince For obtaining of suits Fal Yea for obtaining of suits whereof the hangman hath no lean wardrobe blood I am as melancholy as a gibcat or a lugg'd bear Prince Or an old lion or a lover's lute Fal Yea or the drone of a Lincolnshire bagpipe Prince What sayest thou to a hare or the melancholy of Moor Ditch Fal Thou hast the most unsavoury similes and art indeed the most comparative rascalliest sweet young prince But Hal I prithee trouble me no more with vanity I would to God thou and I knew where a commodity of good names were to be bought An old lord of the Council rated me the other day in the street about you sir but I mark'd him not and yet he talked very wisely but I regarded him not and yet he talk'd wisely and in the street too Prince Thou didst well for wisdom cries out in the streets and no man regards it Fal O thou hast damnable iteration and art indeed able to corrupt a saint Thou hast done much harm upon me Hal God forgive thee for it Before I knew thee Hal I knew nothing and now am I if a man should speak truly little better than one of the wicked I must give over this life and I will give it over By the Lord an I do not I am a villain I'll be damn'd for never a king's son in Christendom Prince Where shall we take a purse tomorrow Jack Fal Zounds where thou wilt lad I'll make one An I do not call me villain and baffle me Prince I see a good amendment of life in thee from praying to pursetaking Fal Why Hal 'tis my vocation Hal 'Tis no sin for a man to labour in his vocation Poins Poins Now shall we know if Gadshill have set a match O if men were to be saved by merit what hole in hell were hot enough for him This is the most omnipotent villain that ever cried tand' to a true man Prince Good morrow Ned Poins Good morrow sweet Hal What says Monsieur Remorse What says Sir John Sack and Sugar Jack how agrees the devil and thee about thy soul that thou soldest him on Good Friday last for a cup of Madeira and a cold capon's leg Prince Sir John stands to his word the devil shall have his bargain for he was never yet a breaker of proverbs He will give the devil his due Poins Then art thou damn'd for keeping thy word with the devil Prince Else he had been damn'd for cozening the devil Poins But my lads my lads tomorrow morning by four o'clock early at Gadshill There are pilgrims gong to Canterbury with rich offerings and traders riding to London with fat purses I have vizards for you all you have horses for yourselves Gadshill lies tonight in Rochester I have bespoke supper tomorrow night in Eastcheap We may do it as secure as sleep If you will go I will stuff your purses full of crowns if you will not tarry at home and be hang'd Fal Hear ye Yedward if I tarry at home and go not I'll hang you for going Poins You will chops Fal Hal wilt thou make one Prince Who I rob I a thief Not I by my faith Fal There's neither honesty manhood nor good fellowship in thee nor thou cam'st not of the blood royal if thou darest not stand for ten shillings Prince Well then once in my days I'll be a madcap Fal Why that's well said Prince Well come what will I'll tarry at home Fal By the Lord I'll be a traitor then when thou art king Prince I care not Poins Sir John I prithee leave the Prince and me alone I will lay him down such reasons for this adventure that he shall go Fal Well God give thee the spirit of persuasion and him the ears of profiting that what thou speakest may move and what he hears may be believed that the true prince may for recreation sake prove a false thief for the poor abuses of the time want countenance Farewell you shall find me in Eastcheap Prince Farewell thou latter spring farewell Allhallown summerFalstaff Poins Now my good sweet honey lord ride with us tomorrow I have a jest to execute that I cannot manage alone Falstaff Bardolph Peto and Gadshill shall rob those men that we have already waylaid yourself and I will not be there and when they have the booty if you and I do not rob them cut this head off from my shoulders Prince How shall we part with them in setting forth Poins Why we will set forth before or after them and appoint them a place of meeting wherein it is at our pleasure to fail and then will they adventure upon the exploit themselves which they shall have no sooner achieved but we'll set upon them Prince Yea but 'tis like that they will know us by our horses by our habits and by every other appointment to be ourselves Poins Tut our horses they shall not see I'll tie them in the wood our wizards we will change after we leave them and sirrah I have cases of buckram for the nonce to immask our noted outward garments Prince Yea but I doubt they will be too hard for us Poins Well for two of them I know them to be as truebred cowards as ever turn'd back and for the third if he fight longer than he sees reason I'll forswear arms The virtue of this jest will lie the incomprehensible lies that this same fat rogue will tell us when we meet at supper how thirty at least he fought with what wards what blows what extremities he endured and in the reproof of this lies the jest Prince Well I'll go with thee Provide us all things necessary and meet me tonight in Eastcheap There I'll sup Farewell Poins Farewell my lord Prince I know you all and will awhile uphold The unyok'd humour of your idleness Yet herein will I imitate the sun Who doth permit the base contagious clouds To smother up his beauty from the world That when he please again to lie himself Being wanted he may be more wond'red at By breaking through the foul and ugly mists Of vapours that did seem to strangle him If all the year were playing holidays To sport would be as tedious as to work But when they seldom come they wish'dfor come And nothing pleaseth but rare accidents So when this loose behaviour I throw off And pay the debt I never promised By how much better than my word I am By so much shall I falsify men's hopes And like bright metal on a sullen ground My reformation glitt'ring o'er my fault Shall show more goodly and attract more eyes Than that which hath no foil to set it off I'll so offend to make offence a skill Redeeming time when men think least I willSceneLondon The Palacethe King Northumberland Worcester Hotspur Sir Walter Blunt with others King My blood hath been too cold and temperate Unapt to stir at these indignities And you have found me for accordingly You tread upon my patience but be sure I will from henceforth rather be myself Mighty and to be fear'd than my condition Which hath been smooth as oil soft as young down And therefore lost that title of respect Which the proud soul ne'er pays but to the proud Wor Our house my sovereign liege little deserves The scourge of greatness to be us'd on it And that same greatness too which our own hands Have holp to make so portly North My lord King Worcester get thee gone for I do see Danger and disobedience in thine eye O sir your presence is too bold and peremptory And majesty might never yet endure The moody frontier of a servant brow Tou have good leave to leave us When we need 'Your use and counsel we shall send for you Worcester You were about to speak North Yea my good lord Those prisoners in your Highness' name demanded Which Harry Percy here at Holmedon took Were as he says not with such strength denied As is delivered to your Majesty Either envy therefore or misprision Is guilty of this fault and not my son Hot My liege I did deny no prisoners But I remember when the fight was done When I was dry with rage and extreme toll Breathless and faint leaning upon my sword Came there a certain lord neat and trimly dress'd Fresh as a bridegroom and his chin new reap'd Show'd like a stubble land at harvest home He was perfumed like a milliner And 'twixt his finger and his thumb he held A pouncet box which ever and anon He gave his nose and took't away again Who therewith angry when it next came there Took it in snuff and still he smil'd and talk'd And as the soldiers bore dead bodies by He call'd them untaught knaves unmannerly To bring a slovenly unhandsome corse Betwixt the wind and his nobility With many holiday and lady terms He questioned me amongst the rest demanded My prisoners in your Majesty's behalf I then all smarting with my wounds being cold To be so pest'red with a popingay Out of my grief and my impatience Answer'd neglectingly I know not what He should or he should not for he made me mad To see him shine so brisk and smell so sweet And talk so like a waiting gentlewoman Of guns and drums and wounds God save the mark And telling me the sovereignest thing on earth Was parmacity for an inward bruise And that it was great pity so it was This villanous saltpetre should be digg'd Out of the bowels of the harmless earth Which many a good tall fellow had destroy'd So cowardly and but for these vile 'guns He would himself have been a soldier This bald unjointed chat of his my lord I answered indirectly as I said And I beseech you let not his report Come current for an accusation Betwixt my love and your high majesty Blunt The circumstance considered good my lord Whate'er Lord Harry Percy then had said To such a person and in such a place At such a time with all the rest retold May reasonably die and never rise To do him wrong or any way impeach What then he said so he unsay it now King Why yet he doth deny his prisoners But with proviso and exception That we at our own charge shall ransom straight His brotherinlaw the foolish Mortimer Who on my soul hath wilfully betray'd The lives of those that he did lead to fight Against that great magician damn'd Glendower Whose daughter as we hear the Earl of March Hath lately married Shall our coffers then Be emptied to redeem a traitor home Shall we buy treason and indent with fears When they have lost and forfeited themselves No on the barren mountains let him starve For I shall never hold that man my friend Whose tongue shall ask me for one penny cost To ransom home revolted Mortimer Hot Revolted Mortimer He never did fall off my sovereign liege But by the chance of war To prove that true Needs no more but one tongue for all those wounds Those mouthed wounds which valiantly he took When on the gentle Severn's sedgy bank In single opposition hand to hand He did confound the best part of an hour In changing hardiment with great Glendower Three times they breath'd and three times did they drink Upon agreement of swift Severn's flood Who then affrighted with their bloody looks Ran fearfully among the trembling reeds And hid his crisp head in the hollow bank Bloodstained with these valiant cohabitants Never did base and rotten policy Colour her working with such deadly wounds Nor never could the noble Mortimer Receive so many and all willingly Then let not him be slandered with revolt King Thou dost belie him Percy thou dost belie him He never did encounter with Glendower I tell thee He durst as well have met the devil alone As Owen Glendower for an enemy Art thou not asham'd But sirrah henceforth Let me not hear you speak of Mortimer Send me your prisoners with the speediest means Or you shall hear in such a kind from me As will displease you My Lord Northumberland We license your departure with your son Send us your prisoners or you will hear of it King Blunt and Train Hot An if the devil come and roar for them I will not send them I will after straight And tell him so for I will else my heart Albeit I make a hazard of my head North What drunk with choler Stay and pause awhile Here comes your uncleWorcester Hot Speak of Mortimer Zounds I will speak of him and let my soul Want mercy if I do not join with him Yea on his part I'll empty all these veins And shed my dear blood drop by drop in the dust But I will lift the downtrod Mortimer As high in the air as this unthankful king As this ingrate and cank'red Bolingbroke North Brother the King hath made your nephew mad Wor Who struck this heat up after I was gone Hot He will forsooth have all my prisoners And when I urg'd the ransom once again Of my wive's brother then his cheek look'd pale And on my face he turn'd an eye of death Trembling even at the name of Mortimer Wor I cannot blame him Was not he proclaim'd By Richard that dead is the next of blood North He was I heard the proclamation And then it was when the unhappy King Whose wrongs in us God pardon did set forth Upon his Irish expedition From whence he intercepted did return To be depos'd and shortly murdered Wor And for whose death we in the world's wide mouth Live scandaliz'd and foully spoken of Hot But soft I pray you Did King Richard then Proclaim my brother Edmund Mortimer Heir to the crown North He did myself did hear it Hot Nay then I cannot blame his cousin king That wish'd him on the barren mountains starve But shall it be that you that set the crown Upon the head of this forgetful man And for his sake wear the detested blot Of murtherous subornation shall it be That you a world of curses undergo Being the agents or base second means The cords the ladder or the hangman rather O pardon me that I descend so low To show the line and the predicament Wherein you range under this subtile king Shall it for shame be spoken in these days Or fill up chronicles in time to come That men of your nobility and power Did gage them both in an unjust behalf As both of you God pardon it have done To put down Richard that sweet lovely rose And plant this thorn this canker Bolingbroke And shall it in more shame be further spoken That you are fool'd discarded and shook off By him for whom these shames ye underwent No yet time serves wherein you may redeem Your banish'd honours and restore yourselves Into the good thoughts of the world again Revenge the jeering and disdain'd contempt Of this proud king who studies day and night To answer all the debt he owes to you Even with the bloody payment of your deaths Therefore I say Wor Peace cousin say no more And now I will unclasp a secret book And to your quickconceiving discontents I'll read you matter deep and dangerous As full of peril and adventurous spirit As to o'erwalk a current roaring loud On the unsteadfast footing of a spear Hot If he fall in good night or sink or swim Send danger from the east unto the west So honour cross it from the north to south And let them grapple O the blood more stirs To rouse a lion than to start a hare North Imagination of some great exploit Drives him beyond the bounds of patience Hot By heaven methinks it were an easy leap To pluck bright honour from the palefac'd moon Or dive into the bottom of the deep Where fadom line could never touch the ground And pluck up drowned honour by the locks So he that doth redeem her thence might wear Without corrival all her dignities But out upon this halffac'd fellowship Wor He apprehends a world of figures here But not the form of what he should attend Good cousin give me audience for a while Hot I cry you mercy Wor Those same noble Scots That are your prisoners Hot I'll keep them all By God he shall not have a Scot of them No if a Scot would save his soul he shall not I'll keep them by this hand Wor You start away And lend no ear unto my purposes Those prisoners you shall keep Hot Nay I will That is flat He said he would not ransom Mortimer Forbade my tongue to speak of Mortimer But I will find him when he lies asleep And in his ear I'll holloa 'Mortimer' Nay I'll have a starling shall be taught to speak Nothing but 'Mortimer' and give it him To keep his anger still in motion Wor Hear you cousin a word Hot All studies here I solemnly defy Save how to gall and pinch this Bolingbroke And that same swordandbuckler Prince of Wales But that I think his father loves him not And would be glad he met with some mischance I would have him poisoned with a pot of ale Wor Farewell kinsman I will talk to you When you are better temper'd to attend North Why what a waspstung and impatient fool Art thou to break into this woman's mood Tying thine ear to no tongue but thine own Hot Why look you I am whipp'd and scourg'd with rods Nettled and stung with pismires when I hear Of this vile politician Bolingbroke In Richard's time what do you call the place A plague upon it it is in oucestershire 'Twas where the madcap Duke his uncle kept His uncle York where I first bow'd my knee Unto this king of smiles this Bolingbrokeblood When you and he came back from Ravenspurgh North At Berkeley Castle Hot You say true Why what a candy deal of courtesy This fawning greyhound then did proffer me Look 'when his infant fortune came to age' And 'gentle Harry Percy' and 'kind cousin' O the devil take such cozeners God forgive me Good uncle tell your tale for I have done Wor Nay if you have not to it again We will stay your leisure Hot I have done i' faith Wor Then once more to your Scottish prisoners Deliver them up without their ransom straight And make the Douglas' son your only mean For powers In Scotland which for divers reasons Which I shall send you written be assur'd Will easily be granted To Northumberland You my lord Your son in Scotland being thus employ'd Shall secretly into the bosom creep Of that same noble prelate wellbelov'd The Archbishop Hot Of York is it not Wor True who bears hard His brother's death at Bristow the Lord Scroop I speak not this in estimation As what I think might be but what I know Is ruminated plotted and set down And only stays but to behold the face Of that occasion that shall bring it on Hot I smell it Upon my life it will do well North Before the game is afoot thou still let'st slip Hot Why it cannot choose but be a noble plot And then the power of Scotland and of York To join with Mortimer ha Wor And so they shall Hot In faith it is exceedingly well aim'd Wor And 'tis no little reason bids us speed To save our heads by raising of a head For bear ourselves as even as we can The King will always think him in our debt And think we think ourselves unsatisfied Till he hath found a time to pay us home And see already how he doth begin To make us strangers to his looks of love Hot He does he does We'll be reveng'd on him Wor Cousin farewell No further go in this Than I by letters shall direct your course When time is ripe which will be suddenly I'll steal to Glendower and Lord Mortimer Where you and Douglas and our pow'rs at once As I will fashion it shall happily meet To bear our fortunes in our own strong arms Which now we hold at much uncertainty North Farewell good brother We shall thrive I trust Hot Uncle adieu O let the hours be short Till fields and blows and groans applaud our sport
