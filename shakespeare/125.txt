Venice A streetand Now what news on the RialtoWhy yet it lives there uncheck'd that Antonio hath a ship of rich lading wreck'd on the narrow seas the Goodwins I think they call the place a very dangerous flat and fatal where the carcases of many a tall ship lie buried as they say if my gossip Report be an honest woman of her wordI would she were as lying a gossip in that as ever knapp'd ginger or made her neighbours believe she wept for the death of a third husband But it is true without any slips of prolixity or crossing the plain highway of talk that the good Antonio the honest

what merchandise I will Go Tubal and meet me at our synagogue go good Tubal at our synagogue TubalBelmonthouseand all their trainsI pray you tarry pause a day or two Before you hazard for in choosing wrong I lose your company therefore forbear a while There's something tells me but it is not love I would not lose you and you know yourself Hate counsels not in such a quality But lest you should not understand me well And yet a maiden hath no tongue but thought I would detain you here some month or two Before you venture for me I could teach you How to choose right but then I am forsworn So will I never be so may you miss me But if you do you'll make me wish a sin That I had been forsworn Beshrew your eyes They have o'erlook'd me and divided me One half of me is yours the other half yours Mine own I would say but if mine then yours And so all yours O these naughty times Puts bars between the owners and their rights And so though yours not yours Prove it so Let fortune go to hell for it notI speak too long but 'tis to peize the time To eke it and to draw it out in length To stay you from electionLet me choose For as I am I live upon the rackUpon the rack Bassanio Then confess What treason there is mingled with your loveNone but that ugly treason of mistrust Which makes me fear th' enjoying of my love There may as well be amity and life 'Tween snow and fire as treason and my loveAy but I fear you speak upon the rack Where men enforced do speak anythingPromise me life and I'll confess the truthWell then confess and live'Confess' and 'love' Had been the very sum of my confession O happy torment when my torturer Doth teach me answers for deliverance But let me to my fortune and the casketsAway then I am lock'd in one of them If you do love me you will find me out Nerissa and the rest stand all aloof Let music sound while he doth make his choice Then if he lose he makes a swanlike end Fading in music That the comparison May stand more proper my eye shall be the stream And wat'ry deathbed for him He may win And what is music then Then music is Even as the flourish when true subjects bow To a newcrowned monarch such it is As are those dulcet sounds in break of day That creep into the dreaming bridegroom's ear And summon him to marriage Now he goes With no less presence but with much more love Than young Alcides when he did redeem The virgin tribute paid by howling Troy To the seamonster I stand for sacrifice The rest aloof are the Dardanian wives With bleared visages come forth to view The issue of th' exploit Go Hercules Live thou I live With much much more dismay I view the fight than thou that mak'st the fray Athe whilst comments on the caskets to himselfTell me where is fancy bredOr in the heart or in the headHow begot how nourishedReply replyIt is engend'red in the eyesWith gazing fed and fancy diesIn the cradle where it liesLet us all ring fancy's knellI'll begin it Ding dong bellDing dong bellSo may the outward shows be least themselves The world is still deceiv'd with ornament In law what plea so tainted and corrupt But being season'd with a gracious voice Obscures the show of evil In religion What damned error but some sober brow Will bless it and approve it with a text Hiding the grossness with fair ornament There is no vice so simple but assumes Some mark of virtue on his outward parts How many cowards whose hearts are all as false As stairs of sand wear yet upon their chins The beards of Hercules and frowning Mars Who inward search'd have livers white as milk And these assume but valour's excrement To render them redoubted Look on beauty And you shall see 'tis purchas'd by the weight Which therein works a miracle in nature Making them lightest that wear most of it So are those crisped snaky golden locks Which make such wanton gambols with the wind Upon supposed fairness often known To be the dowry of a second head The skull that bred them in the sepulchre Thus ornament is but the guiled shore To a most dangerous sea the beauteous scarf Veiling an Indian beauty in a word The seeming truth which cunning times put on To entrap the wisest Therefore thou gaudy gold Hard food for Midas I will none of thee Nor none of thee thou pale and common drudge 'Tween man and man but thou thou meagre lead Which rather threaten'st than dost promise aught Thy plainness moves me more than eloquence And here chooseJoy be the consequence AsideHow all the other passions fleet to air As doubtful thoughts and rashembrac'd despair And shudd'ring fear and greeney'd jealousy O love be moderate allay thy ecstasy In measure rain thy joy scant this excess I feel too much thy blessing Make it less For fear I surfeit Opening the leaden casketWhat find I here Fair Portia's counterfeit What demigod Hath come so near creation Move these eyes Or whether riding on the balls of mine Seem they in motion Here are sever'd lips Parted with sugar breath so sweet a bar Should sunder such sweet friends Here in her hairs The painter plays the spider and hath woven A golden mesh t' entrap the hearts of men Faster than gnats in cobwebs But her eyes How could he see to do them Having made one Methinks it should have power to steal both his And leave itself unfurnish'd Yet look how far The substance of my praise doth wrong this shadow In underprizing it so far this shadow Doth limp behind the substance Here's the scroll The continent and summary of my fortune'You that choose not by the viewChance as fair and choose as trueSince this fortune falls to youBe content and seek no newIf you be well pleas'd with thisAnd hold your fortune for your blissTurn to where your lady isAnd claim her with a loving kiss' A gentle scroll Fair lady by your leave I come by note to give and to receive Like one of two contending in a prize That thinks he hath done well in people's eyes Hearing applause and universal shout Giddy in spirit still gazing in a doubt Whether those peals of praise be his or no So thricefair lady stand I even so As doubtful whether what I see be true Until confirm'd sign'd ratified by youYou see me Lord Bassanio where I stand Such as I am Though for myself alone I would not be ambitious in my wish To wish myself much better yet for you I would be trebled twenty times myself A thousand times more fair ten thousand times more rich That only to stand high in your account I might in virtues beauties livings friends Exceed account But the full sum of me Is sum of something which to term in gross Is an unlesson'd girl unschool'd unpractis'd Happy in this she is not yet so old But she may learn happier than this She is not bred so dull but she can learn Happiest of all is that her gentle spirit Commits itself to yours to be directed As from her lord her governor her king Myself and what is mine to you and yours Is now converted But now I was the lord Of this fair mansion master of my servants Queen o'er myself and even now but now This house these servants and this same myself Are yours my lord's I give them with this ring Which when you part from lose or give away Let it presage the ruin of your love And be my vantage to exclaim on youMadam you have bereft me of all words Only my blood speaks to you in my veins And there is such confusion in my powers As after some oration fairly spoke By a beloved prince there doth appear Among the buzzing pleased multitude Where every something being blent together Turns to a wild of nothing save of joy Express'd and not express'd But when this ring Parts from this finger then parts life from hence O then be bold to say Bassanio's deadMy lord and lady it is now our time That have stood by and seen our wishes prosper To cry 'Good joy' Good joy my lord and ladyMy Lord Bassanio and my gentle lady I wish you all the joy that you can wish For I am sure you can wish none from me And when your honours mean to solemnize The bargain of your faith I do beseech you Even at that time I may be married tooWith all my heart so thou canst get a wifeI thank your lordship you have got me one My eyes my lord can look as swift as yours You saw the mistress I beheld the maid You lov'd I lov'd for intermission No more pertains to me my lord than you Your fortune stood upon the caskets there And so did mine too as the matter falls For wooing here until I sweat again And swearing till my very roof was dry With oaths of love at last if promise last I got a promise of this fair one here To have her love provided that your fortune Achiev'd her mistressIs this true NerissaMadam it is so you stand pleas'd withalAnd do you Gratiano mean

Could turn so much the constitution Of any constant man What worse and worse With leave Bassanio I am half yourself And I must freely have the half of anything That this same paper brings youO sweet Portia Here are a few of the unpleasant'st words That ever blotted paper Gentle lady When I did first impart my love to you I freely told you all the wealth I had Ran in my veins I was a gentleman And then I told you true And yet dear lady Rating myself at nothing you shall see How much I was a braggart When I told you My state was nothing I should then have told you That I was worse than nothing for indeed I have engag'd myself to a dear friend Engag'd my friend to his mere enemy To feed my means Here is a letter lady The paper as the body of my friend And every word in it a gaping wound Issuing lifeblood But is it true Salerio Hath all his ventures fail'd What not one hit From Tripolis from Mexico and England From Lisbon Barbary and India And not one vessel scape the dreadful touch Of merchantmarring rocksNot one my lord Besides it should appear that if he had The present money to discharge the Jew He would not take it Never did I know A creature that did bear the shape of man So keen and greedy to confound a man He plies the Duke at morning and at night And doth impeach the freedom of the state If they deny him justice Twenty merchants The Duke himself and the magnificoes Of greatest port have all persuaded with him But none can drive him from the envious plea Of forfeiture of justice and his bondWhen I was with him I have heard him swear To Tubal and to Chus his countrymen That he would rather have Antonio's flesh Than twenty times the value of the sum That he did owe him and I know my lord If law authority and power deny not It will go hard with poor AntonioIs it your dear friend that is thus in troubleThe dearest friend to me the kindest man The best condition'd and unwearied spirit In doing courtesies and one in whom The ancient Roman honour

Come away For you shall hence upon your wedding day Bid your friends welcome show a merry cheer Since you are dear bought I will love you dear But let me hear the letter of your friend Readsweet Bassanio my ships have all miscarried my creditors grow cruel my estate is very low my bond to the Jew is forfeit and since in paying it it is impossible I should live all debts are clear'd between you and I if I might but see you at my death Notwithstanding use your pleasure if your love do not persuade you to come let not my letter'O love dispatch all business and be goneSince I have your good leave to go away I will make haste but till I come again No bed shall e'er be guilty of my stay Nor rest be interposer 'twixt us twain Venice A street and Gaoler look to him Tell not me of mercy This is the fool that lent out money gratis Gaoler look to himHear me yet good ShylockI'll have my bond speak not against my bond I have sworn an oath that I will have my bond Thou call'dst me dog before thou hadst a cause But since I am a dog beware my fangs The Duke shall grant me justice I do wonder Thou naughty gaoler that thou art so fond To come abroad with him at his requestI pray thee hear me speakI'll have my bond I will not hear thee speak I'll have my bond and therefore speak no more I'll not be made a soft and dulley'd fool To shake the head relent and sigh and yield To Christian intercessors Follow not I'll have no speaking I will have my bond It is the most impenetrable cur That ever kept with menLet him alone I'll follow him no more with bootless prayers He seeks my life his reason well I know I oft deliver'd from his forfeitures Many that have at times made moan to me Therefore he hates meI am sure the Duke Will never grant this forfeiture to holdThe Duke cannot deny the course of law For the commodity that strangers have With us in Venice if it be denied Will much impeach the justice of the state Since that the trade and profit of the city Consisteth of all nations Therefore go These griefs and losses have so bated me That I shall hardly spare a pound of flesh Tomorrow to my bloody creditor Well gaoler on pray God Bassanio come To see me pay his debt and then I care notBelmonthouseand Madam although I speak it in your presence You have a noble and a true conceit Of godlike amity which appears most strongly In bearing thus the absence of your lord But if you knew to whom you show this honour How true a gentleman you send relief How dear a lover of my lord your husband I know you would be prouder of the work Than customary bounty can enforce youI never did repent for doing good Nor shall not now for in companions That do converse and waste the time together Whose souls do bear an equal yoke of love There must be needs a like proportion Of lineaments of manners and of spirit Which makes me think that this Antonio Being the bosom lover of my lord Must needs be like my lord If it be so How little is the cost I have bestowed In purchasing the semblance of my soul From out the state of hellish cruelty This comes too near the praising of myself Therefore no more of it hear other things Lorenzo I commit into your hands The husbandry and manage of my house Until my lord's return for mine own part I have toward heaven breath'd a secret vow To live in prayer and contemplation Only attended by Nerissa here Until her husband and my lord's return There is a monastery two miles off And there we will abide I do desire you Not to deny this imposition The which my love and some necessity Now lays upon youMadam with all my heart I shall obey you in an fair commandsMy people do already know my mind And will acknowledge you and Jessica In place of Lord Bassanio and myself So fare you well till we shall meet againFair thoughts and happy hours attend on youI wish your ladyship all heart's contentI thank you for your wish and am well pleas'd To wish it back on you Fare you well Jessica Now Balthasar As I have ever found thee honesttrue So let me find thee still Take this same letter And use thou all th' endeavour of a man In speed to Padua see thou render this Into my cousin's hands Doctor Bellario And look what notes and garments he doth give thee Bring them I pray thee with imagin'd speed Unto the traject to the common ferry Which trades to Venice Waste no time in words But get thee gone I shall be there before theeMadam I go with all convenient speed Come on Nerissa I have work in hand That you yet know not of we'll see our husbands Before they think of usShall they see usThey shall Nerissa but in such a habit That they shall think we are accomplished With that we lack I'll hold thee any wager When we are both accoutred like young men I'll prove the prettier fellow of the two And wear my dagger with the braver grace And speak between the change of man and boy With a reed voice and turn two mincing steps Into a manly stride and speak of frays Like a fine bragging youth and tell quaint lies How honourable ladies sought my love Which I denying they fell sick and died I could not do withal Then I'll repent And wish for all that that I had not kill'd them And twenty of these puny lies I'll tell That men shall swear I have discontinued school About a twelvemonth I have within my mind A thousand raw tricks of these bragging Jacks Which I will practiseWhy shall we turn to menFie what a question's that If thou wert near a lewd interpreter But come I'll tell thee all my whole device When I am in my coach which stays for us At the park gate and therefore haste away For we must measure twenty miles todayBelmont The gardenand Yes truly for look you the sins of the father are to be laid upon the children therefore I promise you I fear you I was always plain with you and so now I speak my agitation of the matter therefore be o' good cheer for truly I think you are damn'd There is but one hope in it that can do you any good and that is but a kind of bastard hope neitherAnd what hope is that I pray theeMarry you may partly hope that your father got you notthat you are not the Jew's daughterThat were a kind of bastard hope indeed so the sins of my mother should be visited upon meTruly then I fear you are damn'd both by father and mother thus when I shun Scylla your father I fall into Charybdis your mother well you are gone both waysI shall be sav'd by my husband he hath made me a ChristianTruly the more to blame he we were Christians enow before e'en as many as could well live one by another This making of Christians will raise the price of hogs if we grow all to be porkeaters we shall not shortly have a rasher on the coals for money I'll tell my husband Launcelot what you say here he comesI shall grow jealous of you shortly Launcelot if you thus get my wife into cornersNay you need nor fear us Lorenzo Launcelot and I are out he tells me flatly there's no mercy for me in heaven because I am a Jew's daughter and he says you are no good member of the commonwealth for in converting Jews to Christians you raise the price of porkI shall answer that better to the commonwealth than you can the getting up of the negro's belly the Moor is with child by you LauncelotIt is much that the Moor should be more than reason but if she be less than an honest woman she is indeed more than I took her forHow every fool can play upon the word I think the best grace of wit will shortly turn into silence and discourse grow commendable in none only but parrots Go in sirrah bid them prepare for dinnerThat is done sir they have all stomachsGoodly Lord what a witsnapper are you Then bid them prepare dinnerThat is done too sir only 'cover' is the wordWill you cover then sirNot so sir neither I know my dutyYet more quarrelling with occasion Wilt thou show the whole wealth of thy wit in an instant I pray thee understand a plain man in his plain meaning go to thy fellows bid them cover the table serve in the meat and we will come in to dinnerFor the table sir it shall be serv'd in for the meat sir it shall be cover'd for your coming in to dinner sir why let it be as humours and conceits shall governO dear discretion how his words are suited The fool hath planted in his memory An army of good words and I do know A many fools that stand in better place Garnish'd like him that for a tricksy word Defy the matter How cheer'st thou Jessica And now good sweet say thy opinion How dost thou like the Lord Bassanio's wifePast all expressing It is very meet The Lord Bassanio live an upright life For having such a blessing in his lady He finds the joys of heaven here on earth And if on earth he do not merit it In reason he should never come to heaven Why if two gods should play some heavenly match And on the wager lay two earthly women And Portia one there must be something else Pawn'd with the other for the poor rude world Hath not her fellowEven such a husband Hast thou of me as she is for a wifeNay but ask my opinion too of thatI will anon first let us go to dinnerNay let me praise you while I have a stomachNo pray thee let it serve for tabletalk Then howsome'er thou speak'st 'mong other things I shall digest itWell I'll set you forthVenice The court of justicethetheandWhat is Antonio hereReady so please your Grace I am sorry for thee thou art come to answer A stony adversary an inhuman wretch Uncapable of pity void and empty From any dram of mercyI have heard Your Grace hath ta'en great pains to qualify His rigorous course but since he stands obdurate And that no lawful means can carry me Out of his envy's reach I do oppose My patience to his fury and am arm'd To suffer with a quietness of spirit The very tyranny and rage of his Go one and call the Jew into the courtHe is ready at the door he comes my lord Make room and let him stand before our face Shylock the world thinks and I think so too That thou but leadest this fashion of thy malice To the last hour of act and then 'tis thought Thou'lt show thy mercy and remorse more strange Than is thy strange apparent cruelty And where thou now exacts the penalty Which is a pound of this poor merchant's flesh Thou wilt not only loose the forfeiture But touch'd with human gentleness and love Forgive a moiety of the principal Glancing an eye of pity on his losses That have of late so huddled on his back Enow to press a royal merchant down And pluck commiseration of his state From brassy bosoms and rough hearts of flint From stubborn Turks and Tartars never train'd To offices of tender courtesy We all expect a gentle answer JewI have possess'd your Grace of what I purpose And by our holy Sabbath have I sworn To have the due and forfeit of my bond If you deny it let the danger light Upon your charter and your city's freedom You'll ask me why I rather choose to have A weight of carrion flesh than to receive Three thousand ducats I'll not answer that But say it is my humour is it answer'd What if my house be troubled with a rat And I be pleas'd to give ten thousand ducats To have it ban'd What are you answer'd yet Some men there are love not a gaping pig Some that are mad if they behold a cat And others when the bagpipe sings i' th' nose Cannot contain their urine for affection Mistress of passion sways it to the mood Of what it likes or loathes Now for your answer As there is no firm reason to be rend'red Why he cannot abide a gaping pig Why he a harmless necessary cat Why he a woollen bagpipe but of force Must yield to such inevitable shame As to offend himself being offended So can I give no reason nor I will not More than a lodg'd hate and a certain loathing I bear Antonio that I follow thus A losing suit against him Are you answeredThis is no answer thou unfeeling man To excuse the current of thy crueltyI am not bound to please thee with my answersDo all men kill the things they do not loveHates any man the thing he would not killEvery offence is not a hate at firstWhat wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee twiceI pray you think you question with the Jew You may as well go stand upon the beach And bid the main flood bate his usual height You may as well use question with the wolf Why he hath made the ewe bleat for the lamb You may as well forbid the mountain pines To wag their high tops and to make no noise When they are fretten with the gusts of heaven You may as well do anything most hard As seek to soften that than which what's harder His jewish heart Therefore I do beseech you Make no moe offers use no farther means But with all brief and plain conveniency Let me have judgment and the Jew his willFor thy three thousand ducats here is sixIf every ducat in six thousand ducats Were in six parts and every part a ducat I would not draw them I would have my bond How shalt thou hope for mercy rend'ring noneWhat judgment shall I dread doing no wrong You have among you many a purchas'd slave Which fike your asses and your dogs and mules You use in abject and in slavish parts Because you bought them shall I say to you 'Let them be free marry them to your heirs Why sweat they under burdens let their beds Be made as soft as yours and let their palates Be season'd with such viands' You will answer 'The slaves are ours' So do I answer you The pound of flesh which I demand of him Is dearly bought 'tis mine and I will have it If you deny me fie upon your law There is no force in the decrees of Venice I stand for judgment answer shall I have it Upon my power I may dismiss this court Unless Bellario a learned doctor Whom I have sent for to determine this Come here todayMy lord here stays without A messenger with letters from the doctor New come from Padua Bring us the letters call the messengerGood cheer Antonio What man courage yet The Jew shall have my flesh blood bones and all Ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of bloodI am a tainted wether of the flock Meetest for death the weakest kind of fruit Drops earliest to the ground and so let me You cannot better be employ'd Bassanio Than to live still and write mine epitaph dressed like a lawyer's clerk Came you from Padua from BellarioFrom both my lord Bellario greets your GracePresents a letterWhy dost thou whet thy knife so earnestlyTo cut the forfeiture from that bankrupt thereNot on thy sole but on thy soul harsh Jew Thou mak'st thy knife keen but no metal can No not the hangman's axe bear half the keenness Of thy sharp envy Can no prayers pierce theeNo none that thou hast wit enough to makeO be thou damn'd inexecrable dog And for thy life let justice be accus'd Thou almost mak'st me waver in my faith To hold opinion with Pythagoras That souls of animals infuse themselves Into the trunks of men Thy currish spirit Govern'd a wolf who hang'd for human slaughter Even from the gallows did his fell soul fleet And whilst thou layest in thy unhallowed dam Infus'd itself in thee for thy desires Are wolfish bloody starv'd and ravenousTill thou canst rail the seal from off my bond Thou but offend'st thy lungs to speak so loud Repair thy wit good youth or it will fall To cureless ruin I stand here for law This letter from Bellario doth commend A young and learned doctor to our court Where is heHe attendeth here hard by To know your answer whether you'll admit him With all my heart Some three or four of you Go give him courteous conduct to this place Meantime the court shall hear Bellario's letter Reads'Your Grace shall understand that at the receipt of your letter I am very sick but in the instant that your messenger came in loving visitation was with me a young doctor of Rome his name is Balthazar I acquainted him with the cause in controversy between the Jew and Antonio the merchant we turn'd o'er many books together he is furnished with my opinion which bettered with his own learningthe greatness whereof I cannot enough commend comes with him at my importunity to fill up your Grace's request in my stead I beseech you let his lack of years be no impediment to let him lack a reverend estimation for I never knew so young a body with so old a head I leave him to your gracious acceptance whose trial shall better publish his commendation'fordressed like a Doctor of Laws hear the learn'd Bellario what he writes And here I take it is the doctor come Give me your hand come you from old BellarioI did my lord You are welcome take your place Are you acquainted with the difference That holds this present question in the courtI am informed throughly of the cause Which is the merchant here and which the Jew Antonio and old Shylock both stand forthIs your name ShylockShylock is my nameOf a strange nature is the suit you follow Yet in such rule that the Venetian law Cannot impugn you as you do proceed You stand within his danger do you notAy so he saysDo you confess the bondI doThen must the Jew be mercifulOn what compulsion must I Tell me thatThe quality of mercy is not strain'd It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven Upon the place beneath It is twice blest It blesseth him that gives and him that takes 'Tis mightiest in the mightiest it becomes The throned monarch better than his crown His sceptre shows the force of temporal power The attribute to awe and majesty Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings But mercy is above this sceptred sway It is enthroned in the hearts of kings It is an attribute to God himself And earthly power doth then show likest God's When mercy seasons justice Therefore Jew Though justice be thy plea consider this That in the course of justice none of us Should see salvation we do pray for mercy And that same prayer doth teach us all to render The deeds of mercy I have spoke thus much To mitigate the justice of thy plea Which if thou follow this strict court of Venice Must needs give sentence 'gainst the merchant thereMy deeds upon my head I crave the law The penalty and forfeit of my bondYes here I tender it for him in the court Yea twice the sum if that will not suffice I will be bound to pay it ten times o'er On forfeit of my hands my head my heart If this will not suffice it must appear That malice bears down truth And I beseech you Wrest once the law to your authority To do a great right do a little wrong And curb this cruel devil of his willIt must not be there is no power in Venice Can alter a decree established 'Twill be recorded for a precedent And many an error by the same example Will rush

your exposition Hath been most sound I charge you by the law Whereof you are a welldeserving pillar Proceed to judgment By my soul I swear There is no power in the tongue of man To alter me I stay here on my bondMost heartily I do beseech the court To give the judgmentWhy then thus it is You must prepare your bosom for his knifeO noble judge O excellent young manFor the intent and purpose of the law Hath full relation to the penalty Which here appeareth due upon the bond'Tis very true O wise and upright judge How much more elder art thou than thy looksTherefore lay bare your bosomAy his breast So says the bond doth it not noble judge 'Nearest his heart' those are the very wordsIt is so Are there balance here to weigh The fleshI have them readyHave by some surgeon Shylock on your charge To stop his wounds lest he do bleed to deathIs it so nominated in the bondIt is not so express'd but what of that 'Twere good you do so much for charityI cannot find it 'tis not in the bondYou merchant have you anything to sayBut little I am arm'd and well prepar'd Give me your hand Bassanio fare you well Grieve not that I am fall'n to this for you For herein Fortune shows herself more kind

me off Commend me to your honourable wife Tell her the process of Antonio's end Say how I lov'd you speak me fair in death And when the tale is told bid her be judge Whether Bassanio had not once a love Repent but you that you shall lose your friend And he repents not that he pays your debt For if the Jew do cut but deep enough I'll pay it instantly with all my heartAntonio I am married to a wife Which is as dear to me as life itself But life itself my wife and all the world Are not with me esteem'd above thy life I would lose all ay sacrifice them all Here to this devil to deliver

principalThou shalt have nothing but the forfeiture To be so taken at thy peril JewWhy then the devil give him good of it I'll stay no longer questionTarry Jew The law hath yet another hold on you It is enacted in the laws of Venice If it be proved against an alien That by direct or indirect attempts He seek the life of any citizen The party 'gainst the which he doth contrive Shall seize one half

appears by manifest proceeding That indirectly and directly too Thou hast contrived against the very life Of the defendant and thou hast incurr'd The danger formerly by me rehears'd Down therefore and beg mercy of the DukeBeg that thou mayst have leave to hang thyself And yet thy wealth being forfeit to the state Thou hast not left the value of a cord Therefore thou must be hang'd at the state's charge That thou shalt see the difference of our spirit I pardon thee thy life before thou ask it For half thy wealth it is Antonio's The other half comes to the general state Which humbleness may drive unto a fineAy for the state not for AntonioNay take my life and all pardon not that You take my house when you do take the prop That doth sustain my house you take my life When you do take the means whereby I liveWhat mercy can you render him AntonioA halter gratis nothing else for God's sakeSo please my lord the Duke and all the court To quit the fine for one half of his goods I am content

this I pray you pardon meI see sir you are liberal in offers You taught me first to beg and now methinks You teach me how a beggar should be answer'dGood sir this ring was given me by my wife And when she put it on she made me vow That I should neither sell nor give nor lose itThat 'scuse serves many men to save their gifts And if your wife be not a mad woman And know how well I have deserv'd this

thankfully And so I pray you tell him Furthermore I pray you show my youth old Shylock's houseThat will I doSir I would speak with you Aside to I'll See if I can get my husband's ring Which I did make him swear to keep for ever To Thou Mayst I warrant We shall have old swearing That they did give the rings away to men But we'll outface them and outswear them too AloudAway make haste thou know'st where I will tarryCome good sir will you show me to this house Belmont The garden beforehouseand The moon shines bright In such a night as this When the sweet wind did gently kiss the trees And they did make no noise in such a night Troilus methinks mounted the Troyan walls And sigh'd his soul toward the Grecian tents Where Cressid lay that nightIn such a night Did Thisby fearfully o'ertrip the dew And saw the lion's shadow ere himself And ran dismayed awayIn such a night Stood Dido with a willow in her hand Upon the wild seabanks and waft her love To come again to CarthageIn such a night Medea gathered the enchanted herbs That did renew old son In such a night Did Jessica steal from the wealthy Jew And with an unthrift love did run from Venice As far as BelmontIn such a night Did young Lorenzo swear he lov'd her well Stealing her soul with many vows of faith And ne'er a true oneIn such a night Did pretty Jessica like a little shrew Slander her love and he forgave it herI would outnight you did no body come But hark I hear the footing of a man Who comes so fast in silence of the nightA friendA friend What friend Your name I pray you friendStephano is my name and I bring word My mistress will before the break of day Be here at Belmont she doth stray about By holy crosses where she kneels and prays For happy wedlock hoursWho comes with herNone but a holy hermit and her maid I pray you is my master yet return'dHe is not nor we have not heard from him But go we in I pray thee Jessica And ceremoniously let us prepare Some welcome for the mistress of the house Sola sola wo ha ho sola solaWho callsSola Did you see Master Lorenzo Master Lorenzo Sola solaLeave holloaing man HereSola Where whereHereTell him there's a post come from my master with his horn full of good news my master will be here ere morningSweet soul let's in and there expect their coming And yet no matter why should we go in My friend Stephano signify I pray you Within the house your mistress is at hand And bring your music forth into the air How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank Here will we sit and let the sounds of music Creep in our ears soft stillness and the night Become the touches of sweet harmony Sit Jessica Look how the floor of heaven Is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold There's not the smallest orb which thou behold'st But in his motion like an angel sings Still quiring to the youngey'd cherubins Such harmony is in immortal souls But whilst this muddy vesture of decay Doth grossly close it in we cannot hear it Come ho and wake Diana with a hymn With sweetest touches pierce your mistress' ear And draw her home with musicMusicI am never merry when I hear sweet musicThe reason is your spirits are attentive For do but note a wild and wanton herd Or race of youthful and unhandled colts Fetching mad bounds bellowing and neighing loud Which is the hot condition of their blood If they but hear perchance a trumpet sound Or any air of music touch their ears You shall perceive them make a mutual stand Their savage eyes turn'd to a modest gaze By the sweet power of music Therefore the poet Did feign that Orpheus drew trees stones and floods Since nought so stockish hard and full of rage But music for the time doth change his nature The man that hath no music in himself Nor is not mov'd with concord of sweet sounds Is fit for treasons stratagems and spoils The motions of his spirit are dullas night And his affections dark as Erebus Let no such man be trusted Mark the musicand That light we see is burning in my hall How far that little candle throws his beams So shines a good deed in a naughty worldWhen the moon shone we did not see the candleSo doth the greater glory dim the less A substitute shines brightly as a king Until a king be by and then his state Empties itself as doth an inland brook Into the main of waters Music harkIt is your music madam of the houseNothing is good I see without respect Methinks it sounds much sweeter than by daySilence bestows that virtue on it madamThe crow doth sing as sweetly as the lark When neither is attended and I think ne nightingale if she should sing by day When every goose is cackling would be thought No better a musician than the wren How many things by season season'd are To their right praise and true perfection Peace ho The moon sleeps with Endymion And would not be awak'dMusic ceasesThat is the voice Or I am much deceiv'd of PortiaHe knows me as the blind man knows the cuckoo By the bad voiceDear lady welcome homeWe have been praying for our husbands' welfare Which speed we hope the better for our words Are they return'dMadam they are not yet But there is come a messenger before To signify their comingGo in Nerissa Give order to my servants that they take No note at all of our being absent hence Nor you Lorenzo Jessica nor youA tucket soundsYour husband is at hand I hear his trumpet We are no telltales madam fear you notThis night methinks is but the daylight sick It looks a little paler 'tis a day Such as the day is when the sun is hidand their followersWe should hold day with the Antipodes If you would walk in absence of the sunLet me give light but let me not be light For a light wife doth make a heavy husband And never be Bassanio so for me But God sort all You are welcome home my lordI thank you madam give welcome to my friend This is the man this is Antonio To whom I am so infinitely boundYou should in all sense be much bound to him For as I hear he was much bound for youNo more than I am well acquitted ofSir you are very welcome to our house It must appear in other ways than words Therefore I scant this breathing courtesy To By yonder moon I swear you do me wrong In faith I gave it to the judge's clerk Would he were gelt that had it for my part Since you do take it love so much at heartA quarrel ho already What's the matterAbout a hoop of gold a paltry ring That she did give me whose posy was For all the world like cutler's poetry Upon a knife 'Love me and leave me not'What talk you of the posy or the value You swore to me when I did give it you That you would wear it till your hour of death And that it should lie with you in your grave Though not for me yet for your vehement oaths You should have been respective and have kept it Gave it a judge's clerk No God's my judge The clerk will ne'er wear hair on's face that had itHe will an if he live to be a manAy if a woman live to be a manNow by this hand I gave it to a youth A kind of boy a little scrubbed boy No higher than thyself the judge's clerk A prating boy that begg'd it as a fee I could not for my heart deny it himYou were to blame I must be plain with you To part so slightly with your wife's first gift A thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger And so riveted with faith unto your flesh I gave my love a ring and made him swear Never to part with it and here he stands I dare be sworn for him he would not leave it Nor pluck it from his finger for the wealth That the world masters Now in faith Gratiano You give your wife too unkind a cause of grief An 'twere to me I should be mad at it AsideWhy I were best to cut my left hand off And swear I lost the ring defending itMy Lord Bassanio gave his ring away Unto the judge that begg'd it and indeed Deserv'd it too and then the boy his clerk That took some pains in writing he begg'd mine And neither man nor master would take aught But the two ringsWhat ring gave you my lord Not that I hope which you receiv'd of meIf I could add a lie unto a fault I would deny it but you see my finger Hath not the ring upon it it is goneEven so void is your false heart of truth By heaven I will ne'er come in your bed Until I see the ringNor I in yours Till I again see mineSweet Portia If you did know to whom I gave the ring If you did know for whom I gave the ring And would conceive for what I gave the ring And how unwillingly I left the ring When nought would be accepted but the ring You would abate the strength of your displeasureIf you had known the virtue of the ring Or half her worthiness that gave the ring Or your own honour to contain the ring You would not then have parted with the ring What man is there so much unreasonable If you had pleas'd to have defended it With any terms of zeal wanted the modesty To urge the thing held as a ceremony Nerissa teaches me what to believe I'll die for't but some woman had the ringNo by my honour madam by my soul No woman had it but a civil doctor Which did refuse three thousand ducats of me And begg'd the ring the which I did deny him And suffer'd him to go displeas'd away Even he that had held up the very life Of my dear friend What should I say sweet lady I was enforc'd to send it after him I was beset with shame and courtesy My honour would not let ingratitude So much besmear it Pardon me good lady For by these blessed candles of the night Had you been there I think you would have begg'd The ring of me to give the worthy doctorLet not that doctor e'er come near my house Since he hath got the jewel that I loved And that which you did swear to keep for me I will become as liberal as you I'll not deny him anything I have No not my body nor my husband's bed Know him I shall I am well sure of it Lie not a night from home watch me like Argus If you do not if I be left alone Now by mine honour which is yet mine own I'll have that doctor for mine bedfellowAnd I his clerk therefore be well advis'd How you do leave me to mine own protectionWell do you so let not me take him then For if I do I'll mar the young clerk's penI am th' unhappy subject of these quarrelsSir grieve not you you are welcome not withstandingPortia forgive me this enforced wrong And in the hearing of these many friends I swear to thee even by thine own fair eyes Wherein I see myselfMark you but that In both my eyes he doubly sees himself In each eye one swear by your double self And there's an oath of creditNay but hear me Pardon this fault and by my soul I swear I never more will break an oath with theeI once did lend my body for his wealth Which but for him that had your husband's ring Had quite miscarried I dare be bound again My soul upon the forfeit that your lord Will never more break faith advisedlyThen you shall be his surety Give him this And bid him keep it better than the otherHere Lord Bassanio swear to keep this ringBy heaven it is the same I gave the doctorI had it of him Pardon me Bassanio For by this ring the doctor lay with meAnd pardon me my gentle Gratiano For that same scrubbed boy the doctor's clerk In lieu of this last night did lie with meWhy this is like the mending of highways In summer where the ways are fair enough What are we cuckolds ere we have deserv'd itSpeak not so grossly You are all amaz'd Here is a letter read it at your leisure It comes from Padua from Bellario There you shall find that Portia was the doctor Nerissa there her clerk Lorenzo here Shall witness I set forth as soon as you And even but now return'd I have not yet 'd my house Antonio you are welcome And I have better news in store for you Than you expect Unseal this letter soon There you shall find three of your argosies Are richly come to harbour suddenly You shall not know by what strange accident I chanced on this letterI am dumbWere you the doctor and I knew you notWere you the clerk that is to make me cuckoldAy but the clerk that never means to do it Unless he live until he be a manSweet doctor you shall be my bedfellow When I am absent then lie with my wifeSweet lady you have given me life and living For here I read for certain that my ships Are safely come to roadHow now Lorenzo My clerk hath some good comforts too for youAy and I'll give them him without a fee There do I give to you and Jessica From the rich Jew a special deed of gift After his death of all he dies possess'd ofFair ladies you drop manna in the way Of starved peopleIt is almost morning And yet I am sure you are not satisfied Of these events at full Let us go in And charge us there upon inter'gatories And we will answer all things faithfullyLet it be so The first inter'gatory That my Nerissa shall be sworn on is Whether till the next night she had rather stay Or go to bed now being two hours to day But were the day come I should wish it dark Till I were couching with the doctor's clerk Well while I live I'll fear no other thing So sore as keeping safe Nerissa's ring
