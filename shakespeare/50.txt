Warkworth BeforeCastleWho keeps the gate here hoThe opens the gate Where is the EarlWhat shall I say you areTell thou the Earl That the Lord Bardolph doth attend him hereHis lordship is walk'd forth into the orchard Please it your honour knock but at the gate And he himself will answerHere comes the Earl What news Lord Bardolph Every minute now Should be the father of some stratagem The times are wild contention like a horse Full of high feeding madly hath broke loose And bears down all before himNoble Earl I bring you certain news from ShrewsburyGood an God willAs good as heart can wish The King is almost wounded to the death And in the fortune of my lord your son Prince Harry slain outright and both the Blunts Kill'd by the hand of Douglas young Prince John And Westmoreland and Stafford fled the field And Harry Monmouth's brawn the hulk Sir John Is prisoner to your son O such a day So fought so followed and so fairly won Came not till now to dignify the times Since Cxsar's fortunesHow is this deriv'd Saw you the field Came you from ShrewsburyI spake with one my lord that came from thence A gentleman well bred and of good name That freely rend'red me these news for true Here comes my servant Travers whom I sent On Tuesday last to listen after newsMy lord I overrode him on the way And he is furnish'd with no certainties More than he haply may retail from meNow Travers what good tidings comes with youMy lord Sir John Umfrevile turn'd me back With joyful tidings and being better hors'd Outrode me After him came spurring hard A gentleman almost forspent with speed That stopp'd by me to breathe his bloodied horse He ask'd the way to Chester and of him I did demand what news from Shrewsbury He told me that rebellion had bad luck And that young Harry Percy's spur was cold With that he gave his able horse the head And bending forward struck his armed heels Against the panting sides of his poor jade Up to the rowelhead and starting so He seem'd in running to devour the way Staying no longer questionHa Again Said he young Harry Percy's spur was cold Of Hotspur Coldspur that rebellion Had met ill luckMy lord I'll tell you what If my young lord your son have not the day Upon mine honour for a silken point I'll give my barony Never talk of itWhy should that gentleman that rode by Travers Give then such instances of lossWho he He was some hilding fellow that had stol'n The horse he rode on and upon my life Spoke at a venture Look here comes more newsMortonYea this man's brow like to a titleleaf Foretells the nature of a tragic volume So looks the strand whereon the imperious flood Hath left a witness'd usurpation Say Morton didst thou come from ShrewsburyI ran from Shrewsbury my noble lord Where hateful death put on his ugliest mask To fright our partyHow doth my son and brother Thou tremblest and the whiteness in thy cheek Is apter than thy tongue to tell thy errand Even such a man so faint so spiritless So dull so dread in look so woebegone Drew Priam's curtain in the dead of night And would have told him half his Troy was burnt But Priam found the fire ere he his tongue And I my Percy's death ere thou report'st it This thou wouldst say 'Your son did thus and thus Your brother thus so fought the noble Douglas' Stopping my greedy ear with their bold deeds But in the end to stop my ear indeed Thou hast a sigh to blow away this praise Ending with 'Brother son and all are dead'Douglas is living and your brother yet But for my lord your sonWhy he is dead See what a ready tongue suspicion hath He that but fears the thing he would not know Hath by instinct knowledge from others' eyes That what he fear'd is chanced Yet speak Morton Tell thou an earl his divination lies And I will take it as a sweet disgrace And make thee rich for doing me such wrongYou are too great to be by me gainsaid Your spirit is too true your fears too certainYet for all this say not that Percy's dead I see a strange confession in thine eye Thou shak'st thy head and hold'st it fear or sin To speak a truth If he be slain say so The tongue offends not that reports his death And he doth sin that doth belie the dead Not he which says the dead is not alive Yet the first bringer of unwelcome news Hath but a losing office and his tongue Sounds ever after as a sullen bell Rememb'red tolling a departing friendI cannot think my lord your son is deadI am sorry I should force you to believe That which I would to God I had not seen But these mine eyes saw him in bloody state Rend'ring faint quittance wearied and outbreath'd To Harry Monmouth whose swift wrath beat down The neverdaunted Percy to the earth From whence with life he never more sprung up In few his death whose spirit lent a fire Even to the dullest peasant in his camp Being bruited once took fire and heat away From the besttemper'd courage in his troops For from his metal was his party steeled Which once in him abated an the rest Turn'd on themselves like dull and heavy lead And as the thing that's heavy in itself Upon enforcement flies with greatest speed So did our men heavy in Hotspur's loss Lend to this weight such lightness with their fear That arrows fled not swifter toward their aim Than did our soldiers aiming at their safety Fly from the field Then was that noble Worcester Too soon ta'en prisoner and that furious Scot The bloody Douglas whose welllabouring sword Had three times slain th' appearance of the King Gan vail his stomach and did grace the shame Of those that turn'd their backs and in his flight Stumbling in fear was took The sum of all Is that the King hath won and hath sent out A speedy power to encounter you my lord Under the conduct of young Lancaster And Westmoreland This is the news at fullFor this I shall have time enough to mourn In poison there is physic and these news Having been well that would have made me sick Being sick have in some measure made me well And as the wretch whose feverweak'ned joints Like strengthless hinges buckle under life Impatient of his fit breaks like a fire Out of his keeper's arms even so my limbs Weak'ned with grief being now enrag'd with grief Are thrice themselves Hence therefore thou nice crutch A scaly gauntlet now with joints of steel Must glove this hand and hence thou sickly coif Thou art a guard too wanton for the head Which princes flesh'd with conquest aim to hit Now bind my brows with iron and approach The ragged'st hour that time and spite dare bring To frown upon th' enrag'd Northumberland Let heaven kiss earth Now let not Nature's hand Keep the wild flood confin'd Let order die And let this world no longer be a stage To feed contention in a ling'ring act But let one spirit of the firstborn Cain Reign in all bosoms that each heart being set On bloody courses the rude scene may end And darkness be the burier of the deadThis strained passion doth you wrong my lordSweet Earl divorce not wisdom from your honour The lives of all your loving complices Lean on your health the which if you give o'er To stormy passion must perforce decay You cast th' event of war my noble lord And summ'd the account of chance before you said 'Let us make head' It was your presurmise That in the dole of blows your son might drop You knew he walk'd o'er perils on an edge More likely to fall in than to get o'er You were advis'd his flesh was capable Of wounds and scars and that his forward spirit Would lift him where most trade of danger rang'd Yet did you say 'Go forth' and none of this Though strongly apprehended could restrain The stiffborne action What hath then befall'n Or what hath this bold prise brought forth More than that being which was like to beWe all that are engaged to this loss Knew that we ventured on such dangerous seas That if we wrought out life 'twas ten to one And yet we ventur'd for the gain propos'd Chok'd the respect of likely peril fear'd And since we are o'erset venture again Come we will put forth body and goods'Tis more than time And my most noble lord I hear for certain and dare speak the truth The gentle Archbishop of York is up With wellappointed pow'rs He is a man Who with a double surety binds his followers My lord your son had only but the corpse But shadows and the shows of men to fight For that same word 'rebellion' did divide The action of their bodies from their souls And they did fight with queasiness constrain'd As men drink potions that their weapons only Seem'd on our side but for their spirits and souls This word 'rebellion' it had froze them up As fish are in a pond But now the Bishop Turns insurrection to religion Suppos'd sincere and holy in his thoughts He's follow'd both with body and with mind And doth enlarge his rising with the blood Of fair King Richard scrap'd from Pomfret stones Derives from heaven his quarrel and his cause Tells them he doth bestride a bleeding land Gasping for life under great Bolingbroke And more and less do flock to follow himI knew of this before but to speak truth This present grief had wip'd it from my mind Go in with me and counsel every man The aptest way for safety and revenge Get posts and letters and make friends with speed Never so few and never yet more needLondon A street with his bearing his sword and bucklerSirrah you giant what says the doctor to my waterHe said sir the water itself was a good healthy water but for the party that owed it he might have moe diseases than he knew forMen of all sorts take a pride to gird at me The brain of this foolishcompounded clay man is not able to invent anything that intends to laughter more than I invent or is invented on me I am not only witty in myself but the cause that wit is in other men I do here walk before thee like a sow that hath overwhelm'd all her litter but one If the Prince put thee into my service for any other reason than to set me off why then I have no judgment Thou whoreson mandrake thou art fitter to be worn in my cap than to wait at my heels I was never mann'd with an agate till now but I will inset you neither in gold nor silver but in vile apparel and send you back again to your master for a jewel the juvenal the Prince your master whose chin is not yet fledge I will sooner have a beard grow in the palm of my hand than he shall get one off his cheek and yet he will not stick to say his face is a faceroyal God may finish it when he will 'tis not a hair amiss yet He may keep it still at a faceroyal for a barber shall never earn sixpence out of it and yet he'll be crowing as if he had writ man ever since his father was a bachelor He may keep his own grace but he's almost out of mine I can assure him What said Master Dommelton about the satin for my short cloak and my slopsHe said sir you should procure him better assurance than Bardolph He would not take his band and yours he liked not the securityLet him be damn'd like the Glutton pray God his tongue be hotter A whoreson Achitophel A rascalyeaforsooth knave to bear a gentleman in hand and then stand upon security The whoreson smoothpates do now wear nothing but high shoes and bunches of keys at their girdles and if a man is through with them in honest takingup then they must stand upon security I had as lief they would put ratsbane in my mouth as offer to stop it with security I look'd 'a should have sent me two and twenty yards of satin as I am a true knight and he sends me security Well he may sleep in security for he hath the horn of abundance and the lightness of his wife shines through it and yet cannot he see though he have his own lanthorn to light him Where's BardolphHe's gone into Smithfield to buy your worship horseI bought him in Paul's and he'll buy me a horse in Smithfield An I could get me but a wife in the stews I were mann'd hors'd and wiv'dthe and Sir here comes the nobleman that committed the Prince for striking him about BardolphWait close I will not see himWhat's he that goes thereFalstaff an't please your lordshipHe that was in question for the robb'ryHe my lord but he hath since done good service at Shrewsbury and as I hear is now going with some charge to the Lord John of LancasterWhat to York Call him back

knave and begging Is there not wars Is there not employment Doth not the King lack subjects Do not the rebels need soldiers Though it be a shame to be on any side but one it is worse shame to beg than to be on the worst side were it worse than the name of rebellion can tell how to make itYou mistake me sirWhy sir did I say you were an honest man Setting my knighthood and my soldiership aside I had lied in my throat if I had said soI pray you sir then set your knighthood and your soldiership aside and give me leave to tell you you in your throat if you say I am any other than an honest manI give thee leave to tell me so I lay aside that which grows to me If thou get'st any leave of me hang me if thou tak'st leave thou wert better be hang'd You hunt counter Hence AvauntSir my lord would speak with youSir John Falstaff a word with youMy good lord God give your lordship good time of day I am glad to see your lordship abroad I heard say your lordship was sick I hope your lordship goes abroad by advice Your lordship though not clean past your youth hath yet some smack of age in you some relish of the saltness of time and I most humbly beseech your lordship to have a reverend care of your healthSir John I sent for you before your expedition to ShrewsburyAn't please your lordship I hear his Majesty is return'd with some discomfort from WalesI talk not of his Majesty You would not come when I sent for youAnd I hear moreover his Highness is fall'n into this same whoreson apoplexyWell God mend him I pray you let me speak with youThis apoplexy as I take it is a kind of lethargy an't please your lordship a kind of sleeping in the blood a whoreson tinglingWhat tell you me of it Be it as it isIt hath it original from much grief from study and perturbation of the brain I have read the cause of his effects in Galen it is a kind of deafnessI think you are fall'n into the disease for you hear not what I say to youVery well my lord very well Rather an't please you it is the disease of not listening the malady of not marking that I am troubled withalTo punish you by the heels would amend the attention of your ears and I care not if I do become your physicianI am as poor as Job my lord but not so patient Your lordship may minister the potion of imprisonment to me in respect of poverty but how I should be your patient to follow your prescriptions the wise may make some dram of a scruple or indeed a scruple itselfI sent for you when there were matters against you for your life to come speak with meAs I was then advis'd by my learned counsel in the laws of this landservice I did not comeWell the truth is Sir John you live in great infamyHe that buckles himself in my belt cannot live in lessYour means are very slender and your waste is greatI would it were otherwise I would my means were greater and my waist slendererYou have misled the youthful PrinceThe young Prince hath misled me I am the fellow with the great belly and he my dogWell I am loath to gall a newheal'd wound Your day's service at Shrewsbury hath a little gilded over your night's exploit on Gadshill You may thank th' unquiet time for your quiet o'erposting that actionMy lordBut since all is well keep it so wake not a sleeping wolfTo wake a wolf is as bad as smell a foxWhat you are as a candle the better part burnt outA wassail candle my lord all tallow if I did say of wax my growth would approve the truthThere is not a white hair in your face but should have his effect of gravityHis effect of gravy gravyYou follow the young Prince up and down like his ill angelNot so my lord Your ill angel is light buthope he that looks upon me will take me without weighing And yet in some respects I grant I cannot go I cannot tell Virtue is of so little regard in these costermongers' times that true valour is turn'd berod pregnancy is made a tapster and his quick wit wasted in giving reckonings all the other gifts appertinent to man as the malice of this age shapes them are not worth a gooseberry You that are old consider not the capacities of us that are young you do measure the heat of our livers with the bitterness of your galls and we that are in the vaward of our youth must confess are wags tooDo you set down your name in the scroll of youth that are written down old with all the characters of age Have you not a moist eye a dry hand a yellow cheek a white beard a decreasing leg an increasing belly Is not your voice broken your wind short your chin double your wit single and every part about you blasted with antiquity And will you yet call yourself young Fie fie fie Sir JohnMy lord I was born about three of the clock in the afternoon with a white head and something a round belly For my voice I have lost it with hallooing and singing of anthems To approve my youth further I will not The truth is I am only old in judgment and understanding and he that will caper with me for a thousand marks let him lend me the money and have at him For the box of the ear that the Prince gave you he gave it like a rude prince and you took it like a sensible lord I have check'd him for it and the young lion repents marry not in ashes and sackcloth but in new silk and old sackWell God send the Prince a better companionGod send the companion a better prince I cannot rid my hands of himWell the King hath sever'd you I hear you are going with Lord John of Lancaster against the Archbishop and the Earl of NorthumberlandYea I thank your pretty sweet wit for it But look you pray all you that kiss my Lady Peace at home that our armies join not in a hot day for by the Lord I take but two shirts out with me and I mean not to sweat extraordinarily If it be a hot day and I brandish anything but a bottle I would I might never spit white again There is not a dangerous action can peep out his head but I am thrust upon it Well I cannot last ever but it was alway yet the trick of our English nation if they have a good thing to make it too common If ye will needs say I am an old man you should give me rest I would to God my name were not so terrible to the enemy as it is I were better to be eaten to death with a rust than to be scoured to nothing with perpetual motionWell be honest be honest and God bless your expeditionWill your lordship lend me a thousand pound to furnish me forthNot a penny not a penny you are too impatient to bear crosses Fare you well Commend me to my cousin WestmorelandIf I do fillip me with a threeman beetle A man can no more separate age and covetousness than 'a can part young limbs and lechery but the gout galls the one and the pox pinches the other and so both the degrees prevent my curses BoySirWhat money is in my purseSeven groats and two penceI can get no remedy against this consumption of the purse borrowing only lingers and lingers it out but the disease is incurable Go bear this letter to my Lord of Lancaster this to the Prince this to the Earl of Westmoreland and this to old Mistress Ursula whom I have weekly sworn to marry since I perceiv'd the first white hair of my chin About it you know where to find me A pox of this gout or a gout of this pox for the one or the other plays the rogue with my great toe 'Tis no matter if I do halt I have the wars for my colour and my pension shall seem the more reasonable A good wit will make use of anything I will turn diseases to commodityYork Thepalacethethe and Thus have you heard our cause and known our means And my most noble friends I pray you all Speak plainly your opinions of our hopes And first Lord Marshal what say you to itI well allow the occasion of our amis But gladly would be better satisfied How in our means we should advance ourselves To look with forehead bold and big enough Upon the power and puissance of the KingOur present musters grow upon the file To five and twenty thousand men of choice And our supplies live largely in the hope Of great Northumberland whose bosom burns With an incensed fire of injuriesThe question then Lord Hastings standeth thus Whether our present five and twenty thousand May hold up head without NorthumberlandWith him we mayYea marry there's the point But if without him we be thought too feeble My judgment is we should not step too far Till we had his assistance by the hand For in a theme so bloodyfac'd as this Conjecture expectation and surmise Of aids incertain should not be admitted'Tis very true Lord Bardolph for indeed It was young Hotspur's case at ShrewsburyIt was my lord who lin'd himself with hope Eating the air and promise of supply Flatt'ring himself in project of a power Much smaller than the smallest of his thoughts And so with great imagination Proper to madmen led his powers to death And winking leapt into destructionBut by your leave it never yet did hurt To lay down likelihoods and forms of hopeYes if this present quality of war Indeed the instant action a cause on foot Lives so in hope as in an early spring We see th' appearing buds which to prove fruit Hope gives not so much warrant as despair That frosts will bite them When we mean to build We first survey the plot then draw the model And when we see the figure of the house Then we must rate the cost of the erection Which if we find outweighs ability What do we then but draw anew the model In fewer offices or at least desist To build at all Much more in this great work Which is almost to pluck a kingdom down And set another up should we survey The plot of situation and the model Consent upon a sure foundation Question surveyors know our own estate How able such a work to undergo To weigh against his opposite or else We fortify in paper and in figures Using the names of men instead of men Like one that draws the model of a house Beyond his power to build it who half through Gives o'er and leaves his partcreated cost A naked subject to the weeping clouds And waste for churlish winter's tyrannyGrant that our hopes yet likely of fair birth Should be stillborn and that we now possess'd The utmost man of expectation I think we are so a body strong enough Even as we are to equal with the KingWhat is the King but five and twenty thousandTo us no more nay not so much Lord Bardolph For his divisions as the times do brawl Are in three heads one power against the French And one against Glendower perforce a third Must take up us So is the unfirm King In three divided and his coffers sound With hollow poverty and emptinessThat he should draw his several strengths together And come against us in full puissance Need not be dreadedIf he should do so He leaves his back unarm'd the French and Welsh Baying at his heels Never fear thatWho is it like should lead his forces hitherThe Duke of Lancaster and Westmoreland Against the Welsh himself and Harry Monmouth But who is substituted against the French I have no certain noticeLet us on And publish the occasion of our arms The commonwealth is sick of their own choice Their overgreedy love hath surfeited An habitation giddy and unsure Hath he that buildeth on the vulgar heart O thou fond many with what loud applause Didst thou beat heaven with blessing Bolingbroke Before he was what thou wouldst have him be And being now trimm'd in thine own desires Thou beastly feeder art so full of him That thou provok'st thyself to cast him up So so thou common dog didst thou disgorge Thy glutton bosom of the royal Richard And now thou wouldst eat thy dead vomit up And howl'st to find it What trust is in these times They that when Richard liv'd would have him die Are now become enamour'd on his grave Thou that threw'st dust upon his goodly head When through proud London he came sighing on After th' admired heels of Bolingbroke Criest now 'O earth yield us that king again And take thou this' O thoughts of men accurs'd Past and to come seems best things present worstShall we go draw our numbers and set onWe are time's subjects and time bids be gone
