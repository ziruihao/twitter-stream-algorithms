orchardand 'meetingHow now Where's thy master At my cousin Cressida'sNo sir he stays for you to conduct him thitherO here he comes How now how nowSirrah walk offBoyHave you seen my cousinNo Pandarus I stalk about her door Like a strange soul upon the Stygian banks Staying for waftage O be thou my Charon And give me swift transportance to these fields Where I may wallow in the lily beds Propos'd for the deserver O gentle Pandar From Cupid's shoulder pluck his painted wings And fly with me to CressidWalk here i' th' orchard I'll bring her straight I am giddy expectation whirls me round Th' imaginary relish is so sweet That it enchants my sense what will it be When that the wat'ry palate tastes indeed Love's thricerepured nectar Death I fear me Swooning destruction or some joy too fine Too subtlepotent tun'd too sharp in sweetness For the capacity of my ruder powers I fear it much and I do fear besides That I shall lose distinction in my joys As doth a battle when they charge on heaps The enemy flyingRe She's making her ready she'll come straight you must be witty now She does so blush and fetches her wind so short as if she were fray'd with a sprite I'll fetch her It is the prettiest villain she fetches her breath as short as a newta'en sparrow Even such a passion doth embrace my bosom My heart beats thicker than a feverous pulse And all my powers do their bestowing lose Like vassalage at unawares encount'ring The eye of majesty Re With Come come what need you blush Shame's a babyHere she is now swear the oaths now to her that you have sworn to me What are you gone again You must be watch'd ere you be made tame must you Come your ways come your ways an you draw backward we'll put you i' th' fillsWhy do you not speak to herCome draw this curtain and let's see your picture Alas the day how loath you are to offend daylight An 'twere dark you'd close sooner So so rub on and kiss the mistress How now a kiss in feefarm Build there carp the air is sweet Nay you shall fight your hearts out ere I part you The falcon as the tercel for all the ducks i' th' river Go to go toYou have bereft me of all words ladyWords pay no debts give her deeds but she'll bereave you o' th' deeds too if she call your activity in question What billing again Here's 'In witness whereof the parties interchangeably' Come in come in I'll go get a fire Will you walk in my lordO Cressid how often have I wish'd me thusWish'd my lord The gods grantO my lordWhat should they grant What makes this pretty abruption What too curious dreg espies my sweet lady in the fountain of our loveMore dregs than water if my fears have eyesFears make devils of cherubims they never see trulyBlind fear that seeing reason leads finds safer footing than blind reason stumbling without fear To fear the worst oft cures the worseO let my lady apprehend no fear In all Cupid's pageant there is presented no monsterNor nothing monstrous neitherNothing but our undertakings when we vow to weep seas live in fire cat rocks tame tigers thinking it harder for our mistress to devise imposition enough than for us to undergo any difficulty imposed This is the monstruosity in love lady that the will is infinite and the execution confin'd that the desire is boundless and the act a slave to limitThey say all lovers swear more performance than they are able and yet reserve an ability that they never perform vowing more than the perfection of ten and discharging less than the tenth part of one They that have the voice of lions and the act of hares are they not monstersAre there such Such are not we Praise us as we are tasted allow us as we prove our head shall go bare till merit crown it No perfection in reversion shall have a praise in present We will not name desert before his birth and being born his addition shall be humble Few words to fair faith Troilus shall be such to Cressid as what envy can say worst shall be a mock for his truth and what truth can speak truest not truer than TroilusWill you walk in my lord Re What blushing still Have you not done talking yetWell uncle what folly I commit I dedicate to youI thank you for that if my lord get a boy of you you'll give him me Be true to my lord if he flinch chide me for itYou know now your hostages your uncle's word and my firm faithNay I'll give my word for her too our kindred though they be long ere they are wooed they are constant being won they are burs I can tell you they'll stick where they are thrownBoldness comes to me now and brings me heart Prince Troilus I have lov'd you night and day For many weary monthsWhy was my Cressid then so hard to winHard to seem won but I was won my lord With the first glance that everpardon me If I confess much you will play the tyrant I love you now but till now not so much But I might master it In faith I lie My thoughts were like unbridled children grown Too headstrong for their mother See we fools Why have I blabb'd Who shall be true to us When we are so unsecret to ourselves But though I lov'd you well I woo'd you not And yet good faith I wish'd myself a man Or that we women had men's privilege Of speaking first Sweet bid me hold my tongue For in this rapture I shall surely speak The thing I shall repent See see your silence Cunning in dumbness from my weakness draws My very soul of counsel Stop my mouthAnd shall albeit sweet music issues thencePretty i' faithMy lord I do beseech you pardon me 'Twas not my purpose thus to beg a kiss I am asham'd O heavens what have I done For this time will I take my leave my lordYour leave sweet CressidLeave An you take leave till tomorrow morningPray you content youWhat offends you ladySir mine own companyYou cannot shun yourselfLet me go and try I have a kind of self resides with you But an unkind self that itself will leave To be another's fool I would be gone Where is my wit I know not what I speakWell know they what they speak that speak so wiselyPerchance my lord I show more craft than love And fell so roundly to a large confession To angle for your thoughts but you are wise Or else you love not for to be wise and love Exceeds man's might that dwells with gods aboveO that I thought it could be in a woman As if it can I will presume in you To feed for aye her lamp and flames of love To keep her constancy in plight and youth Outliving beauty's outward with a mind That doth renew swifter than blood decays Or that persuasion could but thus convince me That my integrity and truth to you Might be affronted with the match and weight Of such a winnowed purity in love How were I then uplifted but alas I am as true as truth's simplicity And simpler than the infancy of truthIn that I'll war with youO virtuous fight When right with right wars who shall be most right True swains in love shall in the world to come Approve their truth by Troilus when their rhymes Full of protest of oath and big compare Want similes truth tir'd with iteration As true as steel as plantage to the moon As sun to day as turtle to her mate As iron to adamant as earth to th' centre Yet after all comparisons of truth As truth's authentic author to be cited 'As true as Troilus' shall crown up the verse And sanctify the numbersProphet may you be If I be false or swerve a hair from truth When time is old and hath forgot itself When waterdrops have worn the stones of Troy And blind oblivion swallow'd cities up And mighty states characterless are grated To dusty nothingyet let memory From false to false among false maids in love Upbraid my falsehood when th' have said 'As false As air as water wind or sandy earth As fox to lamb or wolf to heifer's calf Pard to the hind or stepdame to her son' Yea let them say to stick the heart of falsehood 'As false as Cressid'Go to a bargain made seal it seal it I'll be the witness Here I hold your hand here my cousin's If ever you prove false one to another since I have taken such pains to bring you together let all pitiful goers between be call'd to the world's end after my namecall them all Pandars let all constant men be Troiluses all false women Cressids and all brokers between Pandars Say 'Amen'AmenAmenAmen Whereupon I will show you a chamber and a bed which bed because it shall not speak of your pretty encounters press it to death Away And Cupid grant all tonguetied maidens here Bed chamber pander to provide this gearThe Greek camp Flourishand Now Princes for the service I have done Th' advantage of the time prompts me aloud To call for recompense Appear it to your mind That through the sight I bear in things to come I have abandon'd Troy left my possession Incurr'd a traitor's name expos'd myself From certain and possess'd conveniences To doubtful fortunes sequest'ring from me all That time acquaintance custom and condition Made tame and most familiar to my nature And here to do you service am become As new into the world strange unacquainted I do beseech you as in way of taste To give me now a little benefit Out of those many regist'red in promise Which you say live to come in my behalfWhat wouldst thou of us Troyan Make demandYou have a Troyan prisoner call'd Antenor Yesterday took Troy holds him very dear Oft have youoften have you thanks therefore Desir'd my Cressid in right great exchange Whom Troy hath still denied but this Antenor I know is such a wrest in their affairs That their negotiations all must slack Wanting his manage and they will almost Give us a prince of blood a son of Priam In change of him Let him be sent great Princes And he shall buy my daughter and her presence Shall quite strike off all service I have done In most accepted painLet Diomedes bear him And bring us Cressid hither Calchas shall have What he requests of us Good Diomed Furnish you fairly for this interchange Withal bring word if Hector will tomorrow Be answer'd in his challenge Ajax is readyThis shall I undertake and 'tis a burden Which I am proud to bearand stand in their tentAchilles stands i' th' entrance of his tent Please it our general pass strangely by him As if he were forgot and Princes all Lay negligent and loose regard upon him I will come last 'Tis like he'll question me Why such unplausive eyes are bent why turn'd on him If so I have derision med'cinable To use between your strangeness and his pride Which his own will shall have desire to drink It may do good Pride hath no other glass To show itself but pride for supple knees Feed arrogance and are the proud man's feesWe'll execute your purpose and put on A form of strangeness as we pass along So do each lord and either greet him not Or else disdainfully which shall shake him more Than if not look'd on I will lead the wayWhat comes the general to speak with me You know my mind I'll fight no more 'gainst TroyWhat says Achilles Would he aught with usWould you my lord aught with the generalNoNothing my lordThe betterGood day good dayHow do you How do youWhat does the cuckold scorn meHow now PatroclusGood morrow AjaxHaGood morrowAy and good next day too What mean these fellows Know they not AchillesThey pass by strangely They were us'd to bend To send their smiles before them to Achilles To come as humbly as they us'd to creep To holy altarsWhat am I poor of late 'Tis certain greatness once fall'n out with fortune Must fall out with men too What the declin'd is He shall as soon read in the eyes of others As feel in his own fall for men like butterflies Show not their mealy wings but to the summer And not a man for being simply man Hath any honour but honour for those honours That are without him as place riches and favour Prizes of accident as oft as merit Which when they fall as being slippery standers The love that lean'd on them as slippery too Doth one pluck down another and together Die in the fall But 'tis not so with me Fortune and I are friends I do enjoy At ample point all that I did possess Save these men's looks who do methinks find out Something not worth in me such rich beholding As they have often given Here is Ulysses I'll interrupt his reading How now UlyssesNow great Thetis' sonWhat are you readingA strange fellow here Writes me that manhow dearly ever parted How much in having or without or in Cannot make boast to have that which he hath Nor feels not what he owes but by reflection As when his virtues shining upon others Heat them and they retort that heat again To the first giverThis is not strange Ulysses The beauty that is borne here in the face The bearer knows not but commends itself To others' eyes nor doth the eye itself That most pure spirit of sensebehold itself Not going from itself but eye to eye opposed Salutes each other with each other's form For speculation turns not to itself Till it hath travell'd and is mirror'd there Where it may see itself This is not strange at allI do not strain at the position It is familiarbut at the author's drift Who in his circumstance expressly proves That no man is the lord of anything Though in and of him there be much consisting Till he communicate his parts to others Nor doth he of himself know them for aught Till he behold them formed in th' applause Where th' are extended who like an arch reverb'rate The voice again or like a gate of steel Fronting the sun receives and renders back His figure and his heat I was much rapt in this And apprehended here immediately Th' unknown Ajax Heavens what a man is there A very horse that has he knows not what Nature what things there are Most abject in regard and dear in use What things again most dear in the esteem And poor in worth Now shall we see tomorrow An act that very chance doth throw upon him Ajax renown'd O heavens what some men do While some men leave to do How some men creep in skittish Fortune'shall Whiles others play the idiots in her eyes How one man eats into another's pride While pride is fasting in his wantonness To see these Grecian lordswhy even already They clap the lubber Ajax on the shoulder As if his foot were on brave Hector's breast And great Troy shrinkingI do believe it for they pass'd by me As misers do by beggarsneither gave to me Good word nor look What are my deeds forgotTime hath my lord a wallet at his back Wherein he puts alms for oblivion A greatsiz'd monster of ingratitudes Those scraps are good deeds past which are devour'd As fast as they are made forgot as soon As done Perseverance dear my lord Keeps honour bright To have done is to hang Quite out of fashion like a rusty mail In monumental mock'ry Take the instant way For honour travels in a strait so narrowWhere one but goes abreast Keep then the path For emulation hath a thousand sons That one by one pursue if you give way Or hedge aside from the direct forthright Like to an ent'red tide they all rush by And leave you hindmost Or like a gallant horse fall'n in first rank Lie there for pavement to the abject rear O'errun and trampled on Then what they do in present Though less than yours in past must o'ertop yours For Time is like a fashionable host That slightly shakes his parting guest by th' hand And with his arms outstretch'd as he would fly Grasps in the corner The welcome ever smiles And farewell goes out sighing O let not virtue seek Remuneration for the thing it was For beauty wit High birth vigour of bone desert in service Love friendship charity are subjects all To envious and calumniating Time One touch of nature makes the whole world kin That all with one consent praise newborn gawds Though they are made and moulded of things past And give to dust that is a little gilt More laud than gilt o'erdusted The present eye praises the present object Then marvel not thou great and complete man That all the Greeks begin to worship Ajax Since things in motion sooner catch the eye Than what stirs not The cry went once on thee And still it might and yet it may again If thou wouldst not entomb thyself alive And case thy reputation in thy tent Whose glorious deeds but in these fields of late Made emulous missions 'mongst the gods themselves And drave great Mars to factionOf this my privacy I have strong reasonsBut 'gainst your privacy The reasons are more potent and heroical 'Tis known Achilles that you are in love With one of Priam's daughtersHa knownIs that a wonder The providence that's in a watchful state Knows almost every grain of Plutus' gold Finds bottom in th' uncomprehensive deeps Keeps place with thought and almost like the gods Do thoughts unveil in their dumb cradles There is a mysterywith whom relation Durst never meddlein the soul of state Which hath an operation more divine Than breath or pen can give expressure to All the commerce that you have had with Troy As perfectly is ours as yours my lord And better would it fit Achilles much To throw down Hector than Polyxena But it must grieve young Pyrrhus now at home When fame shall in our island sound her trump And all the Greekish girls shall tripping sing 'Great Hector's sister did Achilles win But our great Ajax bravely beat down him' Farewell my lord I as your lover speak The fool slides o'er the ice that you should breakTo this effect Achilles have I mov'd you A woman impudent and mannish grown Is not more loath'd than an effeminate man In time of action I stand condemn'd for this They think my little stomach to the war And your great love to me restrains you thus Sweet rouse yourself and the weak wanton Cupid Shall from your neck unloose his amorous fold And like a dewdrop from the lion's mane Be shook to airy airShall Ajax fight with HectorAy and perhaps receive much honour by himI see my reputation is at stake My fame is shrewdly gor'dO then beware Those wounds heal ill that men do give themselves Omission to do what is necessary Seals a commission to a blank of danger And danger like an ague subtly taints Even then when they sit idly in the sunGo call Thersites hither sweet Patroclus I'll send the fool to Ajax and desire him T' invite the Troyan lords after the combat To see us here unarm'd I have a woman's longing An appetite that I am sick withal To see great Hector in his weeds of peace To talk with him and to behold his visage Even to my full of viewA labour sav'dA wonderWhatAjax goes up and down the field asking for himselfHow soHe must fight singly tomorrow with Hector and is so prophetically proud of an heroical cudgelling that he raves in saying nothingHow can that beWhy 'a stalks up and down like a peacocka stride and a stand ruminaies like an hostess that hath no arithmetic but her brain to set down her reckoning bites his lip with a politic regard as who should say 'There were wit in this head an 'twould out' and so there is but it lies as coldly in him as fire in a flint which will not show without knocking The man's undone for ever for if Hector break not his neck i' th' combat he'll break't himself in vainglory He knows not me I said 'Good morrow Ajax' and he replies 'Thanks Agamemnon' What think you of this man that takes me for the general He's grown a very land fish languageless a monster A plague of opinion A man may wear it on both sides like leather jerkinThou must be my ambassador to him ThersitesWho I Why he'll answer nobody he professes not answering Speaking is for beggars he wears his tongue in's arms I will put on his presence Let Patroclus make his demands to me you shall see the pageant of AjaxTo him Patroclus Tell him I humbly desire the valiant Ajax to invite the most valorous Hector to come unarm'd to my tent and to procure safe conduct for his person of the magnanimous and most illustrious sixorseventimeshonour'd Captain General of the Grecian army et cetera Agamemnon Do thisJove bless great AjaxHumI come from the worthy AchillesHaWho most humbly desires you to invite Hector to his tentHumAnd to procure safe conduct from AgamemnonAgamemnonAy my lordHaWhat you say to'tGod buy you with all my heartYour answer sirIf tomorrow be a fair day by eleven of the clock it will go one way or other Howsoever he shall pay for me ere he has meYour answer sirFare ye well with all my heartWhy but he is not in this tune is heNo but he's out a tune thus What music will be in him when Hector has knock'd out his brains I know not but I am sure none unless the fiddler Apollo get his sinews to make catlings onCome thou shalt bear a letter to him straightLet me carry another to his horse for that's the more capable creatureMy mind is troubled like a fountain stirr'd And I myself see not the bottom of itWould the fountain of your mind were clear again that I might water an ass at it I had rather be a tick in a sheep than such a valiant ignorance
