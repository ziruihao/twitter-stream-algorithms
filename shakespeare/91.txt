England A castleand Heat me these irons hot and look thou stand Within the arras When I strike my foot Upon the bosom of the ground rush forth And bind the boy which you shall find with me Fast to the chair Be heedful hence and watchI hope your warrant will bear out the deedUncleanly scruples Fear not you Look to't Young lad come forth I have to say with youGood morrow HubertGood morrow little PrinceAs little prince having so great a tide To be more prince as may be You are sadIndeed I have been merrierMercy on me Methinks no body should be sad but I Yet I remember when I was in France Young gentlemen would be as sad as night Only for wantonness By my christendom So I were out of prison and kept sheep I should be as merry as the day is long And so I would be here but that I doubt My uncle practises more harm to me He is afraid of me and I of him Is it my fault that I was Geffrey's son No indeed ist not and I would to heaven I were your son so you would love me Hubert AsideIf I talk to him with his innocent prate He will awake my mercy which lies dead Therefore I will be sudden and dispatchAre you sick Hubert You look pale today In sooth I would you were a little sick That I might sit all night and watch with you I warrant I love you more than you do me AsideHis words do take possession of my bosom Read here young ArthurShowing a paper AsideHow now foolish rheum Turning dispiteous torture out of door I must be brief lest resolution drop Out at mine eyes in tender womanish tears Can you not read it Is it not fair writToo fairly Hubert for so foul effect Must you with hot irons burn out both mine eyesYoung boy I mustAnd will youAnd I willHave you the heart When your head did but ache I knit my handkerchief about your brows The best I had a princess wrought it me And I did never ask it you again And with my hand at midnight held your head And like the watchful minutes to the hour Still and anon cheer'd up the heavy time Saying 'What lack you' and 'Where lies your grief' Or 'What good love may I perform for you' Many a poor man's son would have lyen still And ne'er have spoke a loving word to you But you at your sick service had a prince Nay you may think my love was crafty love And call it cunning Do an if you will If heaven be pleas'd that you must use me ill Why then you must Will you put out mine eyes These eyes that never did nor never shall So much as frown on youI have sworn to do it And with hot irons must I burn them outAh none but in this iron age would do it The iron of itself though heat redhot Approaching near these eyes would drink my tears And quench his fiery indignation Even in the matter of mine innocence Nay after that consume away in rust But for containing fire to harm mine eye Are you more stubbornhard than hammer'd iron An if an angel should have come to me And told me Hubert should put out mine eyes I would not have believ'd himno tongue but Hubert's StampsCome forthReWith cord irons etc Do as I bid you doO save me Hubert save me My eyes are out Even with the fierce looks of these bloody menGive me the iron I say and bind him hereAlas what need you be so boist'rous rough I will not struggle I will stand stonestill For heaven sake Hubert let me not be bound Nay hear me Hubert Drive these men away And I will sit as quiet as a lamb I will not stir nor wince nor speak a word Nor look upon the iron angrily Thrust but these men away and I'll forgive you Whatever torment you do put me toGo stand within let me alone with himI am best pleas'd to be from such a deedAlas I then have chid away my friend He hath a stern look but a gentle heart Let him come back that his compassion may Give life to yoursCome boy prepare yourselfIs there no remedyNone but to lose your eyesO heaven that there were but a mote in yours A grain a dust a gnat a wandering hair Any annoyance in that precious sense Then feeling what small things are boisterous there Your vile intent must needs seem horribleIs this your promise Go to hold your tongueHubert the utterance of a brace of tongues Must needs want pleading for a pair of eyes Let me not hold my tongue let me not Hubert Or Hubert if you will cut out my tongue So I may keep mine eyes O spare mine eyes Though to no use but still to look on you Lo by my troth the instrument is cold And would not harm meI can heat it boyNo in good sooth the fire is dead with grief Being create for comfort to be us'd In undeserved extremes See else yourself There is no malice in this burning coal The breath of heaven hath blown his spirit out And strew'd repentant ashes on his headBut with my breath I can revive it boyAn if you do you will but make it blush And glow with shame of your proceedings Hubert Nay it perchance will sparkle in your eyes And like a dog that is compell'd to fight Snatch at his master that doth tarre him on All things that you should use to do me wrong Deny their office only you do lack That mercy which fierce fire and iron extends Creatures of note for mercylacking usesWell see to live I will not touch thine eye For all the treasure that thine uncle owes Yet I am sworn and I did purpose boy With this same very iron to burn them outO now you look like Hubert All this while You were disguis'dPeace no more Adieu Your uncle must not know but you are dead I'll fill these dogged spies with false reports And pretty child sleep doubtless and secure That Hubert for the wealth of all the world Will not offend theeO heaven I thank you HubertSilence no more Go closely in with me Much danger do I undergo for theeEnglandpalace and other Here once again we sit once again crown'd And look'd upon I hope with cheerful eyesThis once again but that your Highness pleas'd Was once superfluous you were crown'd before And that high royalty was ne'er pluck'd off The faiths of men ne'er stained with revolt Fresh expectation troubled not the land With any long'dfor change or better stateTherefore to be possess'd with double pomp To guard a title that was rich before To gild refined gold to paint the lily To throw a perfume on the violet To smooth the ice or add another hue Unto the rainbow or with taperlight To seek the beauteous eye of heaven to garnish Is wasteful and ridiculous excessBut that your royal pleasure must be done This act is as an ancient tale new told And in the last repeating troublesome Being urged at a time unseasonableIn this the antique and wellnoted face Of plain old form is much disfigured And like a shifted wind unto a sail It makes the course of thoughts to fetch about Startles and frights consideration Makes sound opinion sick and truth suspected For putting on so new a fashion'd robeWhen workmen strive to do better than well They do confound their skill in covetousness And oftentimes excusing of a fault Doth make the fault the worse by th' excuse As patches set upon a little breach Discredit more in hiding of the fault Than did the fault before it was so patch'dTo this effect before you were newcrown'd We breath'd our counsel but it pleas'd your Highness To overbear it and we are all well pleas'd Since all and every part of what we would Doth make a stand at what your Highness willSome reasons of this double coronation I have possess'd you with and think them strong And more more strong when lesser is my fear I shall indue you with Meantime but ask What you would have reform'd that is not well And well shall you perceive how willingly I will both hear and grant you your requestsThen I as one that am the tongue of these To sound the purposes of all their hearts Both for myself and them but chief of all Your safety for the which myself and them Bend their best studies heartily request Th' enfranchisement of Arthur whose restraint Doth move the murmuring lips of discontent To break into this dangerous argument If what in rest you have in right you hold Why then your fearswhich as they say attend The steps of wrongshould move you to mew up Your tender kinsman and to choke his days With barbarous ignorance and deny his youth The rich advantage of good exercise That the time's enemies may not have this To grace occasions let it be our suit That you have bid us ask his liberty Which for our goods we do no further ask Than whereupon our weal on you depending Counts it your weal he have his libertyLet it be so I do commit his youth To your directionAsideHubert what news with youThis is the man should do the bloody deed He show'd his warrant to a friend of mine The image of a wicked heinous fault Lives in his eye that close aspect of his Doth show the mood of a much troubled breast And I do fearfully believe 'tis done What we so fear'd he had a charge to doThe colour of the King doth come and go Between his purpose and his conscience Like heralds 'twixt two dreadful battles set His passion is so ripe it needs must breakAnd when it breaks I fear will issue thence The foul corruption of a sweet child's deathWe cannot hold mortality's strong hand Good lords although my will to give is living The suit which you demand is gone and dead He tells us Arthur is deceas'd tonightIndeed we fear'd his sickness was past cureIndeed we heard how near his death he was Before the child himself felt he was sick This must be answer'd either here or henceWhy do you bend such solemn brows on me Think you I bear the shears of destiny Have I commandment on the pulse of lifeIt is apparent foulplay and 'tis shame That greatness should so grossly offer it So thrive it in your game and so farewellStay yet Lord Salisbury I'll go with thee And find th' inheritance of this poor child His little kingdom of a forced grave That blood which ow'd the breadth of all this isle Three foot of it doth holdbad world the while This must not be thus borne this will break out To all our sorrows and ere long I doubt They burn in indignation I repent There is no sure foundation set on blood No certain life achiev'd by others' death aA fearful eye thou hast where is that blood That I have seen inhabit in those cheeks So foul a sky clears not without a storm Pour down thy weatherhow goes all in FranceFrom France to England Never such a pow'r For any foreign preparation Was levied in the body of a land The copy of your speed is learn'd by them For when you should be told they do prepare The tidings comes that they are all arriv'dO where hath our intelligence been drunk Where hath it slept Where is my mother's care That such an army could be drawn in France And she not hear of itMy liege her ear Is stopp'd with dust the first of April died Your noble mother and as I hear my lord The Lady Constance in a frenzy died Three days before but this from rumour's tongue I idly heardif true or false I know notWithhold thy speed dreadful occasion O make a league with me till I have pleas'd My discontented peers What mother dead How wildly then walks my estate in France Under whose conduct came those pow'rs of France That thou for truth giv'st out are landed hereUnder the DauphinThou hast made me giddy With these in tidings the and Now What says the world To your proceedings Do not seek to stuff My head with more ill news for it is funBut if you be afear'd to hear the worst Then let the worst unheard fall on your headBear with me cousin for I was amaz'd Under the tide but now I breathe again Aloft the flood and can give audience To any tongue speak it of what it willHow I have sped among the clergymen The sums I have collected shall express But as I travell'd hither through the land I find the people strangely fantasied Possess'd with rumours full of idle dreams Not knowing what they fear but full of fear And here's a prophet that I brought with me From forth the streets of Pomfret whom I found With many hundreds treading on his heels To whom he sung in rude harshsounding rhymes That ere the next Ascensionday at noon Your Highness should deliver up your crownThou idle dreamer wherefore didst thou soForeknowing that the truth will fall out soHubert away with him imprison him And on that day at noon whereon he says I shall yield up my crown let him be hang'd Deliver him to safety and return For I must use thee withO my gentle cousin Hear'st thou the news abroad who are arriv'dThe French my lord men's mouths are full of it Besides I met Lord Bigot and Lord Salisbury With eyes as red as newenkindled fire And others more going to seek the grave Of Arthur whom they say is kill'd tonight On your suggestionGentle kinsman go And thrust thyself into their companies I have a way to will their loves again Bring them before meI Will seek them outNay but make haste the better foot before O let me have no subject enemies When adverse foreigners affright my towns With dreadful pomp of stout invasion Be Mercury set feathers to thy heels And fly like thought from them to me againThe spirit of the time shall teach me speedSpoke like a sprightful noble gentlemanGo after him for he perhaps shall need Some messenger betwixt me and the peers And be thou heWith all my heart my liegeMy mother deadRe My lord they say five moons were seen tonight Four fixed and the fifth did whirl about The other four in wondrous motionFive moonsOld men and beldams in the streets Do prophesy upon it dangerously Young Arthur's death is common in their mouths And when they talk of him they shake their heads And whisper one another in the ear And he that speaks doth gripe the hearer's wrist Whilst he that hears makes fearful action With wrinkled brows with nods with rolling eyes I saw a smith stand with his hammer thus The whilst his iron did on the anvil cool With open mouth swallowing a tailor's news Who with his shears and measure in his hand Standing on slippers which his nimble haste Had falsely thrust upon contrary feet Told of a many thousand warlike French That were embattailed and rank'd in Kent Another lean unwash'd artificer Cuts off his tale and talks of Arthur's deathWhy seek'st thou to possess me with these fears Why urgest thou so oft young Arthur's death Thy hand hath murd'red him I had a mighty cause To wish him dead but thou hadst none to kill himNo had my lord Why did you not provoke meIt is the curse of kings to be attended By slaves that take their humours for a warrant To break within the bloody house of life And on the winking of authority To understand a law to know the meaning Of dangerous majesty when perchance it frowns More upon humour than advis'd respectHere is your hand and seal for what I didO when the last account 'twixt heaven and earth Is to be made then shall this hand and seal Witness against us to damnation How oft the sight of means to do ill deeds Make deeds ill done Hadst not thou been by A fellow by the hand of nature mark'd Quoted and sign'd to do a deed of shame This murder had not come into my mind But taking note of thy abhorr'd aspect Finding thee fit for bloody villainy Apt liable to be employ'd in danger I faintly broke with thee of Arthur's death And thou to be endeared to a king Made it no conscience to destroy a princeMy lordHadst thou but shook thy head or made pause When I spake darkly what I purposed Or turn'd an eye of doubt upon my face As bid me tell my tale in express words Deep shame had struck me dumb made me break off And those thy fears might have wrought fears in me But thou didst understand me by my signs And didst in signs again parley with sin Yea without stop didst let thy heart consent And consequently thy rude hand to act The deed which both our tongues held vile to name Out of my sight and never see me more My nobles leave me and my state is braved Even at my gates with ranks of foreign pow'rs Nay in the body of the fleshly land This kingdom this confine of blood and breath Hostility and civil tumult reigns Between my conscience and my cousin's deathArm you against your other enemies I'll make a peace between your soul and you Young Arthur is alive This hand of mine Is yet a maiden and an innocent hand Not painted with the crimson spots of blood Within this bosom never ent'red yet The dreadful motion of a murderous thought And you have slander'd nature in my form Which howsoever rude exteriorly Is yet the cover of a fairer mind Than to be butcher of an innocent childDoth Arthur live O haste thee to the peers Throw this report on their incensed rage And make them tame to their obedience Forgive the comment that my passion made Upon thy feature for my rage was blind And foul imaginary eyes of blood Presented thee more hideous than thou art O answer not but to my closet bring The angry lords with all expedient haste I conjure thee but slowly run more fast England Before the castle on the wallsThe wall is high and yet will I leap down Good ground be pitiful and hurt me not There's few or none do know me if they did This shipboy's semblance hath disguis'd me quite I am afraid and yet I'll venture it If I get down and do not break my limbs I'll find a thousand shifts to get away As good to die and go as die and stayLeaps down O me my uncle's spirit is in these stones Heaven take my soul and England keep my bones Diesand Lords I will meet him at Saint Edmundsbury It is our safety and we must embrace This gentle offer of the perilous timeWho brought that letter from the CardinalThe Count Melun a noble lord of France Whose private with me of the Dauphin's love Is much more general than these lines importTomorrow morning let us meet him thenOr rather then set forward for 'twill be Two long days' journey lords or ere we meet the Once more today well met distemper'd lords The King by me requests your presence straightThe King hath dispossess'd himself of us We will not line his thin bestained cloak With our pure honours nor attend the foot That leaves the print of blood where'er it walks Return and tell him so We know the worstWhate'er you think good words I think were bestOur griefs and not our manners reason nowBut there is little reason in your grief Therefore 'twere reason you had manners nowSir sir impatience hath his privilege'Tis trueto hurt his master no man elseThis is the prison What is he lies hereO death made proud with pure and princely beauty The earth had not a hole to hide this deedMurder as hating what himself hath done Doth lay it open to urge on revengeOr when he doom'd this beauty to a grave Found it too preciousprincely for a graveSir Richard what think you Have you beheld Or have you read or heard or could you think Or do you almost think although you see That you do see Could thought without this object Form such another This is the very top The height the crest or crest unto the crest Of murder's arms this is the bloodiest shame The wildest savagery the vilest stroke That ever walley'd wrath or staring rage Presented to the tears of soft remorseAll murders past do stand excus'd in this And this so sole and so unmatchable Shall give a holiness a purity To the yet unbegotten sin of times And prove a deadly bloodshed but a jest Exampled by this heinous spectacleIt is a damned and a bloody work The graceless action of a heavy hand If that it be the work of any handIf that it be the work of any hand We had a kind of light what would ensue It is the shameful work of Hubert's hand The practice and the purpose of the King From whose obedience I forbid my soul Kneeling before this ruin of sweet life And breathing to his breathless excellence The incense of a vow a holy vow Never to taste the pleasures of the world Never to be infected with delight Nor conversant with ease and idleness Till I have set a glory to this hand By giving it the worship of revengeandOur souls religiously confirm thy words Lords I am hot with haste in seeking you Arthur doth live the King hath sent for youO he is bold and blushes not at death Avaunt thou hateful villain get thee goneI am no villainMust I rob the lawDrawing his swordYour sword is bright sir put it up againNot till I sheathe it in a murderer's skinStand back Lord Salisbury stand back I say By heaven I think my sword's as sharp as yours I would not have you lord forget yourself Nor tempt the danger of my true defence Lest I by marking of your rage forget Your worth your greatness and nobilityOut dunghill Dar'st thou brave a noblemanNot for my life but yet I dare defend My innocent life against an emperorThou art a murdererDo not prove me so Yet I am none Whose tongue soe'er speaks false Not truly speaks who speaks not truly liesCut him to piecesKeep the peace I sayStand by or I shall gall you FaulconbridgeThou wert better gall the devil Salisbury If thou but frown on me or stir thy foot Or teach thy hasty spleen to do me shame I'll strike thee dead Put up thy sword betime Or I'll so maul you and your toastingiron That you shall think the devil is come from hellWhat wilt thou do renowned Faulconbridge Second a villain and a murdererLord Bigot I am noneWho kill'd this prince'Tis not an hour since I left him well I honour'd him I lov'd him and will weep My date of life out for his sweet life's lossTrust not those cunning waters of his eyes For villainy is not without such rheum And he long traded in it makes it seem Like rivers of remorse and innocency Away with me all you whose souls abhor Th' uncleanly savours of a slaughterhouse For I am stifled with this smell of sinAway toward Bury to the Dauphin thereThere tell the King he may inquire us out Here's a good world Knew you of this fair work Beyond the infinite and boundless reach Of mercy if thou didst this deed of death Art thou damn'd HubertDo but hear me sirHa I'll tell thee what Thou'rt damn'd as blacknay nothing is so black Thou art more deep damn'd than Prince Lucifer There is not yet so ugly a fiend of hell As thou shalt be if thou didst kill this childUpon my soulIf thou didst but consent To this most cruel act do but despair And if thou want'st a cord the smallest thread That ever spider twisted from her womb Will serve to strangle thee a rush will be a beam To hang thee on or wouldst thou drown thyself Put but a little water in a spoon And it shall be as all the ocean Enough to stifle such a villain up I do suspect thee very grievouslyIf I in act consent or sin of thought Be guilty of the stealing that sweet breath Which was embounded in this beauteous clay Let hell want pains enough to torture me I left him wellGo bear him in thine arms I am amaz'd methinks and lose my way Among the thorns and dangers of this world How easy dost thou take all England up From forth this morsel of dead royalty The life the right and truth of all this realm Is fled to heaven and England now is left To tug and scamble and to part by th' teeth The unowed interest of proudswelling state Now for the barepick'd bone of majesty Doth dogged war bristle his angry crest And snarleth in the gentle eyes of peace Now powers from home and discontents at home Meet in one line and vast confusion waits As doth a raven on a sickfall'n beast The imminent decay of wrested pomp Now happy he whose cloak and cincture can Hold out this tempest Bear away that child And follow me with speed I'll to the King A thousand businesses are brief in hand And heaven itself doth frown upon the land
