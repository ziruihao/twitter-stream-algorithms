the time Of thy nativity I would the milk Thy mother gave thee when thou suck'dst her breast Had been a little ratsbane for thy sake Or else when thou didst keep my lambs afield I wish some ravenous wolf had eaten thee Dost thou deny thy father cursed drab O burn her burn her Hanging is too good Take her away for she hath liv'd too long To fill the world with vicious qualitiesFirst let me tell you whom you have condemn'd Not me begotten of a shepherd swain But issued from the progeny of kings Virtuous and holy chosen from above By inspiration of celestial grace To work exceeding miracles on earth I never had to do with wicked spirits But you that are polluted with your lusts Stain'd with the guiltless blood of innocents Corrupt and tainted with a thousand vices Because you want the grace that others have You judge it straight a thing impossible To compass wonders but by help of devils No misconceived Joan of Arc hath been A virgin from her tender infancy Chaste and immaculate in very thought Whose maiden blood thus rigorously effus'd Will cry for vengeance at the gates of heavenAy ay Away with her to executionAnd hark ye sirs because she is a maid Spare for no fagots let there be

ye wrought Is all your strict preciseness come to thisShe and the Dauphin have been juggling I did imagine what would be her refugeWell go to we'll have no bastards live Especially since Charles must father itYou are deceiv'd my child is none of his It was Alencon that enjoy'd my loveAlencon that notorious Machiavel It dies an if it had a thousand livesO give me leave I have deluded you 'Twas neither Charles nor yet the Duke I nam'd But Reignier King of Naples that prevail'dA married man That's most intolerableWhy here's a girl I think she knows not well There were so manywhom she may accuseIt's sign she hath been liberal and freeAnd yet forsooth she is a virgin pure Strumpet thy words condemn thy brat and thee Use no entreaty for it is in vainThen lead me hencewith whom I leave my curse May never glorious sun reflex his beams Upon the country where you make abode But darkness and the gloomy shade of death Environ you till mischief and despair Drive you to break your necks or hang yourselves guardedBreak thou in pieces and consume to ashes Thou foul accursed minister of hellattendedLord Regent I do greet your Excellence With letters of commission from the King For know my lords the states of Christendom Mov'd with remorse of these outrageous broils Have earnestly implor'd a general peace Betwixt our nation and the aspiring French And here at hand the Dauphin and his train Approacheth to confer about some matterIs all our travail turn'd to this effect After the slaughter of so many peers So many captains gentlemen and soldiers That in this quarrel have been overthrown And sold their bodies for their country's benefit Shall we at last conclude effeminate peace Have we not lost most part of all the towns By treason falsehood and by treachery Our great progenitors had conquered O Warwick Warwick I foresee with grief The utter loss of all the realm of FranceBe patient York If we conclude a peace It shall be with such strict and severe covenants As little shall the Frenchmen gain therebyand othersSince lords of England it is thus agreed That peaceful truce shall be proclaim'd in France We come to be informed by yourselves What the conditions of that league must beSpeak Winchester for boiling choler chokes The hollow passage of my poison'd voice By sight of these our baleful enemiesCharles and the rest it is enacted thus That in regard King Henry gives consent Of mere compassion and of lenity To ease your country of distressful war An suffer you to breathe in fruitful peace You shall become true liegemen to his crown And Charles upon condition thou wilt swear To pay him tribute and submit thyself Thou shalt be plac'd as viceroy under him And still enjoy thy regal dignityMust he be then as shadow of himself Adorn his temples with a coronet And yet in substance and authority Retain but privilege of a private man This proffer is absurd and reasonless'Tis known already that I am possess'd With more than half the Gallian territories And therein reverenc'd for their lawful king Shall I for lucre of the rest unvanquish'd Detract so much from that prerogative As to be call'd but viceroy of the whole No Lord Ambassador I'll rather keep That which I have than coveting for more Be cast from possibility of allInsulting Charles Hast thou by secret means Us'd intercession to obtain a league And now the matter grows to compromise Stand'st thou aloof upon comparison Either accept the title thou usurp'st Of benefit proceeding from our king And not of any challenge of desert Or we will plague thee with incessant wars To My lord you do not well in obstinacy To cavil in the course of this contract If once it be neglected ten to one We shall not find like opportunity To To say the truth it is your policy To save your subjects from such massacre And ruthless slaughters as are daily seen By our proceeding in hostility And therefore take this compact of a truce Although you break it when your pleasure servesHow say'st thou Charles Shall our condition standIt shall Only reserv'd you claim no interest In any of our towns of garrisonThen swear allegiance to his Majesty As thou art knight never to disobey Nor be rebellious to the crown of England Thou nor thy nobles to the crown of England and the rest give tokens of fealty So now dismiss your army when ye please Hang up your ensigns let your drums be still For here we tain a solemn peace London The palace in conference with the and Your wondrous rare description noble Earl Of beauteous Margaret hath astonish'd me Her virtues graced with external gifts Do breed love's settled passions in my heart And like as rigour of tempestuous gusts Provokes the mightiest hulk against the tide So am I driven by breath of her renown Either to suffer shipwreck or arrive Where I may have fruition of her loveTush my good lord This superficial tale Is but a preface of her worthy praise The chief perfections of that lovely dame Had I sufficient skill to utter them Would make a volume of enticing lines Able to ravish any dull conceit And which is more she is not so divine So fullreplete with choice of all delights But with as humble lowliness of mind She is content to be at your command Command I mean of virtuous intents To love and honour Henry as her lordAnd otherwise will Henry ne'er presume Therefore my Lord Protector give consent That Margaret may be England's royal QueenSo should I give consent to flatter sin You know my lord your Highness is betroth'd Unto another lady of esteem How shall we then dispense with that contract And not deface your honour with reproachAs doth a ruler with unlawful oaths Or one that at a triumph having vow'd To try his strength forsaketh yet the lists By reason of his adversary's odds A poor earl's daughter is unequal odds And therefore may be broke without offenceWhy what I pray is Margaret more than that Her father is no better than an earl Although in glorious titles he excelYes my lord her father is a king The King of Naples and Jerusalem And of such great authority in France As his alliance will confirm our peace And keep the Frenchmen in allegianceAnd so the Earl of Armagnac may do Because he is near kinsman unto CharlesBeside his wealth doth warrant a liberal dower Where Reignier sooner will receive than giveA dow'r my lords Disgrace not so your king That he should be so abject base and poor To choose for wealth and not for perfect love Henry is able to enrich his queen And not to seek a queen to make him rich So worthless peasants bargain for their wives As marketmen for oxen sheep or horse Marriage is a matter of more worth Than to be dealt in by attorneyship Not whom we will but whom his Grace affects Must be companion of his nuptial bed And therefore lords since he affects her most It most of all these reasons bindeth us In our opinions she should be preferr'd For what is wedlock forced but a hell An age of discord and continual strife Whereas the contrary bringeth bliss And is a pattern of celestial peace Whom should we match with Henry being a king But Margaret that is daughter to a king Her peerless feature joined with her birth Approves her fit for none but for a king Her valiant courage and undaunted spirit More than in women commonly is seen Will answer our hope in issue of a king For Henry son unto a conqueror Is likely to beget more conquerors If with a lady of so high resolve As is fair Margaret he be link'd in love Then yield my lords and here conclude with me That Margaret shall be Queen and none but sheWhether it be through force of your report My noble Lord of Suffolk or for that My tender youth was never yet attaint With any passion of inflaming love I cannot tell but this I am assur'd I feel such sharp dissension in my breast Such fierce alarums both of hope and fear As I am sick with working of my thoughts Take therefore shipping post my lord to France Agree to any covenants and procure That Lady Margaret do vouchsafe to come To cross the seas to England and be crown'd King Henry's faithful and anointed queen For your expenses and sufficient charge Among the people gather up a tenth Be gone I say for till you do return I rest perplexed with a thousand cares And you good uncle banish all offence If you do censure me by what you were Not what you are I know it will excuse This sudden execution of my will And so conduct me where from company I may revolve and ruminate my griefAy grief I fear me both at first and lastThus Suffolk hath prevail'd and thus he goes As did the youthful Paris once to Greece With hope to find the like event in love But prosper better than the Troyan did Margaret shall now be Queen and rule the King But I will rule both her the King and realm
