uncle there lies your niece Whose breath indeed these hands have newly stopp'd I know this act shows horrible and grimPoor Desdemon I am glad thy father's dead Thy match was mortal to him and pure grief Shore his old thread in twain did he live now This sight would make him do a desperate turn Yea curse his better angel from his side And fall to reprobation'Tis pitiful but yet Iago knows That she with Cassio hath the act of shame A thousand times committed Cassio confess'd it And she did gratify his amorous works With that recognizance and pledge of love Which I first gave her I saw it in his hand It was a handkerchief an antique token My father gave my motherO heaven O heavenly powers'Zounds Hold your peace'Twill out 'twill I peace No I will speak as liberal as the north Let heaven

villain For 'tis a damned slaveall but Othello and EmiliaI am not valiant neither But every puny whipster gets my sword But why should honor outlive honesty Let it go all What did thy song bode lady Hark canst thou hear me I will play the swan And die in music Sings Willow willow willow Moor she was chaste she loved thee cruel Moor So come my soul to bliss as I speak true So speaking as I think I die I die DiesI have another weapon in this chamber It is a sword of Spain the icebrook's temper O here it is Uncle I must come forthWithin If thou attempt it it will cost thee dear Thou hast no weapon and perforce must sufferLook in upon me then and speak with me Or naked as I am I will assault thee Re GratianoWhat is the matter Behold I have a weapon A better never did itself sustain Upon a soldier's thigh I have seen the day That with this little arm and this good sword I have made my way through more impediments Than twenty times your stop But O vain boast Who can control his fate 'Tis not so now Be not afraid though you do see me weapon'd Here is my journey's end here is my butt And very seamark of my utmost sail Do you go back dismay'd 'Tis a lost fear Man but a rush against Othello's breast And he retires Where should Othello go Now how dost thou look now O illstarr'd wench Pale as thy smock When we shall meet at compt This look of thine will hurl my soul from heaven And fiends will snatch at it Cold cold my girl Even like thy chastity O cursed cursed slave Whip me ye devils From the possession of this heavenly sight Blow me about in winds Roast me in sulphur Wash me in steepdown gulfs of liquid fire O Desdemon dead Desdemon dead O O O Lodovico Montano Cassio carried in a chair and Officers with Iago prisonerWhere is this rash and most unfortunate manThat's he that was Othello Here I amWhere is that viper Bring the villain forthI look down towards his feet but that's a fable If that thou be'st a devil I cannot kill theeWounds IagoWrench his sword from him I bleed sir but not kill'dI am not sorry neither I'ld have thee live For in my sense 'tis happiness to dieO thou Othello that wert once so good Fall'n in the practice of a damned slave What shall be said to thee Why anything An honorable murtherer if you will For nought did I in hate but all in honorThis wretch hath part confess'd his villainy Did you and he consent in Cassio's deathAyDear general I never gave you causeI do believe it and I ask your pardon Will you I pray demand that demidevil Why he hath thus ensnared my soul and bodyDemand me nothing what you know you know From this time forth I never will speak wordWhat not to pray Torments will ope your lipsWell thou dost bestSir you shall understand what hath befall'n Which as I think you know not Here is a letter Found in the pocket of the slain Roderigo And here another The one of them imports The death of Cassio to be undertook By RoderigoO villainMost heathenish and most grossNow here's another discontented paper Found in his pocket too and this it seems Roderigo meant to have sent this damned villain But that belike Iago in the interim Came in and satisfied himO the pernicious caitiff How came you Cassio by that handkerchief That was my wife'sI found it in my chamber And he himself confess'd but even now That there he dropp'd it for a special purpose Which wrought to his desireO fool fool foolThere is besides in Roderigo's letter How he upbraids Iago that he made him Brave me upon the watch whereon it came That I was cast And even but now he spake After long seeming dead Iago hurt him Iago set him onYou must forsake this room and go with us Your power and your command is taken off And Cassio rules in Cyprus For this slave If there be any cunning cruelty That can torment him much and hold him long It shall be his You shall close prisoner rest Till that the nature of your fault be known To the Venetian state Come bring awaySoft you a word or two before you go I have done the state some service and they know't No more of that I pray you in your letters When you shall these unlucky deeds relate Speak of me as I am nothing extenuate Nor set down aught in malice Then must you speak Of one that loved not wisely but too well Of one not easily jealous but being wrought Perplex'd in the extreme of one whose hand Like the base Indian threw a pearl away Richer than all his tribe of one whose subdued eyes Albeit unused to the melting mood Drop tears as fast as the Arabian trees Their medicinal gum Set you down this And say besides that in Aleppo once Where a malignant and a turban'd Turk Beat a Venetian and traduced the state I took by the throat the circumcised dog And smote him thus Stabs himselfO bloody period All that's spoke is marr'dI kiss'd thee ere I kill'd thee No way but this Killing myself to die upon a kiss Falls on the bed and diesThis did I fear but thought he had no weapon For he was great of heartTo Iago O Spartan dog More fell than anguish hunger or the sea Look on the tragic loading of this bed This is thy work The object poisons sight Let it be hid Gratiano keep the house And seize upon the fortunes of the Moor For they succeed on you To you Lord Governor Remains the censure of this hellish villain The time the place the torture O enforce it Myself will straight aboard and to the state This heavy act with heavy heart relate
