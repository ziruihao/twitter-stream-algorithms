But come the bow Now mercy goes to kill And shooting well is then accounted ill Thus will I save my credit in the shoot Not wounding pity would not let me do't If wounding then it was to show my skill That more for praise than purpose meant to kill And out of question so it is sometimes Glory grows guilty of detested crimes When for fame's sake for praise an outward part We bend to that the working of the heart As I for praise alone now seek to spill The poor deer's blood that my heart means no illDo not curst wives hold that selfsovereignty Only for praise sake when they strive to be Lords o'er

know so much by meDescending Now step I forth to whip hypocrisy Ah good my liege I pray thee pardon me Good heart what grace hast thou thus to reprove These worms for loving that art most in love Your eyes do make no coaches in your tears There is no certain princess that appears You'll not be perjur'd 'tis a hateful thing Tush none but minstrels like of sonneting But are you not ashamed Nay are

and of teen O me with what strict patience have I sat To see a king transformed to a gnat To see great Hercules whipping a gig And profound Solomon to tune a jig And Nestor play at pushpin with the boys And critic Timon laugh at idle toys Where lies thy grief O tell me good Dumain And gentle Longaville where lies thy pain And where my liege's All about the breast A caudle hoToo bitter is thy jest Are we betrayed thus to thy overviewNot you by me but I betrayed to you I that am honest I that hold it sin To break the vow I am engaged in I am betrayed by keeping company With men like you men of inconstancy When shall you see me write a thing in rhyme Or groan for Joan or spend a minute's time In pruning me When shall you hear that I Will praise a hand a foot a face an eye A gait a state a

die O dismiss this audience and I shall tell you moreNow the number is evenTrue true we are four Will these turtles be goneHence sirs awayWalk aside the true folk and let the traitors stay Sweet lords sweet lovers O let us embrace As true we are as flesh and blood can be The sea will ebb and flow heaven show his face Young blood doth not obey an old decree We cannot cross the cause why we were born Therefore of all hands must we be forswornWhat did these rent lines show some love of thine'Did they' quoth you Who sees the heavenly Rosaline That like a rude and savage man of Inde At the first op'ning of the gorgeous east Bows not his vassal head and strucken blind Kisses the base ground with obedient breast What peremptory eaglesighted eye Dares look upon the heaven of her brow That is not blinded by her majestyWhat zeal what fury hath inspir'd thee now My love her mistress is a gracious moon She an attending star scarce seen a lightMy eyes are then no eyes nor I Berowne O but for my love day would turn to night Of all complexions the cull'd sovereignty Do meet as at a fair in her fair cheek Where several worthies make one dignity Where nothing wants that want itself doth seek Lend me the flourish of all gentle tongues Fie painted rhetoric O she needs it not To things of sale a seller's praise belongs She passes praise then praise too short doth blot A wither'd hermit fivescore winters worn Might shake off fifty looking in her eye Beauty doth varnish age as if newborn And gives the crutch the cradle's infancy O 'tis the sun that maketh all things shineBy heaven thy love is black as ebonyIs ebony like her O wood divine A wife of such wood were felicity O who can give an oath Where is a book That I may swear beauty doth beauty lack If that she learn not of her eye to look No face is fair that is not full so blackO paradox Black is the badge of hell The hue of dungeons and the school of night And beauty's crest becomes the heavens wellDevils soonest tempt resembling spirits of light O if in black my lady's brows be deckt It mourns that painting and usurping hair Should ravish doters with a false aspect And therefore is she born to make black fair Her favour turns the fashion of the days For native blood is counted painting now And therefore red that would avoid dispraise Paints itself black to imitate her browTo look like her are chimneysweepers blackAnd since her time are colliers counted brightAnd Ethiopes of their sweet complexion crackDark needs no candles now for dark is lightYour mistresses dare never come in rain For fear their colours should be wash'd away'Twere good yours did for sir to tell you plain I'll find a fairer face not wash'd todayI'll prove her fair or talk till doomsday hereNo devil will fright thee then so much as sheI never knew man hold vile stuff so dearLook here's thy love my foot and her face see Showing his shoeO if the streets were paved with thine eyes Her feet were much too dainty for such treadO vile Then as she goes what upward lies The street should see as she walk'd overheadBut what of this Are we not all in loveNothing so sure and thereby all forswornThen leave this chat and good Berowne now prove Our loving lawful and our faith not tornAy marry there some flattery for this evilO some authority how to proceed Some tricks some quillets how to cheat the devilSome salve for perjury'Tis more than need Have at you then affection's menatarms Consider what you first did swear unto To fast to study and to see no woman Flat treason 'gainst the kingly state of youth Say can you fast Your stomachs are too young And abstinence engenders maladies And where that you you have vow'd to study lords In that each of you have forsworn his book Can you still dream and pore and thereon look For when would you my lord or you or you Have found the ground of study's excellence Without the beauty of a woman's face From women's eyes this doctrine I derive They are the ground the books the academes From whence doth spring the true Promethean fire Why universal plodding poisons up The nimble spirits in the arteries As motion and longduring action tires The sinewy vigour of the traveller Now for not looking on a woman's face You have in that forsworn the use of eyes And study too the causer of your vow For where is author in the world Teaches such beauty as a woman's eye Learning is but an adjunct to ourself And where we are our learning likewise is Then when ourselves we see in ladies' eyes With ourselves Do we not likewise see our learning there O we have made a vow to study lords And in that vow we have forsworn our books For when would you my liege or you or you In leaden contemplation have found out Such fiery numbers as the prompting eyes Of beauty's tutors have enrich'd you with Other slow arts entirely keep the brain And therefore finding barren practisers Scarce show a harvest of their heavy toil But love first learned in a lady's eyes Lives not alone immured in the brain But with the motion of all elements Courses as swift as thought in every power And gives to every power a double power Above their functions and their offices It adds a precious seeing to the eye A lover's eyes will gaze an eagle blind A lover's ear will hear the lowest sound When the suspicious head of theft is stopp'd Love's feeling is more soft and sensible Than are the tender horns of cockled snails Love's tongue proves dainty Bacchus gross in taste For valour is not Love a Hercules Still climbing trees in the Hesperides Subtle as Sphinx as sweet and musical As bright Apollo's lute strung with his hair And when Love speaks the voice of all the gods Make heaven drowsy with the harmony Never durst poet touch a pen to write Until his ink were temp'red with Love's sighs O then his lines would ravish savage ears And plant in tyrants mild humility From women's eyes this doctrine I derive They sparkle still the right Promethean fire They are the books the arts the academes That show contain and nourish all the world Else none at all in aught proves excellent Then fools you were these women to forswear Or keeping what is sworn you will prove fools For wisdom's sake a word that all men love Or for Love's sake a word that loves all men Or for men's sake the authors of these women Or women's sake by whom we men are men Let us once lose our oaths to find ourselves Or else we lose ourselves to keep our oaths It is religion to be thus forsworn For charity itself fulfils the law And who can sever love from charitySaint Cupid then and soldiers to the fieldAdvance your standards and upon them lords Pellmell down with them be first advis'd In conflict that you get the sun of themNow to plaindealing lay these glozes by Shall we resolve to woo these girls of FranceAnd win them too therefore let us devise Some tainment for them in their tentsFirst from the park let us conduct them thither Then homeward every man attach the hand Of his fair mistress In the afternoon We will with some strange pastime solace them Such as the shortness of the time can shape For revels dances masks and merry hours Forerun fair Love strewing her way with flowersAway away No time shall be omitted That will betime and may by us be fittedAllons allons Sow'd cockle reap'd no corn And justice always whirls in equal measure Light wenches may prove plagues to men forsworn If so our copper buys no better treasure
