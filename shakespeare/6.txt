oaths He had sworn to marry me When his wife's dead therefore I'll lie with him When I am buried Since Frenchmen are so braid Marry that will I live and die a maid Only in this disguise I think't no sin To cozen him that would unjustly win The Florentine campthe twoand two or three You have not given him his mother's letterI have deliv'red it an hour since There is something in't that stings his nature for on the reading it he chang'd almost into another manHe has much worthy blame laid upon him for shaking off so good a wife and so sweet a ladyEspecially he hath incurred the everlasting displeasure of the King who had even tun'd his bounty to sing happiness to him I will tell you a thing but you shall let it dwell darkly with youWhen you have spoken it 'tis dead and I am the grave of itHe hath perverted a young gentlewoman here in Florence of a most chaste renown and this night he fleshes his will in the spoil of her honour He hath given her his monumental ring and thinks himself made in the unchaste compositionNow God delay our rebellion As we are ourselves what things are weMerely our own traitors And as in the common course of all treasons we still see them reveal themselves till they attain to their abhorr'd ends so he that in this action contrives against his own nobility in his proper stream o'erflows himselfIs it not meant damnable in us to be trumpeters of our unlawful intents We shall not then have his company tonightNot till after midnight for he is dieted to his hourThat approaches apace I would gladly have him see his company anatomiz'd that he might take a measure of his own judgments wherein so curiously he had set this counterfeitWe will not meddle with him till he come for his presence must be the whip of the otherIn the meantime what hear you of these warsI hear there is an overture of peaceNay I assure you a peace concludedWhat will Count Rousillon do then Will he travel higher or return again into FranceI perceive by this demand you are not altogether of his counselLet it be forbid sir So should I be a great deal of his actSir his wife some two months since fled from his house Her pretence is a pilgrimage to Saint Jaques le Grand which holy undertaking with most austere sanctimony she accomplish'd and there residing the tenderness of her nature became as a prey to her grief in fine made a groan of her last breath and now she sings in heavenHow is this justifiedThe stronger part of it by her own letters which makes her story true even to the point of her death Her death itself which could not be her office to say is come was faithfully confirm'd by the rector of the placeHath the Count all this intelligenceAy and the particular confirmations point from point to the full arming of the verityI am heartily sorry that he'll be glad of thisHow mightily sometimes we make us comforts of our lossesAnd how mightily some other times we drown our gain in tears The great dignity that his valour hath here acquir'd for him shall at home be encount'red with a shame as ampleThe web of our life is of a mingled yarn good and ill together Our virtues would be proud if our faults whipt them not and our crimes would despair if they were not cherish'd by our virtuesaHow now Where's your masterHe met the Duke in the street sir of whom he hath taken a solemn leave His lordship will next morning for France The Duke hath offered him letters of commendations to the KingThey shall be no more than needful there if they were more than they can commendThey cannot be too sweet for the King's tartness Here's his lordship now How now my lord is't not after midnightI have tonight dispatch'd sixteen businesses a month's length apiece by an abstract of success I have congied with the Duke done my adieu with his nearest buried a wife mourn'd for her writ to my lady mother I am returning tain'd my convoy and between these main parcels of dispatch effected many nicer needs The last was the greatest but that I

poor gallant knaveNo matter his heels have deserv'd it in usurping his spurs so long How does he carry himselfI have told your lordship already the stocks carry him But to answer you as you would be understood he weeps like a wench that had shed her milk he hath confess'd himself to Morgan whom he supposes to be a friar from the time of his remembrance to this very instant disaster of his setting i' th' stocks And what think you he hath confess'dNothing of me has 'aHis confession is taken and it shall be read to his face if your lordship be in't as I believe you are you must have the patience to hear it guarded and as interpreterA plague upon him muffled He can say nothing of meHush hush Hoodman comes PortotartarossaHe calls for the tortures What will you say without 'emI will confess what

say true 'or thereabouts' set down for I'll speak truthHe's very near the truth in thisBut I con him no thanks for't in the nature he delivers it'Poor rogues' I pray you sayWell that's set downI

reputation with the DukeThe Duke knows him for no other but a poor officer of mine and writ to me this other day to turn him out o' th' band I think I have his letter in my pocketMarry we'll searchIn good sadness I do not know either it is there or it is upon a file with the Duke's other letters in my tentHere 'tis here's a paper Shall I read it to youI do not know if it be it or noOur interpreter does it wellExcellently Reads'Dian the Count's a fool and full of gold'That is not the Duke's letter sir that is an advertisement to a proper maid in Florence one Diana to take heed of the allurement of one Count Rousillon a foolish idle boy but for all that very ruttish I pray you sir put it up againNay I'll read it first by your favourMy meaning in't I protest was very honest in the behalf of the maid for I knew the young Count to be a dangerous and lascivious boy who is a whale to virginity and devours up all the fry it findsDamnable bothsides rogueReads 'When he swears oaths bid him drop gold and take it After he scores he never pays the score Half won is match well made match and well make it He ne'er pays afterdebts take it before And say a soldier Dian told thee this Men are to mell with boys are not to kiss For count of this the Count's a fool I know it Who pays before but not when he does owe it Thine as he vow'd to thee in thine ear'He shall be whipt through the army with

his honestyHe will steal sir an egg out of a cloister for rapes and ravishments he parallels Nessus He professes not keeping of oaths in breaking 'em he is stronger than Hercules He will lie sir with such volubility that you would think truth were a fool Drunkenness is his best virtue for he will be swinedrunk and in his sleep he does little harm save to his bedclothes about him but they know his conditions and lay him in straw I have but little more to say sir of his honesty He has everything that an honest man should not have what an honest man should have he has nothingI begin to love him for thisFor this description of thine honesty A pox upon him For me he's more and more a catWhat say you to his expertness in warFaith sir has led the drum before the English tragediansto belie him I will notand more of his soldiership I know not except in that country he had the honour to be the officer at a place there called Mileend to instruct for the doubling of filesI would do the man what honour I canbut of this I am not certainHe hath outvillain'd villainy so far that the rarity redeems himA pox on him he's a cat stillHis qualities being at this poor price I need not to ask you if gold will corrupt him to revoltSir for a cardecue he will sell the feesimple of his salvation the inheritance of it and cut th' entail from all remainders and a perpetual succession for it perpetuallyWhat's his brother the other Captain DumainWhy does he ask him of meWhat's heE'en a crow o' th' same nest not altogether so great as the first in goodness but greater a great deal in evil He excels his brother for a coward yet his brother is reputed one of the best that is In a retreat he outruns any lackey marry in coming on he has the crampIf your life be saved will you undertake to betray the FlorentineAy and the Captain of his Horse Count RousillonI'll whisper with the General and know his pleasure AsideI'll no more drumming A plague of all drums Only to seem to deserve well and to beguile the supposition of that lascivious young boy the Count have I run into this danger Yet who would have suspected an ambush where I was takenThere is no remedy sir but you must die The General says you that have so traitorously discover'd the secrets of your army and made such pestiferous reports of men very nobly held can serve the world for no honest use therefore you must die
