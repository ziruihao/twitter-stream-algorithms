Britain A hall inpalacein stateand at one door and at another and attendantsNow say what would Augustus Caesar with usWhen Julius Caesar whose remembrance yet Lives in men's eyes and will to ears and tongues Be theme and hearing ever was in this Britain And conquer'd it Cassibelan thine uncle Famous in Caesar's praises no whit less Than in his feats deserving it for him And his succession granted Rome a tribute Yearly three thousand pounds which by thee lately Is left untender'dAnd to kill the marvel Shall be so everThere be many Caesars Ere such another Julius Britain is A world by itself and we will nothing pay For wearing our own nosesThat opportunity Which then they had to take from 's to resume We have again Remember sir my liege The kings your ancestors together with The natural bravery of your isle which stands As Neptune's park ribb'd and pal'd in With rocks unscalable and roaring waters With sands that will not bear your enemies' boats But suck them up to th' topmast A kind of conquest Caesar made here but made not here his brag Of 'came and saw and overcame' With shame The first that ever touch'd him he was carried From off our coast twice beaten and his shipping Poor ignorant baubles on our terrible seas Like eggshells mov'd upon their surges crack'd As easily 'gainst our rocks for joy whereof The fam'd Cassibelan who was once at point O giglot fortune to master Caesar's sword Made Lud's Town with rejoicing fires bright And Britons strut with courageCome there's no more tribute to be paid Our kingdom is stronger than it was at that time and as I said there is no moe such Caesars Other of them may have crook'd noses but to owe such straight arms noneSon let your mother endWe have yet many among us can gripe as hard as Cassibelan I do not say I am one but I have a hand Why tribute Why should we pay tribute If Caesar can hide the sun from us with a blanket or put the moon in his pocket we will pay him tribute for light else sir no more tribute pray you nowYou must know Till the injurious Romans did extort This tribute from us we were free Caesar's ambition Which swell'd so much that it did almost stretch The sides o' th' world against all colour here Did put the yoke upon's which to shake of Becomes a warlike people whom we reckon Ourselves to beWe doSay then to Caesar Our ancestor was that Mulmutius which Ordain'd our laws whose use the sword of Caesar Hath too much mangled whose repair and franchise Shall by the power we hold be our good deed Though Rome be therefore angry Mulmutius made our laws Who was the first of Britain which did put His brows within a golden crown and call'd Himself a kingI am sorry Cymbeline That I am to pronounce Augustus Caesar Caesar that hath moe kings his servants than Thyself domestic officers thine enemy Receive it from me then war and confusion In Caesar's name pronounce I 'gainst thee look For fury not to be resisted Thus defied I thank thee for myselfThou art welcome Caius Thy Caesar knighted me my youth I spent Much under him of him I gather'd honour Which he to seek of me again perforce Behoves me keep at utterance I am perfect That the Pannonians and Dalmatians for Their liberties are now in arms a precedent Which not to read would show the Britons cold So Caesar shall not find themLet proof speakHis majesty bids you welcome Make pastime with us a day or two or longer If you seek us afterwards in other terms you shall find us in our saltwater girdle If you beat us out of it it is yours if you fall in the adventure our crows shall fare the better for you and there's

perceive me like a crow That it is place which lessens and sets off And you may then revolve what tales I have told you Of courts of princes of the tricks in war This service is not service so being

left me bare to weatherUncertain favourMy fault being nothing as I have told you oft But that two villains whose false oaths prevail'd Before my perfect honour swore to Cymbeline I was confederate with the Romans So Follow'd my banishment and this twenty years This rock and these demesnes have been my world Where I have liv'd at honest freedom paid More pious debts to heaven than in all The

He cut our roots in characters And sauc'd our broths as Juno had been sick And he her dieterNobly he yokes A smiling with a sigh as if the sigh Was that it was for not being such a smile The smile mocking the sigh that it would fly From so divine a temple to commix With winds that sailors rail atI do note That grief and patience rooted in him both Mingle their spurs togetherGrow patience And let the stinking elder grief untwine His perishing root with the increasing vineIt is great morning Come away Who's thereI cannot find those runagates that villain Hath mock'd me I am faintThose runagates Means he not us I partly know him 'tis Cloten the son o' th' Queen I fear some ambush I saw him not these many years and yet I know 'tis he We are held as outlaws HenceHe is but one you and my brother search What companies are near Pray you away Let me alone with himSoft What are you That fly me thus Some villain mountaineers I have heard of such What slave art thouA thing More slavish did I ne'er than answering 'A slave' without a knockThou art a robber A lawbreaker a villain Yield thee thiefTo who To thee What art thou Have not I An arm as big as thine a heart as big Thy words I grant are bigger for I wear not My dagger in my mouth Say what thou art Why I should yield to theeThou villain base Know'st me not by my clothesNo nor thy tailor rascal Who is thy grandfather he made those clothes Which as it seems make theeThou precious varlet My tailor made them notHence then and thank The man that gave them thee Thou art some fool I am loath to beat theeThou injurious thief

themDie the death When I have slain thee with my proper hand I'll follow those that even now fled hence And on the gates of Lud's Town set your heads Yield rustic mountaineer fighting Re and No company's abroadNone in the world you did mistake him sureI cannot tell long is it since I saw him But time hath nothing blurr'd those lines of favour Which then he wore the snatches in his voice And burst of speaking were as his I am absolute 'Twas very ClotenIn this place we left them I wish my brother make good time with him You say he is so fellBeing scarce made up I mean to man he had not apprehension Or roaring terrors for defect of judgment Is oft the cease of fear Re withhead But see thy brotherThis Cloten was a fool an empty purse There was no money in't Not Hercules Could have knock'd out his brains for he had none Yet I not doing this the fool had borne My head as I do hisWhat hast thou doneI am perfect what cut off one Cloten's head Son to the Queen after his own report Who call'd me traitor mountaineer and swore With his own single hand he'd take us in Displace our heads where thank the gods they grow And set them on Lud's TownWe are all undoneWhy worthy father what have we to lose But that he swore to take our lives The law Protects not us then why should we be tender To let an arrogant piece of flesh threat us Play judge and executioner all himself For we do fear the law What company Discover you abroadNo single soul Can we set eye on but in an safe reason He must have some attendants Though his humour Was nothing but mutation ay and that From one bad thing to worse not frenzy not Absolute madness could so far have rav'd To bring him here alone Although perhaps It may be heard at court that such as we Cave here hunt here are outlaws and in time May make some stronger head the which he hearing As it is like him might break out and swear He'd fetch us in yet is't not probable To come alone either he so undertaking Or they so suffering Then on good ground we fear If we do fear this body hath a tail More perilous than the headLet ordinance Come as the gods foresay it Howsoe'er My brother hath done wellI had no mind To hunt this day the boy Fidele's sickness Did make my way long forthWith his own sword Which he did wave against my throat I have ta'en His head from him I'll throw't into the creek Behind our rock and let it to the sea And tell the fishes he's the Queen's son Cloten That's all I reckI fear'twill be reveng'd Would Polydore thou hadst not done't though valour Becomes thee well enoughWould I had done't So the revenge alone pursu'd me Polydore I love thee brotherly but envy much Thou hast robb'd me of this deed I would revenges That possible strength might meet would seek us through And put us to our answerWell 'tis done We'll hunt no more today nor seek for danger Where there's no profit I prithee to our rock You and Fidele play the cooks I'll stay Till hasty Polydore return and bring him To dinner presentlyPoor sick Fidele I'll willingly to him to gain his colour I'd let a parish of such Cloten's blood And praise myself for charityO thou goddess Thou divine Nature thou thyself thou blazon'st In these two princely boys They are as gentle As zephyrs blowing below the violet Not wagging his sweet head and yet as rough Their royal blood enchaf'd as the rud'st wind That by the top doth take the mountain pine And make him stoop to th' vale 'Tis wonder That an invisible instinct should frame them To royalty unlearn'd honour untaught Civility not seen from other valour That wildly grows in them but yields a crop As if it had been sow'd Yet still it's strange What Cloten's being here to us portends Or what his death will bring us Re Where's my brother I have sent Cloten's clotpoll down the stream In embassy to his mother his body's hostage For his return Solemn musicMy ingenious instrument Hark Polydore it sounds But what occasion Hath Cadwal now to give it motion HarkIs he at homeHe went hence even nowWhat does he mean Since death of my dear'st mother It did not speak before All solemn things Should answer solemn accidents The matter Triumphs for nothing and lamenting toys Is jollity for apes and grief for boys Is Cadwal madRewith as dead bearingher in his armsLook here he comes And brings the dire occasion in his arms Of what we blame him forThe bird is dead That we have made so much on I had rather Have skipp'd from sixteen years of age to sixty To have turn'd my leaping time into a crutch Than have seen thisO sweetest fairest lily My brother wears thee not the one half so well As when thou grew'st thyselfO melancholy Who ever yet could sound thy bottom find The ooze to show what coast thy sluggish crare Might'st easiliest harbour in Thou blessed thing Jove knows what man thou mightst have made but I Thou diedst a most rare boy of melancholy How found you himStark as you see Thus smiling as some fly had tickled slumber Not as death's dart being laugh'd at his right cheek Reposing on a cushionWhereO' th' floor His arms thus leagu'd I thought he slept and put My clouted brogues from off my feet whose rudeness Answer'd my steps too loudWhy he but sleeps If he be gone he'll make his grave a bed With female fairies will his tomb be haunted And worms will not come to theeWith fairest flowers Whilst summer lasts and I live here Fidele I'll sweeten thy sad grave Thou shalt not lack The flower that's like thy face pale primrose nor The azur'd harebell like thy veins no nor The leaf of eglantine whom not to slander Outsweet'ned not thy breath The ruddock would With charitable bill O bill sore shaming Those richleft heirs that let their fathers lie Without a monument bring thee all this Yea and furr'd moss besides when flow'rs are none To winterground thy corsePrithee have done And do not play in wenchlike words with that Which is so serious Let us bury him And not protract with admiration what Is now due debt To th' graveSay where shall's lay himBy good Euriphile our motherBe't so And let us Polydore though now our voices Have got the mannish crack sing him to th' ground As once to our mother use like note and words Save that Euriphile must be FideleCadwal I cannot sing I'll weep and word it with thee For notes of sorrow out of tune are worse Than priests and fanes that lieWe'll speak it thenGreat griefs I see med'cine the less for Cloten Is quite forgot He was a queen's son boys And though he came our enemy remember He was paid for that Though mean and mighty rotting Together have one dust yet reverence That angel of the world doth make distinction Of place 'tween high and low Our foe was princely And though you took his life as being our foe Yet bury him as a princePray you fetch him hither Thersites' body is as good as Ajax' When neither are aliveIf you'll go fetch him We'll say our song the whilst Brother begin Nay Cadwal we must lay his head to th' East My father hath a reason for't'Tis trueCome on then and remove himSo

flowers but 'bout midnight more The herbs that have on them cold dew o' th' night Are strewings fit'st for graves Upon their faces You were as flow'rs now wither'd Even so These herblets shall which we upon you strew Come on away Apart upon our knees The ground that gave them first has them again Their pleasures here are past so is their pain all but Awaking Yes sir to Milford Haven Which is the way I thank you By yond bush Pray how far thither 'Ods pittikins can it be six mile yet I have gone all night Faith I'll lie down and sleep But soft no bedfellow O gods and goddessesSeeing the body These flow'rs are like the pleasures of the world This bloody man the care on't I hope I dream For so I thought I was a cavekeeper And cook to honest creatures But 'tis not so 'Twas but a bolt of nothing shot at nothing Which the brain makes of fumes Our very eyes Are sometimes like our judgments blind Good faith I tremble still with fear but if there be Yet left in heaven as small a drop of pity As a wren's eye fear'd gods a part of it The dream's here still Even when I wake it is Without me as within me not imagin'd felt A headless man The garments of Posthumus I know the shape of's leg this is his hand His foot Mercurial his Martial thigh The brawns of Hercules but his Jovial face Murder in heaven How 'Tis gone Pisanio All curses madded Hecuba gave the Greeks And mine to boot be darted on thee Thou Conspir'd with that irregulous devil Cloten Hath here cut off my lord To write and read Be henceforth treacherous Damn'd Pisanio Hath with his forged letters damn'd Pisanio From this most bravest vessel of the world Struck the maintop O Posthumus alas Where is thy head Where's that Ay me where's that Pisanio might have kill'd thee at the heart And left this head on How should this be Pisanio 'Tis he and Cloten malice and lucre in them Have laid this woe here O 'tis pregnant pregnant The drug he gave me which he said was precious And cordial to me have I not found it Murd'rous to th' senses That confirms it home This is Pisanio's deed and Cloten O Give colour to my pale cheek with thy blood That we the horrider may seem to those Which chance to find us O my lord

purposeLast night the very gods show'd me a vision I fast and pray'd for their intelligence thus I saw Jove's bird the Roman eagle wing'd From the spongy south to this part of the west There vanish'd in the sunbeams which portends Unless my sins abuse my divination Success to th' Roman hostDream often so And never false Soft ho what trunk is here Without his top The ruin speaks that sometime It was a worthy building How a page Or dead or sleeping on him But dead rather For nature doth abhor to make his bed With the defunct or sleep upon the dead Let's see the boy's faceHe's alive my

falls are means the happier to ariseBritainpalace and attendantsAgain and bring me word how 'tis with her an attendant A fever with the absence of her son A madness of which her life's in danger Heavens How deeply you at once do touch me Imogen The great part of my comfort gone my queen Upon a desperate bed and in a time When fearful wars point at me her son gone So needful for this present It strikes me past The hope of comfort But for thee fellow Who needs must know of her departure and Dost seem so ignorant we'll enforce it from thee By a sharp tortureSir my life is yours I humbly set it at your will but for my mistress I nothing know where she remains why gone Nor when she purposes return Beseech your Highness Hold me your loyal servantGood my liege The day that she was missing he was here I dare be bound he's true and shall perform All parts of his subjection loyally For Cloten There wants no diligence in seeking him And will no doubt be foundThe time is troublesome ToWe'll slip you for a season but our jealousy Does yet dependSo please your Majesty The Roman legions all from Gallia drawn Are landed on your coast with a supply Of Roman gentlemen by the Senate sentNow for the counsel of my son and queen I am amaz'd with matterGood my liege Your preparation can affront no less Than what you hear of Come more for more you're ready The want is but to put those pow'rs in motion That long to moveI thank you Let's withdraw And meet the time as it seeks us We fear not What can from Italy annoy us but We grieve at chances here Away all but I heard no letter from my master since I wrote him Imogen was slain 'Tis strange Nor hear I from my mistress who did promise To yield me often tidings Neither know What is betid to Cloten but remain Perplex'd in all The heavens still must work Wherein I am false I am honest not true to be true These present wars shall find I love my country Even to the note o' th' King or I'll fall in them All other doubts by time let them be clear'd Fortune brings in some boats that are not steer'dWales Before the cave of and The noise is round about usLet us from itWhat pleasure sir find we in life to lock it From action and adventureNay what hope Have we in hiding us This way the Romans Must or for Britons slay us or receive us For barbarous and unnatural revolts During their use and slay us afterSons We'll higher to the mountains there secure us To the King's party there's no going Newness Of Cloten's death we being not known not muster'd Among the bandsmay drive us to a render Where we have liv'd and so extort from's that Which we have done whose answer would be death Drawn on with tortureThis is sir a doubt In such a time nothing becoming you Nor satisfying usIt is not likely That when they hear the Roman horses neigh Behold their quarter'd fires have both their eyes And ears so cloy'd importantly as now That they will waste their time upon our note To know from whence we areO I am known Of many in the army Many years Though Cloten then but young you see not wore him From my remembrance And besides the King Hath not deserv'd my service nor your loves Who find in my exile the want of breeding The certainty of this hard life aye hopeless To have the courtesy your cradle promis'd But to be still hot summer's tanlings and The shrinking slaves of winterThan be so Better to cease to be Pray sir to th' army I and my brother are not known yourself So out of thought and thereto so o'ergrown Cannot be questionedBy this sun that shines I'll thither What thing is't that I never Did see man die scarce ever look'd on blood But that of coward hares hot goats and venison Never bestrid a horse save one that had A rider like myself who ne'er wore rowel Nor iron on his heel I am asham'd To look upon the holy sun to have The benefit of his blest beams remaining So long a poor unknownBy heavens I'll go If you will bless me sir and give me leave I'll take the better care but if you will not The hazard therefore due fall on me by The hands of RomansSo sayAmenNo reason I since of your lives you set So slight a valuation should reserve My crack'd one to more care Have with you boys If in your country wars you chance to die That is my bed too lads and there I'll lie Lead lead Aside The time seems long their blood thinks scorn Till it fly out and show them princes born
