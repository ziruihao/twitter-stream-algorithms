voluntary dotage of some mistress Convinced or supplied them cannot choose But they must blab Hath he said anythingHe hath my lord but be you well assured No more than he'll unswear What hath he saidFaith that he did I know not what he didWhat whatLieWith her With her on her what you willLie with her lie on her We say lie on her when they belie her Lie with her 'Zounds that's fulsome

back Lay not your blame on me If you have lost him Why I have lost him too Had it pleased heaven To try me with affliction had they rain'd All kinds of sores and shames on my bare head Steep'd me in poverty to the very lips Given to captivity me and my utmost hopes I should have found in some place of my soul A drop of patience but alas to make me A fixed figure for the time of scorn To point his slow unmoving finger at Yet could I bear that too well very well But there where I have garner'd up my heart Where either I must live or bear no life The fountain from the which my current runs Or else dries up to be discarded thence Or keep it as a cistern for foul toads To knot and gender in Turn thy complexion there Patience thou young and roselipp'd cherubin Ay there look grim as hellI hope

of my cheeks That would to cinders burn up modesty Did I but speak thy deeds What committed Heaven stops the nose at it and the moon winks The bawdy wind that kisses all it meets Is hush'd within the hollow mine of earth And will not hear it What committed Impudent strumpetBy heaven you do me wrongAre not you a strumpetNo as I am a Christian If to preserve this vessel for my lord From any other foul unlawful touch Be not to be a strumpet I am noneWhat not a whore No as I shall be savedIs't possibleO heaven forgive usI cry you mercy then I took you for that cunning whore of Venice That married with Othello Raises his voice You mistress That have the office opposite to Saint Peter And keep the gate of hellRe EmiliaYou you ay you We have done our course there's money for your pains I

with IagoWhat is your pleasure madam How is't with youI cannot tell Those that do teach young babes Do it with gentle means and easy tasks He might have chid me so for in good faith I am a child to chiding What's the matter ladyAlas Iago my lord hath so bewhored her Thrown such despite and heavy terms upon her As true hearts cannot bearAm I that name Iago What name fair ladySuch as she says my lord did say I wasHe call'd her whore a beggar in his drink Could not have laid such terms upon his calletWhy did he soI do not know I am sure I am none suchDo not weep do not weep Alas the dayHath she forsook so many noble matches Her father and her country and her friends To be call'd whore Would it not make one weepIt is my wretched fortuneBeshrew him for't How comes this trick upon himNay

such man it is impossibleIf any such there be heaven pardon himA halter pardon him And hell gnaw his bones Why should he call her whore Who keeps her company What place What time What form What

rascals naked through the world Even from the east to the westSpeak within doorO fie upon them Some such squire he was That turn'd your wit the seamy side without And made you to suspect me with the MoorYou are a fool go toO good Iago What shall I do to win my lord again Good friend go to him for by this light of heaven I know not how I lost him Here I kneel If e'er my will did trespass 'gainst his love Either in discourse of thought or actual deed Or that mine eyes mine ears or any sense Delighted them in any other form Or that I do not yet and ever did And ever will though he do shake me off To beggarly divorcement love him dearly Comfort forswear me Unkindness may do much And his unkindness may defeat my life But never taint my love I cannot say whore It doth abhor me now I speak the word To do the act that might the addition earn Not the world's mass of vanity could make meI pray you be content 'tis but his humor The business of the state does him offense And he does chide with youIf 'twere no other'Tis but so I warrantTrumpets within Hark how these instruments summon to supper The messengers of Venice stay the meat Go in and weep not all things shall be well Desdemona and Emilia Roderigo How now RoderigoI do not find that thou dealest justly with meWhat in the contraryEvery day thou daffest me with some device Iago and rather as it seems to me now keepest from me all conveniency than suppliest me with the least advantage of hope I will indeed no longer endure it nor am I yet persuaded to put up in peace what already I have foolishly sufferedWill you hear me RoderigoFaith I have heard too much for your words and performances are no kin togetherYou charge me most unjustlyWith nought but truth I have wasted myself out of my means The jewels you have had from me to deliver to Desdemona would half have corrupted a votarist You have told me she hath received them and returned me expectations and comforts of sudden respect and acquaintance but I find noneWell go to very wellVery well go to I cannot go to man nor 'tis not very well By this hand I say 'tis very scurvy and begin to find myself fopped in itVery wellI tell you 'tis not very well I will make myself known to Desdemona If she will return me my jewels I will give over my suit and repent my unlawful solicitation if not assure yourself I will seek satisfaction of youYou have said nowAy and said nothing but what I protest intendment of doingWhy now I see there's mettle in thee and even from this instant do build on thee a better opinion than ever before Give me thy hand Roderigo Thou hast taken against me a most just exception but yet I protest have dealt most directly in thy affairIt hath not appearedI grant indeed it hath not appeared and your suspicion is not without wit and judgement But Roderigo if thou hast that in thee indeed which I have greater reason to believe now than ever I mean purpose courage and valor this night show it if thou the next night following enjoy not Desdemona take me from this world with treachery and devise engines for my lifeWell what is it Is it within reason and compassSir there is especial commission come from Venice to depute Cassio in Othello's placeIs that true Why then Othello and Desdemona return again to VeniceO no he goes into Mauritania and takes away with him the fair Desdemona unless his abode be lingered here by some accident wherein none can be so determinate as the removing of CassioHow do you mean removing of himWhy by making him uncapable of Othello's place knocking out his brainsAnd that you would have me to doAy if you dare do yourself a profit and a right He sups tonight with a harlotry and thither will I go to him He knows not yet of his honorable fortune If you will watch his going thence which his will fashion to fall out between twelve and one you may take him at your pleasure I will be near to second your attempt and he shall fall between us Come stand not amazed at it but go along with me I will show you such a necessity in his death that you shall think yourself bound to put it on him It is now high suppertime and the night grows to waste About itI will hear further reason for thisAnd you shall be satisfied Another room in the castleOthello Lodovico Desdemona Emilia and AttendantsI do beseech you sir trouble yourself no furtherO pardon me 'twill do me good to walkMadam good night I humbly thank your ladyshipYour honor is most welcomeWill you walk sir O DesdemonaMy lordGet you to bed on the instant I will be returned forthwith Dismiss your attendant there look it be doneI will my lordOthello Lodovico and AttendantsHow goes it now He looks gentler than he didHe says he will return incontinent He hath commanded me to go to bed And bade me to dismiss youDismiss meIt was his bidding therefore good Emilia Give me my nightly wearing and adieu We must not now displease himI would you had never seen himSo would notMy love doth so approve him That even his stubbornness his checks his frowns Prithee unpin me have grace and favor in themI have laid those sheets you bade me on the bedAll's one Good faith how foolish are our minds If I do die before thee prithee shroud me In one of those same sheets Come come you talkMy mother had a maid call'd Barbary She was in love and he she loved proved mad And did forsake her She had a song of willow An old thing 'twas but it express'd her fortune And she died singing it That song tonight Will not go from my mind I have much to do But to go hang my head all at one side And sing it like poor Barbary Prithee dispatchShall I go fetch your nightgownNo unpin me here This Lodovico is a proper manA very handsome manHe speaks wellI know a lady in Venice would have walked barefoot to Palestine for a touch of his nether lipSings The poor soul sat sighing by a sycamore tree Sing all a green willow Her hand on her bosom her head on her knee Sing willow willow willow The fresh streams ran by her and murmur'd her moans Sing willow willow willow Her salt tears fell from her and soften'd the stones Lay be these Sings Sing willow willow willow Prithee hie thee he'll come anon Sings Sing all a green willow must be my garlandLet nobody blame him his scorn I approve Nay that's not next Hark who is't that knocksIt's the windSings I call'd my love false love but what said he then Sing willow willow willow If I court moe women you'll couch with moe men So get thee gone good night Mine eyes do itch Doth that bode weeping'Tis neither here nor thereI have heard it said so O these men these men Dost thou in conscience think tell me Emilia That there be women do abuse their husbands In such gross kindThere be some such no questionWouldst thou do such a deed for all the worldWhy would not you No by this heavenly lightNor I neither by this heavenly light I might do't as well i' the darkWouldst thou do such a deed for all the worldThe world's a huge thing it is a great price For a small vice In troth I think thou wouldst notIn troth I think I should and undo't when I had done Marry I would not do such a thing for a jointring nor for measures of lawn nor for gowns petticoats nor caps nor any petty exhibition but for the whole world why who would not make her husband a cuckold to make him a monarch I should venture purgatory for'tBeshrew me if I would do such a wrong For the whole worldWhy the wrong is but a wrong i' the world and having the world for your labor 'tis a wrong in your own world and you might quickly make it rightI do not think there is any such womanYes a dozen and as many to the vantage as would store the world they played for But I do think it is their husbands' faults If wives do fall say that they slack their duties And pour our treasures into foreign laps Or else break out in peevish jealousies Throwing restraint upon us or say they strike us Or scant our former having in despite Why we have galls and though we have some grace Yet have we some revenge Let husbands know Their wives have sense like them they see and smell And have their palates both for sweet and sour As husbands have What is it that they do When they change us for others Is it sport I think it is And doth affection breed it I think it doth Is't frailty that thus errs It is so too And have not we affections Desires for sport and frailty as men have Then let them use us well else let them know The ills we do their ills instruct us soGood night good night Heaven me such uses send Not to pick bad from bad but by bad mend
