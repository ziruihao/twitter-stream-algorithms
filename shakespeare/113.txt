Inverness Court of Macbeth's castleBanquo and Fleance bearing a torch before himHow goes the night boyThe moon is down I have not heard the clockAnd she goes down at twelveI take't 'tis later sirHold take my sword There's husbandry in heaven Their candles are all out Take thee that too A heavy summons lies like lead upon me And yet I would not sleep Merciful powers Restrain in me the cursed thoughts that nature Gives way to in repose Macbeth and a Servant with a torch Give me my sword Who's thereA friendWhat sir not yet at rest The King's abed He hath been in unusual pleasure and Sent forth great largess to your offices This diamond he greets your wife withal By the name of most kind hostess and shut up In measureless contentBeing unprepared Our will became the servant to defect Which else should free have wroughtAll's well I dreamt last night of the three weird sisters To you they have show'd some truthI think not of them Yet when we can entreat an hour to serve We would spend it in some words upon that business If you would grant the timeAt your kind'st leisureIf you shall cleave to my consent when 'tis It shall make honor for youSo I lose none In seeking to augment it but still keep My bosom franchised and allegiance clear I shall be counsel'dGood repose the whileThanks sir the like to you Banquo and FleanceGo bid thy mistress when my drink is ready She strike upon the bell Get thee to bedServant Is this a dagger which I see before me The handle toward my hand Come let me clutch thee I have thee not and yet I see thee still Art thou not fatal vision sensible To feeling as to sight Or art thou but A dagger of the mind a false creation Proceeding from the heatoppressed brain I see thee yet in form as palpable As this which now I draw Thou marshal'st me the way that I was going And such an instrument I was to use Mine eyes are made the fools o' the other senses Or else worth all the rest I see thee still And on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood Which was not so before There's no such thing It is the bloody business which informs Thus to mine eyes Now o'er the one halfworld Nature seems dead and wicked dreams abuse The curtain'd sleep witchcraft celebrates Pale Hecate's offerings and wither'd Murther Alarum'd by his sentinel the wolf Whose howl's his watch thus with his stealthy pace With Tarquin's ravishing strides towards his design Moves like a ghost Thou sure and firmset earth Hear not my steps which way they walk for fear Thy very stones prate of my whereabout And take the present horror from the time Which now suits with it Whiles I threat he lives Words to the heat of deeds too cold breath givesA bell rings I go and it is done the bell invites me Hear it not Duncan for it is a knell That summons thee to heaven or to hell The sameLady MacbethThat which hath made them drunk hath made me bold What hath quench'd them hath given me fire Hark Peace It was the owl that shriek'd the fatal bellman Which gives the stern'st good night He is about it The doors are open and the surfeited grooms Do mock their charge with snores I have drugg'd their possets That death and nature do contend about them Whether they live or dieWithin Who's there' what hoAlack I am afraid they have awaked And 'tis not done The attempt and not the deed Confounds us Hark I laid their daggers ready He could not miss 'em Had he not resembled My father as he slept I had done'tMacbeth My husbandI have done the deed Didst thou not hear a noiseI heard the owl scream and the crickets cry Did not you speakWhenNowAs I descendedAyHark Who lies i' the second chamberDonalbainThis is a sorry sight Looks on his handsA foolish thought to say a sorry sightThere's one did laugh in 's sleep and one cried Murther That they did wake each other I stood and heard them But they did say their prayers and address'd them Again to sleepThere are two lodged togetherOne cried God bless us and Amen the other As they had seen me with these hangman's hands Listening their fear I could not say Amen When they did say God bless usConsider it not so deeplyBut wherefore could not I pronounce Amen I had most need of blessing and Amen Stuck in my throatThese deeds must not be thought After these ways so it will make us madI heard a voice cry Sleep no more Macbeth does murther sleep the innocent sleep Sleep that knits up the ravel'd sleave of care The death of each day's life sore labor's bath Balm of hurt minds great nature's second course Chief nourisher in life's feastWhat do you meanStill it cried Sleep no more to all the house Glamis hath murther'd sleep and therefore Cawdor Shall sleep no more Macbeth shall sleep no moreWho was it that thus cried Why worthy Thane You do unbend your noble strength to think So brainsickly of things Go get some water And wash this filthy witness from your hand Why did you bring these daggers from the place They must lie there Go carry them and smear The sleepy grooms with bloodI'll go no more I am afraid to think what I have done Look on't again I dare notInfirm of purpose Give me the daggers The sleeping and the dead Are but as pictures 'tis the eye of childhood That fears a painted devil If he do bleed I'll gild the faces of the grooms withal For it must seem their guiltKnocking withinWhence is that knocking How is't with me when every noise appals me What hands are here Ha they pluck out mine eyes Will all great Neptune's ocean wash this blood Clean from my hand No this my hand will rather The multitudinous seas incarnadine Making the green one redRe Lady MacbethMy hands are of your color but I shame To wear a heart so white Knocking within I hear knocking At the south entry Retire we to our chamber A little water clears us of this deed How easy is it then Your constancy Hath left you unattended Knocking within Hark more knocking Get on your nightgown lest occasion call us And show us to be watchers Be not lost So poorly in your thoughtsTo know my deed 'twere best not know myself Knocking within Wake Duncan with thy knocking I would thou couldstThe samea Porter Knocking withinHere's a knocking indeed If a man were porter of Hell Gate he should have old turning the key Knocking within Knock knock knock Who's there i' the name of Belzebub Here's a farmer that hanged himself on th' expectation of plenty Come in time Have napkins enow about you here you'll sweat fort Knocking within Knock knock Who's there in th' other devil's name Faith here's an equivocator that could swear in both the scales against either scale who committed treason enough for God's sake yet could not equivocate to heaven O come in equivocator Knocking within Knock knock knock Who's there Faith here's an English tailor come hither for stealing out of a French hose Come in tailor here you may roast your goose Knocking within Knock knock Never at quiet What are you But this place is too cold for hell I'll devilporter it no further I had thought to have let in some of all professions that go the primrose way to the everlasting bonfire Knocking within Anon anon I pray you remember the porterOpens the gate Macduff and LennoxWas it so late friend ere you went to bed That you do lie so lateFaith sir we were carousing till the second cock and drink sir is a great provoker of three thingsWhat three things does drink especially provokeMarry sir nosepainting sleep and urine Lechery sir it provokes and unprovokes it provokes the desire but it takes away the performance Therefore much drink may be said to be an equivocator with lechery it makes him and it mars him it sets him on and it takes him off it persuades him and disheartens him makes him stand to and not stand to in conclusion equivocates him in a sleep and giving him the lie leaves himI believe drink gave thee the lie last nightThat it did sir i' the very throat on me but requited him for his lie and I think being too strong for him though he took up my legs sometime yet I made shift to cast himIs thy master stirring Macbeth Our knocking has awaked him here he comesGood morrow noble sirmorrow bothIs the King stirring worthy ThaneNot yetHe did command me to call timely on him I have almost slipp'd the hourI'll bring you to himI know this is a joyful trouble to you But yet 'tis oneThe labor we delight in physics pain This is the door I'll make so bold to call For 'tis my limited service Goes the King hence todayHe does he did appoint soThe night has been unruly Where we lay Our chimneys were blown down and as they say Lamentings heard i' the air strange screams of death And prophesying with accents terrible Of dire combustion and confused events New hatch'd to the woeful time The obscure bird Clamor'd the livelong night Some say the earth Was feverous and did shake'Twas a rough fightMy young remembrance cannot parallel A fellow to it Re MacduffO horror horror horror Tongue nor heart Cannot conceive nor name thee What's the matterConfusion now hath made his masterpiece Most sacrilegious murther hath broke ope The Lord's anointed temple and stole thence The life o' the buildingWhat is't you say the lifeMean you his MajestyApproach the chamber and destroy your sight With a new Gorgon Do not bid me speak See and then speak yourselvesMacbeth and Lennox Awake awake Ring the alarum bell Murther and treason Banquo and Donalbain Malcolm awake Shake off this downy sleep death's counterfeit And look on death itself Up up and see The great doom's image Malcolm Banquo As from your graves rise up and walk like sprites To countenance this horror Ring the bell Bell rings Lady MacbethWhat's the business That such a hideous trumpet calls to parley The sleepers of the house Speak speakO gentle lady 'Tis not for you to hear what I can speak The repetition in a woman's ear Would murther as it fell Banquo O Banquo Banquo Our royal master's murther'dWoe alas What in our houseToo cruel anywhere Dear Duff I prithee contradict thyself And say it is not so Re Macbeth and Lennox with RossHad I but died an hour before this chance I had lived a blessed time for from this instant There's nothing serious in mortality All is but toys renown and grace is dead The wine of life is drawn and the mere lees Is left this vault to brag ofMalcolm and DonalbainWhat is amissYou are and do not know't The spring the head the fountain of your blood Is stopped the very source of it is stopp'dYour royal father's murther'd O by whomThose of his chamber as it seem'd had done't Their hands and faces were all badged with blood So were their daggers which unwiped we found Upon their pillows They stared and were distracted no man's life Was to be trusted with themO yet I do repent me of my fury That I did kill themWherefore did you soWho can be wise amazed temperate and furious Loyal and neutral in a moment No man The expedition of my violent love Outrun the pauser reason Here lay Duncan His silver skin laced with his golden blood And his gash'd stabs look'd like a breach in nature For ruin's wasteful entrance there the murtherers Steep'd in the colors of their trade their daggers Unmannerly breech'd with gore Who could refrain That had a heart to love and in that heart Courage to make 's love knownHelp me hence hoLook to the ladyAside to Donalbain Why do we hold our tongues That most may claim this argument for oursAside to Malcolm What should be spoken here where our fate Hid in an auger hole may rush and seize us Let's away Our tears are not yet brew'dAside to Donalbain Nor our strong sorrow Upon the foot of motionLook to the lady Lady Macbeth is carried out And when we have our naked frailties hid That suffer in exposure let us meet And question this most bloody piece of work To know it further Fears and scruples shake us In the great hand of God I stand and thence Against the undivulged pretense I fight Of treasonous maliceAnd so do So allLet's briefly put on manly readiness And meet i' the hall togetherWell contented all but Malcolm and DonalbainWhat will you do Let's not consort with them To show an unfelt sorrow is an office Which the false man does easy I'll to EnglandTo Ireland I our separated fortune Shall keep us both the safer Where we are There's daggers in men's smiles the near in blood The nearer bloodyThis murtherous shaft that's shot Hath not yet lighted and our safest way Is to avoid the aim Therefore to horse And let us not be dainty of leavetaking But shift away There's warrant in that theft Which steals itself when there's no mercy leftOutside Macbeth's castleRoss with an Old ManThreescore and ten I can remember well Within the volume of which time I have seen Hours dreadful and things strange but this sore night Hath trifled former knowingsAh good father Thou seest the heavens as troubled with man's act Threaten his bloody stage By the clock 'tis day And yet dark night strangles the traveling lamp Is't night's predominance or the day's shame That darkness does the face of earth entomb When living light should kiss it'Tis unnatural Even like the deed that's done On Tuesday last A falcon towering in her pride of place Was by a mousing owl hawk'd at and kill'dAnd Duncan's horsesa thing most strange and certain Beauteous and swift the minions of their race Turn'd wild in nature broke their stalls flung out Contending 'gainst obedience as they would make War with mankind'Tis said they eat each otherThey did so to the amazement of mine eyes That look'd upon't Macduff Here comes the good Macduff How goes the world sir nowWhy see you notIs't known who did this more than bloody deedThose that Macbeth hath slainAlas the day What good could they pretendThey were suborn'd Malcolm and Donalbain the King's two sons Are stol'n away and fled which puts upon them Suspicion of the deed'Gainst nature still Thriftless ambition that wilt ravin up Thine own life's means Then 'tis most like The sovereignty will fall upon MacbethHe is already named and gone to Scone To be investedWhere is
