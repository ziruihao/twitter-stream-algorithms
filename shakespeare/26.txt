Rome Before a gate of the city with the young of RomeCome leave your tears a brief farewell The beast With many heads butts me away Nay mother Where is your ancient courage You were us'd To say

com'st thou What wouldst thou Thy name Why speak'st not Speak man What's thy name UnmufflingIf Tullus Not yet thou know'st me and seeing me dost not Think me for the man I am necessity Commands me name myselfWhat is thy nameA name unmusical to the Volscians' ears And harsh in sound to thineSay what's thy name Thou has a grim appearance and thy face Bears a command in't though thy tackle's torn Thou show'st a noble vessel What's thy namePrepare thy brow to frown know'st thou me yetI know thee not Thy nameMy name is Caius Marcius who hath done To thee particularly and to all the Volsces Great hurt and mischief thereto witness may My surname Coriolanus The painful service The extreme dangers and the drops of blood Shed for my thankless country are requited But with that surname a good memory And witness of the malice and displeasure Which thou shouldst bear me Only that name remains The cruelty and envy of the people Permitted by our dastard nobles who Have all forsook me hath devour'd the rest An suffer'd me by th' voice of slaves to be Whoop'd out of Rome Now this extremity Hath brought me to thy hearth not out of hope Mistake me not to save my life for if I had fear'd death of all the men i' th' world I would have 'voided thee but in mere spite To be full quit of those my banishers Stand I before thee here Then if thou hast A heart of wreak in thee that wilt revenge Thine own particular wrongs and stop those maims Of shame seen through thy country speed thee straight And make my misery serve thy turn So use it That my revengeful services may prove As benefits to thee for I will fight Against my cank'red country with the spleen Of all the under fiends But if so be Thou dar'st not this and that to prove more fortunes Th'art tir'd then in a word I also am Longer to live most weary and present My throat to thee and to thy ancient malice Which not to cut would show thee but a fool Since I have ever followed thee with hate Drawn tuns of blood out of thy country's breast And cannot live but to thy shame unless It be to do thee serviceO Marcius Marcius Each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart A root of ancient envy If Jupiter Should from yond cloud speak divine things And say ''Tis true' I'd not believe them more Than thee all noble Marcius Let me twine Mine arms about that body where against My grained ash an hundred times hath broke And scarr'd the moon with splinters here I clip The anvil of my sword and do contest As hotly and as nobly with thy love As ever in ambitious strength I did Contend against thy valour Know thou first I lov'd the maid I married never man Sigh'd truer breath but that I see thee here Thou noble thing more dances my rapt heart Than when I first my wedded mistress saw Bestride my threshold Why thou Mars I tell the We have a power on foot and I had purpose Once more to hew thy target from thy brawn Or lose mine arm for't Thou hast beat me out Twelve several times and I have nightly since Dreamt of encounters 'twixt thyself and me We have been down together in my sleep Unbuckling helms fisting each other's throat And wak'd half dead with nothing Worthy Marcius Had we no other quarrel else to Rome but that Thou art thence banish'd we would muster all From twelve to seventy and pouring war Into the bowels of ungrateful Rome Like a bold flood o'erbeat O come go in And take our friendly senators by th' hands Who now are here taking their leaves of me Who am prepar'd against your territories Though not for Rome itselfYou bless me godsTherefore most absolute sir if thou wilt have The leading of thine own revenges take Th' one half of my commission and set down As best thou art experienc'd since thou know'st Thy country's strength and weakness thine own ways Whether to knock against the gates of Rome Or rudely visit them in parts remote To fright them ere destroy But come in Let me commend thee first to those that shall Say yea to thy desires A thousand welcomes And more a friend than e'er an enemy Yet Marcius that was much Your hand most welcome The two come forwardHere's a strange alterationBy my hand I had thought to have strucken him with a cudgel and yet my mind gave me his clothes made a false report of himWhat an arm he has He turn'd me about with his finger and his thumb as one would set up a topNay I knew by his face that there was something in him he had sir a kind of face methought I cannot tell how to term itHe had so looking as it were Would I were hang'd but I thought there was more in him than I could thinkSo did I I'll be sworn He is simply the rarest man i' th' worldI think he is but a greater soldier than he you wot onWho my masterNay it's no matter for thatWorth six on himNay not so neither but I take him to be the greater soldierFaith look you one cannot tell how to say that for the defence of a town our general is excellentAy and for an assault tooRe the third O slaves I can tell you news news you rascalsWhat what what Let's partakeI would not be a Roman of all nations I had as lief be a condemn'd manWherefore whereforeWhy here's he that was wont to thwack our general Caius MarciusWhy do you say 'thwack our general'I do not say 'thwack our general' but he was always good enough for himCome we are fellows and friends He was ever too hard for him I have heard him say so himselfHe was too hard for him directly to say the troth on't before Corioli he scotch'd him and notch'd him like a carbonadoAn he had been cannibally given he might have broil'd and eaten him tooBut more of thy newsWhy he is so made on here within as if he were son and heir to Mars set at upper end o' th' table no question asked him by any of the senators but they stand bald before him Our general himself makes a mistress of him sanctifies himself with's hand and turns up the white o' th' eye to his discourse But the bottom of the news is our general is cut i' th' middle and but one half of what he was yesterday for the other has half by the entreaty and grant of the whole table He'll go he says and sowl the porter of Rome gates by th' ears he will mow all down before him and leave his passage poll'dAnd he's as like to do't as any man I can imagineDo't He will do't for look you sir he has as many friends as enemies which friends sir as it were durst not look you sir show themselves as we term it his friends whilst he's in directitudeDirectitude What's thatBut when they shall see sir his crest up again and the man in blood they will out of their burrows like conies after rain and revel an with himBut when goes this forwardTomorrow today presently You shall have the drum struck up this afternoon 'tis as it were parcel of their feast and to be executed ere they wipe their lipsWhy then we shall have a stirring world again This peace is nothing but to rust iron increase tailors and breed balladmakersLet me have war say I it exceeds peace as far as day does night it's spritely waking audible and full of vent Peace is a very apoplexy lethargy mull'd deaf sleepy insensible a getter of more bastard children than war's a destroyer of men'Tis so and as war in some sort may be said to be a ravisher so it cannot be denied but peace is a great maker of cuckoldsAy and it makes men hate one anotherReason because they then less need one another The wars for my money I hope to see Romans as cheap as Volscians They are rising they are risingIn in in in Rome A public placethe two Tribunes and We hear not of him neither need we fear him His remedies are tame The present peace And quietness of the people which before Were in wild hurry here do make his friends Blush that the world goes well who rather had Though they themselves did suffer by't behold Dissentious numbers pest'ring streets than see Our tradesmen singing in their shops and going About their functions friendlyWe stood to't in good time Is this Menenius'Tis he 'tis he O he is grown most kind Of late Hail sirHail to you bothYour Coriolanus is not much miss'd But with his friends The commonwealth doth stand And so would do were he more angry at itAll's well and might have been much better He could have temporiz'dWhere is he hear youNay I hear nothing his mother and his wife Hear nothing from him three or four citizensThe gods preserve you bothGodden our neighboursGodden to you all godden to you anOurselves our wives and children on our knees Are bound to pray for you bothLive and thriveFarewell kind neighbours we wish'd Coriolanus Had lov'd you as we didNow the gods keep youFarewell farewellcitizensThis is a happier and more comely time Than when these fellows ran about the streets Crying confusionCaius Marcius was A worthy officer i' the war but insolent O'ercome with pride ambitious past all thinking SelflovingAnd affecting one sole throne Without assistanceI think not soWe should by this to all our lamentation If he had gone forth consul found it soThe gods have well prevented it and Rome Sits safe and still without him an Worthy tribunes There is a slave whom we have put in prison Reports the Volsces with several powers Are ent'red in the Roman territories And with the deepest malice of the war Destroy what lies before 'em'Tis Aufidius Who hearing of our Marcius' banishment Thrusts forth his horns again into the world Which were inshell'd when Marcius stood for Rome And durst not once peep outCome what talk you of MarciusGo see this rumourer whipp'd It cannot be The Volsces dare break with usCannot be We have record that very well it can And three examples of the like hath been Within my age But reason with the fellow Before you punish him where he heard this Lest you shall chance to whip your information And beat the messenger who bids beware Of what is to be dreadedTell not me I know this cannot beNot Possible A The nobles in great earnestness are going All to the Senate House some news is come That turns their countenances'Tis this slave Go whip him fore the people's eyes his raising Nothing but his reportYes worthy sir The slave's report is seconded and more More fearful is deliver'dWhat more fearfulIt is spoke freely out of many mouths How probable I do not know that Marcius Join'd with Aufidius leads a power 'gainst Rome And vows revenge as spacious as between The young'st and oldest thingThis is most likelyRais'd only that the weaker sort may wish Good Marcius home againThe very trick on 'tThis is unlikely He and Aufidius can no more atone Than violent'st contrarietya second You are sent for to the Senate A fearful army led by Caius Marcius Associated with Aufidius rages Upon our territories and have already O'erborne their way consum'd with fire and took What lay before themO you have made good workWhat news what newsYou have holp to ravish your own daughters and To melt the city leads upon your pates To see your wives dishonour'd to your nosesWhat's the news What's the newsYour temples burned in their cement and Your franchises whereon you stood confin'd Into an auger's borePray now your news You have made fair work I fear me Pray your news If Marcius should be join'd wi' th' VolsciansIf He is their god he leads them like a thing Made by some other deity than Nature That shapes man better and they follow him Against us brats with no less confidence Than boys pursuing summer butterflies Or butchers killing fliesYou have made good work You and your apron men you that stood so much Upon the voice of occupation and The breath of garliceatersHe'll shake Your Rome about your earsAs Hercules Did shake down mellow fruit You have made fair workBut is this true sirAy and you'll look pale Before you find it other All the regions Do smilingly revolt and who resists Are mock'd for valiant ignorance And perish constant fools Who is't can blame him Your enemies and his find something in himWe are all undone unless The noble man have mercyWho shall ask it The tribunes cannot do't for shame the people Deserve such pity of him as the wolf Does of the shepherds for his best friends if they Should say 'Be good to Rome' they charg'd him even As those should do that had deserv'd his hate And therein show'd fike enemies'Tis true If he were putting to my house the brand That should consume it I have not the face To say 'Beseech you cease' You have made fair hands You and your crafts You have crafted fairYou have brought A trembling upon Rome such as was never S' incapable of helpSay not we brought itHow Was't we We lov'd him but like beasts And cowardly nobles gave way unto your clusters Who did hoot him out o' th' cityBut I fear They'll roar him in again Tullus Aufidius The second name of men obeys his points As if he were his officer Desperation Is all the policy strength and defence That Rome can make against them a troop of citizensHere comes the clusters And is Aufidius with him You are they That made the air unwholesome when you cast Your stinking greasy caps in hooting at Coriolanus' exile Now he's coming And not a hair upon a soldier's head Which will not prove a whip as many coxcombs As you threw caps up will he tumble down And pay you for your voices 'Tis no matter If he could burn us all into one coal We have deserv'd itFaith we hear fearful newsFor mine own part When I said banish him I said 'twas pityAnd so did And so did I and to say the truth so did very many of us That we did we did for the best and though we willingly consented to his banishment yet it was against our willY'are goodly things you voicesYou have made Good work you and your cry Shall's to the CapitolO ay what elseGo masters get you be not dismay'd These are a side that would be glad to have This true which they so seem to fear Go home And show no sign of fearThe gods be good to us Come masters let's home I ever said we were i' th' wrong when we banish'd himSo did we all But come let's home citizensI do not like this newsNor Let's to the Capitol Would half my wealth Would buy this for a liePray let's goA camp at a short distance from Romewith his Do they still fly to th' RomanI do not know what witchcraft's in him but Your soldiers use him as the grace fore meat Their talk at table and their thanks at end And you are dark'ned in this action sir Even by your ownI cannot help it now Unless by using means I lame the foot Of our design He bears himself more proudlier Even to my person than I thought he would When first I did embrace him yet his nature In that's no changeling and I must excuse What cannot be amendedYet I wish sir I mean for your particular you had not Join'd in commission with him but either Had borne the action of yourself or else To him had left it solelyI understand thee well and be thou sure When he shall come to his account he knows not What I can urge against him Although it seems And so he thinks and is no less apparent To th' vulgar eye that he bears all things fairly And shows good husbandry for the Volscian state Fights dragonlike and does achieve as soon As draw his sword yet he hath left undone That which shall break his neck or hazard mine Whene'er we come to our accountSir I beseech you think you he'll carry RomeAll places yield to him ere he sits down And the nobility of Rome are his The senators and patricians love him too The tribunes are no soldiers and their people Will be as rash in the repeal as hasty To expel him thence I think he'll be to Rome As is the osprey to the fish who takes it By sovereignty of nature First he was A noble servant to them but he could not Carry his honours even Whether 'twas pride Which out of daily fortune ever taints The happy man whether defect of judgment To fail in the disposing of those chances Which he was lord of or whether nature Not to be other than one thing not moving From th' casque to th' cushion but commanding peace Even with the same austerity and garb As he controll'd the war but one of these As he hath spices of them all not all For I dare so far free him made him fear'd So hated and so banish'd But he has a merit To choke it in the utt'rance So our virtues Lie in th' interpretation of the time And power unto itself most commendable Hath not a tomb so evident as a chair T' extol what it hath done One fire drives out one fire one nail one nail Rights by rights falter strengths by strengths do fail Come let's away When Caius Rome is thine Thou art poor'st of all then shortly art thou mine
