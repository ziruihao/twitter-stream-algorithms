Yorkshire Within the Forest of Gaultreethe and othersWhat is this forest call'd'Tis Gaultree Forest an't shall please your GraceHere stand my lords and send discoverers forth To know the numbers of our enemiesWe have sent forth already'Tis well done My friends and brethren in these great affairs I must acquaint you that I have receiv'd Newdated letters from Northumberland Their cold intent tenour and substance thus Here doth he wish his person with such powers As might hold sortance with his quality The which he could not levy whereupon He is retir'd to ripe his growing fortunes To Scotland and concludes in hearty prayers That your attempts may overlive the hazard And fearful meeting of their oppositeThus do the hopes we have in him touch ground And dash themselves to piecesA Now what newsWest of this forest scarcely off a mile In goodly form comes on the enemy And by the ground they hide I judge their number Upon or near the rate of thirty thousandThe just proportion that we gave them out Let us sway on and face them in the fieldWhat wellappointed leader fronts us hereI think it is my Lord of WestmorelandHealth and fair greeting from our general The Prince Lord John and Duke of LancasterSay on my Lord of Westmoreland in peace What doth concern your comingThen my lord Unto your Grace do I in chief address The substance of my speech If that rebellion Came like itself in base and abject routs Led on by bloody youth guarded with rags And countenanc'd by boys and beggary I say if damn'd commotion so appear'd In his true native and most proper shape You reverend father and these noble lords Had not been here to dress the ugly form Of base and bloody insurrection With your fair honours You Lord Archbishop Whose see is by a civil peace maintain'd Whose beard the silver hand of peace hath touch'd Whose learning and good letters peace hath tutor'd Whose white investments figure innocence The dove and very blessed spirit of peace Wherefore you do so ill translate yourself Out of the speech of peace that bears such grace Into the harsh and boist'rous tongue of war Turning your books to graves your ink to blood Your pens to lances and your tongue divine To a loud trumpet and a point of warWherefore do I this So the question stands Briefly to this end we are all diseas'd And with our surfeiting and wanton hours Have brought ourselves into a burning fever And we must bleed for it of which disease Our late King Richard being infected died But my most noble Lord of Westmoreland I take not on me here as a physician Nor do I as an enemy to peace Troop in the throngs of military men But rather show awhile like fearful war To diet rank minds sick of happiness And purge th' obstructions which begin to stop Our very veins of life Hear me more plainly I have in equal balance justly weigh'd What wrongs our arms may do what wrongs we suffer And find our griefs heavier than our offences We see which way the stream of time doth run And are enforc'd from our most quiet there By the rough torrent of occasion And have the summary of all our griefs When time shall serve to show in articles Which long ere this we offer'd to the King And might by no suit gain our audience When we are wrong'd and would unfold our griefs We are denied access unto his person Even by those men that most have done us wrong The dangers of the days but newly gone Whose memory is written on the earth With yet appearing blood and the examples Of every minute's instance present now Hath put us in these illbeseeming arms Not to break peace or any branch of it But to establish here a peace indeed Concurring both in name and qualityWhen ever yet was your appeal denied Wherein have you been galled by the King What peer hath been suborn'd to grate on you That you should seal this lawless bloody book Of forg'd rebellion with a seal divine And consecrate commotion's bitter edgeMy brother general the commonwealth To brother horn an household cruelty I make my quarrel in particularThere is no need of any such redress Or if there were it not belongs to youWhy not to him in part and to us all That feel the bruises of the days before And suffer the condition of these times To lay a heavy and unequal hand Upon our honoursO my good Lord Mowbray Construe the times to their necessities And you shall say indeed it is the time And not the King that doth you injuries Yet for your part it not appears to me Either from the King or in the present time That you should have an inch of any ground To build a grief on Were you not restor'd To all the Duke of Norfolk's signiories Your noble and right wellrememb'red father'sWhat thing in honour had my father lost That need to be reviv'd and breath'd in me The King that lov'd him as the state stood then Was force perforce compell'd to banish him And then that Henry Bolingbroke and he Being mounted and both roused in their seats Their neighing coursers daring of the spur Their armed staves in charge their beavers down Their eyes of fire sparkling through sights of steel And the loud trumpet blowing them together Then then when there was nothing could have stay'd My father from the breast of Bolingbroke O when the King did throw his warder down His own life hung upon the staff he threw Then threw he down himself and all their lives That by indictment and by dint of sword Have since miscarried under BolingbrokeYou speak Lord Mowbray now you know not what The Earl of Hereford was reputed then In England the most valiant gentleman Who knows on whom fortune would then have smil'd But if your father had been victor there He ne'er had borne it out of Coventry For all the country in a general voice Cried hate upon him and all their prayers and love Were set on Hereford whom they doted on And bless'd and grac'd indeed more than the King But this is mere digression from my purpose Here come I from our princely general To know your griefs to tell you from his Grace That he will give you audience and wherein It shall appear that your demands are just You shall enjoy them everything set off That might so much as think you enemiesBut he hath forc'd us to compel this offer And it proceeds from policy not loveMowbray you overween to take it so This offer comes from mercy not from fear For lo within a ken our army lies Upon mine honour all too confident To give admittance to a thought of fear Our battle is more full of names than yours Our men more perfect in the use of arms Our armour all as strong our cause the best Then reason will our hearts should be as good Say you not then our offer is compell'dWell by my will we shall admit no parleyThat argues but the shame of your offence A rotten case abides no handlingHath the Prince John a full commission In very ample virtue of his father To hear and absolutely to determine Of what conditions we shall stand uponThat is intended in the general's name I muse you make so slight a questionThen take my Lord of Westmoreland this schedule For this contains our general grievances Each several article herein redress'd All members of our cause both here and hence That are insinewed to this action Acquitted by a true substantial form And present execution of our wills To us and to our purposes confin'd We come within our awful banks again And knit our powers to the arm of peaceThis will I show the general Please you lords In sight of both our battles we may meet And either end in peace which God so frame Or to the place of diff'rence call the swords Which must decide itMy lord we will do so There is a thing within my bosom tells me That no conditions of our peace can standFear you not that if we can make our peace Upon such large terms and so absolute As our conditions shall consist upon Our peace shall stand as firm as rocky mountainsYea but our valuation shall be such That every slight and falsederived cause Yea every idle nice and wanton reason Shall to the King taste of this action That were our royal faiths martyrs in love We shall be winnow'd with so rough a wind That even our corn shall seem as light as chaff And good from bad find no partitionNo no my lord Note this the King is weary Of dainty and such picking grievances For he hath found to end one doubt by death Revives two greater in the heirs of life And therefore will he wipe his tables clean And keep no telltale to his memory That may repeat and history his los To new remembrance For full well he knows He cannot so precisely weed this land As his misdoubts present occasion His foes are so enrooted with his friends That plucking to unfix an enemy He doth unfasten so and shake a friend So that this land like an offensive wife That hath enrag'd him on to offer strokes As he is striking holds his infant up And hangs resolv'd correction in the arm That was uprear'd to executionBesides the King hath wasted all his rods On late offenders that he now doth lack The very instruments of chastisement So that his power like to a fangless lion May offer but not hold'Tis very true And therefore be assur'd my good Lord Marshal If we do now make our atonement well Our peace will like a broken limb united Grow stronger for the breakingBe it so Here is return'd my Lord of WestmorelandRe The Prince is here at hand Pleaseth your lordship To meet his Grace just distance 'tween our armiesYour Grace of York in

here my cousin Mowbray Good day to you gentle Lord Archbishop And so to you Lord Hastings and to all My Lord of York it better show'd with you When that your flock assembled by the bell Encircled you to hear with reverence Your exposition on the holy text Than now to see you here an iron man Cheering a rout of rebels with your drum Turning the word to sword and life to death That man that sits within a monarch's heart And ripens in the sunshine of his favour Would he abuse the countenance of the king Alack what mischiefs might he set abroach In shadow of such greatness With you Lord Bishop It is even so Who hath not heard it spoken How deep you were within the books of God To us the speaker in His parliament To us th' imagin'd voice of God himself The very opener and intelligencer Between the grace the sanctities of heaven And our dull workings O who shall believe But you misuse the reverence of your place Employ the countenance and grace of heav'n As a false favourite doth his prince's name In deeds dishonourable You have ta'en up Under the counterfeited zeal of God The subjects of His substitute my father And both against the peace of heaven and him Have here upswarm'd themGood my Lord of Lancaster I am not here against your father's peace But as I told my Lord of Westmoreland The time misord'red doth in common sense Crowd us and crush us to this monstrous form To hold our safety up I sent your Grace The parcels and particulars of our grief The which hath been with scorn shov'd from the court Whereon this hydra son of war is born Whose dangerous eyes may well be charm'd asleep With grant of our most just and right desires And true obedience of this madness cur'd Stoop tamely to the foot of majestyIf not we ready are to try our fortunes To the last manAnd though we here fall down We have supplies to second our attempt If they miscarry theirs shall second them And so success of mischief shall be born And heir from heir shall hold this quarrel up Whiles England shall have generationare too shallow Hastings much to shallow To sound the bottom of the aftertimesPleaseth your Grace to answer them directly How far forth you do like their articlesI like them all and do allow them well And swear here by the honour of my blood My father's purposes have been mistook And some about him have too lavishly Wrested his meaning and authority My lord these griefs shall be with speed redress'd Upon my soul they shall If this may please you Discharge your powers unto their several counties As we will ours and here between the armies Let's drink together friendly and embrace That all their eyes may bear those tokens home Of our restored love and amityI take your princely word for these redressesI give it you and will maintain my word And thereupon I drink unto your GraceGo Captain and deliver to the army This news of peace Let them have pay and part I know it will please them Hie thee CaptainOfficerTo you my noble Lord of WestmorelandI pledge

assembly soWill you thus break your faithI pawn'd thee none I promis'd you redress of these same grievances Whereof you did complain which by mine honour I will perform with a most Christian care But

motion the expedition of thought I have speeded hither with the very extremest inch of possibility I have found'red nine score and odd posts and here travel tainted as I am have in my pure and

same young soberblooded boy doth not love me nor a man cannot make him laugh but that's no marvel he drinks no wine There's never none of these demure boys come to any proof for thin drink doth so overcool their blood and making many fishmeals that they fall into a kind of male greensickness and then when they marry they get wenches They are generally fools and cowardswhich some of us should be too but for inflammation A good sherrissack hath a twofold operation in it It ascends me into the brain dries me there all the foolish and dull and crudy vapours which environ it makes it apprehensive quick forgetive full of nimble fiery and delectable shapes which delivered o'er to the voice the tongue which is the birth becomes excellent wit The second property of your excellent sherris is the warming of the blood which before cold and settled left the liver white and pale which is the badge of pusillanimity and cowardice but the sherris warms it and makes it course from the inwards to the parts extremes It illumineth the face which as a beacon gives warning to all the rest of this little kingdom man to arm and then the vital commoners and inland petty spirits muster me all to their captain the heart who great and puff'd up with this retinue doth any deed of courage and this valour comes of sherris So that skill in the weapon is nothing without sack for that sets it awork and learning a mere hoard of gold kept by a devil till sack commences it and sets it in act and use Hereof comes it that Prince Harry is valiant for the cold blood he did naturally inherit of his father he hath like lean sterile and bare land manured husbanded and till'd with excellent endeavour of drinking good and good store of fertile sherris that he is become very hot and valiant If I had a thousand sons the first humane principle I would teach them should be to forswear thin potations and to addict themselves to sackHow now BardolphThe army is discharged all and goneLet them go I'll through Gloucestershire and there will I visit Master Robert Shallow Esquire I have him already temp'ring between my finger and my thumb and shortly will I seal with him Come awayWestminster The Jerusalem Chamberthe and othersNow lords if God doth give successful end To this debate that bleedeth at our doors We will our youth lead on to higher fields And draw no swords but what are sanctified Our navy is address'd our power connected Our substitutes in absence well invested And everything lies level to our wish Only we want a little personal strength And pause us till these rebels now afoot Come underneath the yoke of governmentBoth which we doubt not but your Majesty Shall soon enjoyHumphrey my son of Gloucester Where is the Prince your brotherI think he's gone to hunt my lord at WindsorAnd how accompaniedI do not know my lordIs not his brother Thomas of Clarence with himNo my good lord he is in presence hereWhat would my lord and fatherNothing but well to thee Thomas of Clarence How chance thou art not with the Prince thy brother He loves thee and thou dost neglect him Thomas Thou hast a better place in his affection Than all thy brothers cherish it my boy And noble offices thou mayst effect Of mediation after I am dead Between his greatness and thy other brethren Therefore omit him not blunt not his love Nor lose the good advantage of his grace By seeming cold or careless of his will For he is gracious if he be observ'd He hath a tear for pity and a hand Open as day for melting charity Yet notwithstanding being incens'd he is flint As humorous as winter and as sudden As flaws congealed in the spring of day His temper therefore must be well observ'd Chide him for faults and do it reverently When you perceive his blood inclin'd to mirth But being moody give him line and scope Till that his passions like a whale on ground Confound themselves with working Learn this Thomas And thou shalt prove a shelter to thy friends A hoop of gold to bind thy brothers in That the united vessel of their blood Mingled with venom of suggestion As force perforce the age will pour it in Shall never leak though it do work as strong As aconitum or rash gunpowderI shall observe him with all care and loveWhy art thou not at Windsor with him ThomasHe is not there today he dines in LondonAnd how accompanied Canst thou tell thatWith Poins and other his continual followersMost subject is the fattest soil to weeds And he the noble image of my youth Is overspread with them therefore my grief Stretches itself beyond the hour of death The blood weeps from my heart when I do shape In forms imaginary th'unguided days And rotten times that you shall look upon When I am sleeping with my ancestors For when his headstrong riot hath no curb When rage and hot blood are his counsellors When means and lavish manners meet together O with what wings shall his affections fly Towards fronting peril and oppos'd decayMy gracious lord you look beyond him quite The Prince but studies his companions Like a strange tongue wherein to gain the language 'Tis needful that the most immodest word Be look'd upon and learnt which once attain'd Your Highness knows comes to no further use But to be known and hated So like gross terms The Prince will in the perfectness of time Cast off his followers and their memory Shall as a pattern or a measure live By which his Grace must mete the lives of other Turning past evils to advantages'Tis seldom when the bee doth leave her comb In the dead carrion Who's here WestmorelandHealth to my sovereign and new happiness Added to that that am to deliver Prince John your son doth kiss your Grace's hand Mowbray the Bishop Scroop Hastings and all Are brought to the correction of your law There is not now a rebel's sword unsheath'd But Peace puts forth her olive everywhere The manner how this action hath been borne Here at more leisure may your Highness read With every course in his particularO Westmoreland thou art a summer bird Which ever in the haunch of winter sings The lifting up of day Look here's more newsFrom enemies heaven keep your Majesty And when they stand against you may they fall As those that I am come to tell you of The Earl Northumberland and the Lord Bardolph With a great power of English and of Scots Are by the shrieve of Yorkshire overthrown The manner and true order of the fight This packet please it you contains at largeAnd wherefore should these good news make me sick Will Fortune never come with both hands full But write her fair words still in foulest letters She either gives a stomach and no food Such are the poor in health or else a feast And takes away the stomach such are the rich That have abundance and enjoy it not I should rejoice now at this happy news And now my sight fails and my brain is giddy O me come near me now I am much illComfort your MajestyO my royal fatherMy sovereign lord cheer up yourself look upBe patient Princes you do know these fits Are with his Highness very ordinary Stand from him give him air he'll straight be wellNo no he cannot long hold out these pangs Th' incessant care and labour of his mind Hath wrought the mure that should confine it in So thin that life looks through and will break outThe people fear me for they do observe Unfather'd heirs and loathly births of nature The seasons change their manners as the year Had found some months asleep and leapt them overThe river hath thrice flow'd no ebb between And the old folk Time's doting chronicles Say it did so a little time before That our great grandsire Edward sick'd and diedSpeak lower Princes for the King recoversThis apoplexy will certain be his endI pray you take me up and bear me hence Into some other chamber Softly prayWestminster Another chamber The lying on a bedand others in attendanceLet there be no noise made my gentle friends Unless some dull and favourable hand Will whisper music to my weary spiritCall for the music in the other roomSet me the crown upon my pillow hereHis eye is hollow and he changes muchLess noise less noiseWho saw the Duke of ClarenceI am here brother full of heavinessHow now Rain within doors and none abroad How doth the KingExceeding illHeard he the good news yet Tell it himHe alt'red much upon the hearing itIf he be sick with joy he'll recover without physicNot so much noise my lords Sweet Prince speak low The King your father is dispos'd to sleepLet us withdraw into the other roomWill't please your Grace to go along with usNo I will sit and watch here by the King all but theWhy doth the crown lie there upon his pillow Being so troublesome a bedfellow O polish'd perturbation golden care That keep'st the ports of slumber open wide To many a watchful night Sleep with it now Yet not so sound and half so deeply sweet As he whose brow with homely biggen bound Snores out the watch of night O majesty When thou dost pinch thy bearer thou dost sit Like a rich armour worn in heat of day That scald'st with safety By his gates of breath There lies a downy feather which stirs not Did he suspire that light and weightless down Perforce must move My gracious lord my father This sleep is sound indeed this is a sleep That from this golden rigol hath divorc'd So many English kings Thy due from me Is tears and heavy sorrows of the blood Which nature love and filial tenderness Shall O dear father pay thee plenteously My due from thee is this imperial crown Which as immediate from thy place and blood Derives itself to mePutting on the crownLo where it sits Which God shall guard and put the world's whole strength Into one giant arm it shall not force This lineal honour from me This from thee Will I to mine leave as 'tis left to meWarwick Gloucester ClarenceRe Doth the King callWhat would your Majesty How fares your GraceWhy did you leave me here alone my lordsWe left the Prince my brother here my liege Who undertook to sit and watch by youThe Prince of Wales Where is he Let me see him He is not hereThis door is open he is gone this wayHe came not through the chamber where we stay'dWhere is the crown Who took it from my pillowWhen we withdrew my liege we left it hereThe Prince hath ta'en it hence Go seek him out Is he so hasty that he doth suppose My sleep my death Find him my lord of Warwick chide him hither This part of his conjoins with my disease And helps to end me See sons what things you are How quickly nature falls into revolt When gold becomes her object For this the foolish overcareful fathers Have broke their sleep with thoughts Their brains with care their bones with industry For this they have engrossed and pil'd up The cank'red heaps of strangeachieved gold For this they have been thoughtful to invest Their sons with arts and martial exercises When like the bee tolling from every flower The virtuous sweets Our thighs with wax our mouths with honey pack'd We bring it to the hive and like the bees Are murd'red for our pains This bitter taste Yields his engrossments to the ending fatherReNow where is he that will not stay so long Till his friend sickness hath determin'd meMy lord I found the Prince in the next room Washing with kindly tears his gentle cheeks With such a deep demeanour in great sorrow That tyranny which never quaff'd but blood Would by beholding him have wash'd his knife With gentle eyedrops He is coming hitherBut wherefore did he take away the crown ReLo where he comes Come hither to me Harry Depart the chamber leave us here aloneall but the and the I never thought to hear you speak againThy wish was father Harry to that thought I stay too long by thee I weary thee Dost thou so hunger for mine empty chair That thou wilt needs invest thee with my honours Before thy hour be ripe O foolish youth Thou seek'st the greatness that will overwhelm thee Stay but a little for my cloud of dignity Is held from falling with so weak a wind That it will quickly drop my day is dim Thou hast stol'n that which after some few hours Were thine without offense and at my death Thou hast seal'd up my expectation Thy life did manifest thou lov'dst me not And thou wilt have me die assur'd of it Thou hid'st a thousand daggers in thy thoughts Which thou hast whetted on thy stony heart To stab at half an hour of my life What canst thou not forbear me half an hour Then get thee gone and dig my grave thyself And bid the merry bells ring to thine ear That thou art crowned not that I am dead Let all the tears that should bedew my hearse Be drops of balm to sanctify thy head Only compound me with forgotten dust Give that which gave thee life unto the worms Pluck down my officers break my decrees For now a time is come to mock at form Harry the Fifth is crown'd Up vanity Down royal state All you sage counsellors hence And to the English court assemble now From every region apes of idleness Now neighbour confines purge you of your scum Have you a ruffian that will swear drink dance Revel the night rob murder and commit The oldest sins the newest kind of ways Be happy he will trouble you no more England shall double gild his treble guilt England shall give him office honour might For the fifth Harry from curb'd license plucks The muzzle of restraint and the wild dog Shall flesh his tooth on every innocent O my poor kingdom sick with civil blows When that my care could not withhold thy riots What wilt thou do when riot is thy care O thou wilt be a wilderness again Peopled with wolves thy old inhabitantsO pardon me my liege But for my tears The moist impediments unto my speech I had forestall'd this dear and deep rebuke Ere you with grief had spoke and I had heard The course of it so far There is your crown And he that wears the crown immortally Long guard it yoursKneelingIf I affect it more Than as your honour and as your renown Let me no more from this obedience rise Which my most inward true and duteous spirit Teacheth this prostrate and exterior bending God witness with me when I here came in And found no course of breath within your Majesty How cold it struck my heart If I do feign O let me in my present wildness die And never live to show th' incredulous world The noble change that I have purposed Coming to look on you thinking you dead And dead almost my liege to think you were I spake unto this crown as having sense And thus upbraided it 'The care on thee depending Hath fed upon the body of my father Therefore thou best of gold art worst of gold Other less fine in carat is more precious Preserving life in med'cine potable But thou most fine most honour'd most renown'd Hast eat thy bearer up' Thus my most royal liege Accusing it I put it on my head To try with it as with an enemy That had before my face murd'red my father The quarrel of a true inheritor But if it did infect my blood with joy Or swell my thoughts to any strain of pride If any rebel or vain spirit of mine Did with the least affection of a welcome Give tainment to the might of it Let God for ever keep it from my head And make me as the poorest vassal is That doth with awe and terror kneel to itO my son God put it in thy mind to take it hence That thou mightst win the more thy father's love Pleading so wisely in excuse of it Come hither Harry sit thou by my bed And hear I think the very latest counsel That ever I shall breathe God knows my son By what bypaths and indirect crook'd ways I met this crown and I myself know well How troublesome it sat upon my head To thee it shall descend with better quiet Better opinion better confirmation For all the soil of the achievement goes With me into the earth It seem'd in me But as an honour snatch'd with boist'rous hand And I had many living to upbraid My gain of it by their assistances Which daily grew to quarrel and to bloodshed Wounding supposed peace All these bold fears Thou seest with peril I have answered For all my reign hath been but as a scene Acting that argument And now my death Changes the mood for what in me was purchas'd Falls upon thee in a more fairer sort So thou the garland wear'st successively Yet though thou stand'st more sure than I could do Thou art not firm enough since griefs are green And all my friends which thou must make thy friends Have but their stings and teeth newly ta'en out By whose fell working I was first advanc'd And by whose power I well might lodge a fear To be again displac'd which to avoid I cut them off and had a purpose now To lead out many to the Holy Land Lest rest and lying still might make them look Too near unto my state Therefore my Harry Be it thy course to busy giddy minds With foreign quarrels that action hence borne out May waste the memory of the former days More would I but my lungs are wasted so That strength of speech is utterly denied me How I came by the crown O God forgive And grant it may with thee in true peace liveMy gracious liege You won it wore it kept it gave it me Then plain and right must my possession be Which I with more than with a common pain 'Gainst all the world will rightfully maintain and othersLook look here comes my John of LancasterHealth peace and happiness to my royal fatherThou bring'st me happiness and peace son John But health alack with youthful wings is flown From this bare wither'd trunk Upon thy sight My worldly business makes a period Where is my Lord of WarwickMy Lord of WarwickDoth any name particular belong Unto the lodging where I first did swoon'Tis call'd Jerusalem my noble lordLaud be to God Even there my life must end It hath been prophesied to me many years I should not die but in Jerusalem Which vainly I suppos'd the Holy Land But bear me to that chamber there I'll lie In that Jerusalem shall Harry die
