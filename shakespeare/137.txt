The wood lying asleep and Are we all metPat pat and here's a marvellous convenient place for our rehearsal This green plot shall be our stage this hawthorn brake our tiringhouse and we will do it in action as we will do it before the DukePeter QuinceWhat sayest thou bully BottomThere are things in this comedy of Pyramus and Thisby that will never please First Pyramus must draw a sword to kill himself which the ladies cannot abide How answer you thatBy'r lakin a parlous fearI believe we must leave the killing out when all is doneNot a whit I have a device to make all well Write me a prologue and let the prologue seem to say we will do no harm with our swords and that Pyramus is not kill'd indeed and for the more better assurance tell them that I Pyramus am not Pyramus but Bottom the weaver This will put them out of fearWell we will have such a prologue and it shall be written in eight and sixNo make it two more let it be written in eight and eightWill not the ladies be afeard of the lionI fear it I promise youMasters you ought to consider with yourself to bring in God shield us a lion among ladies is a most dreadful thing for there is not a more fearful wildfowl than your lion living and we ought to look to'tTherefore another prologue must tell he is not a lionNay you must name his name and half his face must be seen through the lion's neck and he himself must speak through saying thus or to the same defect 'Ladies' or 'Fair ladies I would wish you' or 'I would request you' or 'I would entreat you not to fear not to tremble My life for yours If you think I come hither as a lion it were pity of my life No I am no such thing I am a man as other men are' And there indeed let him name his name and tell them plainly he is Snug the joinerWell it shall be so But there is two hard things that is to bring the moonlight into a chamber for you know Pyramus and Thisby meet by moonlightDoth the moon shine that night we play our playA calendar a calendar Look in the almanack find out moonshine find out moonshineYes it doth shine that nightWhy then may you leave a casement of the great chamber window where we play open and the moon may shine in at the casementAy or else one must come in with a bush of thorns and a lantern and say he comes to disfigure or to present the person of Moonshine Then there is another thing we must have a wall in the great chamber for Pyramus and Thisby says the story did talk through the chink of a wallYou can never bring in a wall What say you BottomSome man or other must present Wall and let him have some plaster or some loam or some roughcast about him to signify wall and let him hold his fingers thus and through that cranny shall Pyramus and Thisby whisperIf that may be then all is well Come sit down every mother's son and rehearse your parts Pyramus you begin when you have spoken your speechinto that brake and so every one according to his cuebehindWhat hempen homespuns have we swagg'ring here So near the cradle of the Fairy Queen What a play toward I'll be an auditor An actor too perhaps if I see causeSpeak Pyramus Thisby stand forthThisby the flowers of odious savours sweet'Odious' odorousodours savours sweet So hath thy breath my dearest Thisby dear But hark a voice Stay thou but here awhile And by and by I will to thee appearA stranger Pyramus than e'er played here Must I speak nowAy marry must you for you must understand he goes but to see a noise that he heard and is to come againMost radiant Pyramus most lilywhite of hue Of colour like the red rose on triumphant brier Most brisky juvenal and eke most lovely Jew As true as truest horse that would never tire I'll meet thee Pyramus at Ninny's tomb'Ninus' tomb' man Why you must not speak that yet that you answer to Pyramus You speak all your part at once cues and all Pyramusyour cue is past it is 'never tire'O As true as truest horse that y et would never tire Reand with an ass's headIf I were fair Thisby I were only thineO monstrous O strange We are haunted Pray masters fly masters Helpall but and I'll follow you I'll lead you about a round Through bog through bush through brake through brier Sometime a horse I'll be sometime a hound A hog a headless bear sometime a fire And neigh and bark and grunt and roar and burn Like horse hound hog bear fire at every turnWhy do they run away This is a knavery of them to make me afeard Re O Bottom thou art chang'd What do I see on theeWhat do you see You see an asshead of your own do you Re Bless thee Bottom bless thee Thou art translatedI see their knavery this is to make an ass of me to fright me if they could But I will not stir from this place do what they can I will walk up and down here and will sing that they shall hear I am not afraid Sings The ousel cock so black of hue With orangetawny bill The throstle with his note so true The wren with little quillWhat angel wakes me from my flow'ry bedSings The finch the sparrow and the lark The plainsong cuckoo grey Whose note full many a man doth mark And dares not answer nay for indeed who would set his wit to so foolish a bird Who would give a bird the he though he cry 'cuckoo' never soI pray thee gentle mortal sing again Mine ear is much enamoured of thy note So is mine eye enthralled to thy shape And thy fair virtue's force perforce doth move me On the first view to say to swear I love theeMethinks mistress you should have little reason for that And yet to say the truth reason and love keep little company together nowadays The more the pity that some honest neighbours will not make them friends Nay I can gleek upon occasionThou art as wise as thou art beautifulNot so neither but if I had wit enough to get out of this wood I have enough to serve mine own turnOut of this wood do not desire to go Thou shalt remain here whether thou wilt or no I am a spirit of no common rate The summer still doth tend upon my state And I do love thee therefore go with me I'll give thee fairies to attend on thee And they shall fetch thee jewels from the deep And sing while thou on pressed flowers dost sleep And I will purge thy mortal grossness so That thou shalt like an airy spirit go Peaseblossom Cobweb Moth and Mustardseedand ReadyAnd And And Where shall we goBe kind and courteous to this gentleman Hop in his walks and gambol in his eyes Feed him with apricocks and dewberries With purple grapes green figs and mulberries The honey bags steal from the humblebees And for nighttapers crop their waxen thighs And light them at the fiery glowworm's eyes To have my love to bed and to arise And pluck the wings from painted butterflies To fan the moonbeams from his sleeping eyes Nod to him elves and do him courtesiesHail mortalHailHailHailI cry your worships mercy heartily I beseech your worship's nameCobwebI shall desire you of more acquaintance good Master Cobweb If I cut my finger I shall make bold with you Your name honest gentlemanPeaseblossomI pray you commend me to Mistress Squash your mother and to Master Peascod your father Good Master Peaseblossom I shall desire you of more acquaintance too Your name I beseech you sirMustardseedGood Master Mustardseed I know your patience well That same cowardly giantlike oxbeef hath devour'd many a gentleman of your house I promise you your kindred hath made my eyes water ere now I desire you of more acquaintance good Master MustardseedCome wait upon him lead him to my bower The moon methinks looks with a wat'ry eye And when she weeps weeps every little flower Lamenting some enforced chastity Tie up my love's tongue bring him silentlyAnother part of the woodI wonder if Titania be awak'd Then what it was that next came in her eye Which she must dote on in extremity Here comes my messenger How now mad spirit What nightrule now about this haunted groveMy mistress with a monster is in love Near to her close and consecrated bower While she was in her dull and sleeping hour A crew of patches rude mechanicals That work for bread upon Athenian stalls Were met together to rehearse a play Intended for great Theseus' nuptial day The shallowest thickskin of that barren sort Who Pyramus presented in their sport Forsook his scene and ent'red in a brake When I did him at this advantage take An ass's nole I fixed on his head Anon his Thisby must be answered And forth my mimic comes When they him spy As wild geese that the creeping fowler eye Or russetpated choughs many in sort Rising and cawing at the gun's report Sever themselves and madly sweep the sky So at his sight away his fellows fly And at our stamp here o'er and o'er one falls He murder cries and help from Athens calls Their sense thus weak lost with their fears thus strong Made senseless things begin to do them wrong For briers and thorns at their apparel snatch Some sleeves some hats from yielders all things catch I led them on in this distracted fear And left sweet Pyramus translated there When in that moment so it came to pass Titania wak'd and straightway lov'd an assThis falls out better than I could devise But hast thou yet latch'd the Athenian's eyes With the lovejuice as I did bid thee doI took him sleeping that is finish'd too And the Athenian woman by his side That when he wak'd of force she must be ey'd and Stand close this is the same AthenianThis is the woman but not this the manO why rebuke you him that loves you so Lay breath so bitter on your bitter foeNow I but chide but I should use thee worse For thou I fear hast given me cause to curse If thou hast slain Lysander in his sleep Being o'er shoes in blood plunge in the deep And kill me too The sun was not so true unto the day As he to me Would he have stolen away From sleeping Hermia I'll believe as soon This whole earth may be bor'd and that the moon May through the centre creep and so displease Her brother's noontide with th' Antipodes It cannot be but thou hast murd'red him So should a murderer look so dead so grimSo should the murdered look and so should I Pierc'd through the heart with your stern cruelty Yet you the murderer look as bright as clear As yonder Venus in her glimmering sphereWhat's this to my Lysander Where is he Ah good Demetrius wilt thou give him meI had rather give his carcass to my houndsOut dog out cur Thou driv'st me past the bounds Of maiden's patience Hast thou slain him then Henceforth be never numb'red among men O once tell true tell true even for my sake Durst thou have look'd upon him being awake And hast thou kill'd him sleeping O brave touch Could not a worm an adder do so much An adder did it for with doubler tongue Than thine thou serpent never adder stungYou spend your passion on a mispris'd mood I am not guilty of Lysander's blood Nor is he dead for aught that I can tellI pray thee tell me then that he is wellAn if I could what should I get thereforeA privilege never to see me more And from thy hated presence part I so See me no more whether he be dead or noThere is no following her in this fierce vein Here therefore for a while I will remain So sorrow's heaviness doth heavier grow For debt that bankrupt sleep doth sorrow owe Which now in some slight measure it will pay If for his tender here I make some stay Lies downWhat hast thou done Thou hast mistaken quite And laid the lovejuice on some truelove's sight Of thy misprision must perforce ensue Some true love turn'd and not a false turn'd trueThen fate o'errules that one man holding troth A million fail confounding oath on oathAbout the wood go swifter than the wind And Helena of Athens look thou find All fancysick she is and pale of cheer With sighs of love that costs the fresh blood dear By some illusion see thou bring her here I'll charm his eyes against she do appearI go I go look how I go Swifter than arrow from the Tartar's bow Flower of this purple dye Hit with Cupid's archery Sink in apple of his eye When his love he doth espy Let her shine as gloriously As the Venus of the sky When thou wak'st if she be by Beg of her for remedyRe Captain of our fairy band Helena is here at hand And the youth mistook by me Pleading for a lover's fee Shall we their fond pageant see Lord what fools these mortals beStand aside The noise they make Will cause Demetrius to awakeThen will two at once woo one That must needs be sport alone And those things do best please me That befall prepost'rously and Why should you think that I should woo in scorn Scorn and derision never come in tears Look when I vow I weep and vows so born In their nativity all truth appears How can these things in me seem scorn to you Bearing the badge of faith to prove them trueYou do advance your cunning more and more When truth kills truth O devilishholy fray These vows are Hermia's Will you give her o'er Weigh oath with oath and you will nothing weigh Your vows to her and me put in two scales Will even weigh and both as light as talesI hod no judgment when to her I sworeNor none in my mind now you give her o'erDemetrius loves her and he loves not youAwaking O Helen goddess nymph perfect divine To what my love shall I compare thine eyne Crystal is muddy O how ripe in show Thy lips those kissing cherries tempting grow That pure congealed white high Taurus' snow Fann'd with the eastern wind turns to a crow When thou hold'st up thy hand O let me kiss This princess of pure white this seal of blissO spite O hell I see you all are bent To set against me for your merriment If you were civil and knew courtesy You would not do me thus much injury Can you not hate me as I know you do But you must join in souls to mock me too If you were men as men you are in show You would not use a gentle lady so To vow and swear and superpraise my parts When I am sure you hate me with your hearts You both are rivals and love Hermia And now both rivals to mock Helena A trim exploit a manly prise To conjure tears up in a poor maid's eyes With your derision None of noble sort Would so offend a virgin and extort A poor soul's patience all to make you sportYou are unkind Demetrius be not so For you love Hermia This you know I know And here with all good will with all my heart In Hermia's love I yield you up my part And yours of Helena to me bequeath Whom I do love and will do till my deathNever did mockers waste more idle breathLysander keep thy Hermia I will none If e'er I lov'd her all that love is gone My heart to her but as guestwise sojourn'd And now to Helen is it home return'd There to remainHelen it is not soDisparage not the faith thou dost not know Lest to thy peril thou aby it dear Look where thy love comes yonder is thy dear Dark night that from the eye his function takes The ear more quick of apprehension makes Wherein it doth impair the seeing sense It pays the hearing double recompense Thou art not by mine eye Lysander found Mine ear I thank it brought me to thy sound But why unkindly didst thou leave me soWhy should he stay whom love doth press to goWhat love could press Lysander from my sideLysander's love that would not let him bide Fair Helena who more engilds the night Than all yon fiery oes and eyes of light Why seek'st thou me Could not this make thee know The hate I bare thee made me leave thee soYou speak not as you think it cannot beLo she is one of this confederacy Now I perceive they have conjoin'd all three To fashion this false sport in spite of me Injurious Hermia most ungrateful maid Have you conspir'd have you with these contriv'd To bait me with this foul derision Is all the counsel that we two have shar'd The sisters' vows the hours that we have spent When we have chid the hastyfooted time For parting us O is all forgot All schooldays' friendship childhood innocence We Hermia like two artificial gods Have with our needles created both one flower Both on one sampler sitting on one cushion Both warbling of one song both in one key As if our hands our sides voices and minds Had been incorporate So we grew together Like to a double cherry seeming parted But yet an union in partition Two lovely berries moulded on one stern So with two seeming bodies but one heart Two of the first like coats in heraldry Due but to one and crowned with one crest And will you rent our ancient love asunder To join with men in scorning your poor friend It is not friendly 'tis not maidenly Our sex as well as I may chide you for it Though I alone do feel the injuryI am amazed at your passionate words I scorn you not it seems that you scorn meHave you not set Lysander as in scorn To follow me and praise my eyes and face And made your other love Demetrius Who even but now did spurn me with his foot To call me goddess nymph divine and rare Precious celestial Wherefore speaks he this To her he hates And wherefore doth Lysander Deny your love so rich within his soul And tender me forsooth affection But by your setting on by your consent What though I be not so in grace as you So hung upon with love so fortunate But miserable most to love unlov'd This you should pity rather than despiseI understand not what you mean by thisAy do persever counterfeit sad looks Make mouths upon me when I turn my back Wink each at other hold the sweet jest up This sport well carried shall be chronicled If you have any pity grace or manners You would not make me such an argument But fare ye well 'tis partly my own fault Which death or absence soon shall remedyStay gentle Helena hear my excuse My love my life my soul fair HelenaO excellentSweet do not scorn her soIf she cannot entreat I can compelThou canst compel no more than she entreat Thy threats have no more strength than her weak prayers Helen I love thee by my life I do I swear by that which I will lose for thee To prove him false that says I love thee notI say I love thee more than he can doIf thou say so withdraw and prove it tooQuick comeLysander whereto tends all thisAway you EthiopeNo no he will Seem to break loose take on as you would follow But yet come not You are a tame man goHang off thou cat thou burr vile thing let loose Or I will shake thee from me like a serpentWhy are you grown so rude What change is this Sweet loveThy love Out tawny Tartar out Out loathed med'cine O hated potion henceDo you not jestYes sooth and so do youDemetrius I will keep my word with theeI would I had your bond for I perceive A weak bond holds you I'll not trust your wordWhat should I hurt her strike her kill her dead Although I hate her I'll not harm her soWhat Can you do me greater harm than hate Hate me wherefore O me what news my love Am not I Hermia Are not you Lysander I am as fair now as I was erewhile Since night you lov'd me yet since night you left me Why then you left me O the gods forbid In earnest shall I sayAy by my life And never did desire to see thee more Therefore be out of hope of question of doubt Be certain nothing truer 'tis no jest That I do hate thee and love HelenaO me you juggler you cankerblossom You thief of love What Have you come by night And stol'n my love's heart from himFine i' faith Have you no modesty no maiden shame No touch of bashfulness What Will you tear Impatient answers from my gentle tongue Fie fie you counterfeit you puppet you'Puppet' why so Ay that way goes the game Now I perceive that she hath made compare Between our statures she hath urg'd her height And with her personage her tall personage Her height forsooth she hath prevail'd with him And are you grown so high in his esteem Because I am so dwarfish and so low How low am I thou painted maypole Speak How low am I I am not yet so low But that my nails can reach unto thine eyesI pray you though you mock me gentlemen Let her not hurt me I was never curst I have no gift at all in shrewishness I am a right maid for my cowardice Let her not strike me You perhaps may think Because she is something lower than myself That I can match her'Lower' hark againGood Hermia do not be so bitter with me I evermore did love you Hermia Did ever keep your counsels never wrong'd you Save that in love unto Demetrius I told him of your stealth unto this wood He followed you for love I followed him But he hath chid me hence and threat'ned me To strike me spurn me nay to kill me too And now so you will let me quiet go To Athens will I bear my folly back And follow you no further Let me go You see how simple and how fond I amWhy get you gone Who is't that hinders youA foolish heart that I leave here behindWhat with LysanderWith DemetriusBe not afraid she shall not harm thee HelenaNo sir she shall not though you take her partO when she is angry she is keen and shrewd She was a vixen when she went to school And though she be but little she is fierce'Little' again Nothing but 'low' and 'little' Why will you suffer her to flout me thus Let me come to herGet you gone you dwarf You minimus of hind'ring knotgrass made You bead you acornYou are too officious In her behalf that scorns your services Let her alone speak not of Helena Take not her part for if thou dost intend Never so little show of love to her Thou shalt aby itNow she holds me not Now follow if thou dar'st to try whose right Of thine or mine is most in HelenaFollow Nay I'll go with thee cheek by jowl You mistress all this coil is long of you Nay go not backI will not trust you I Nor longer stay in your curst company Your hands than mine are quicker for a fray My legs are longer though to run away I am amaz'd and know not what to sayThis is thy negligence Still thou mistak'st Or else committ'st thy knaveries wilfullyBelieve me king of shadows I mistook Did not you tell me I should know the man By the Athenian garments he had on And so far blameless proves my prise That I have 'nointed an Athenian's eyes And so far am I glad it so did sort As this their jangling I esteem a sportThou seest these lovers seek a place to fight Hie therefore Robin overcast the night The starry welkin cover thou anon With drooping fog as black as Acheron And lead these testy rivals so astray As one come not within another's way Like to Lysander sometime frame thy tongue Then stir Demetrius up with bitter wrong And sometime rail thou like Demetrius And from each other look thou lead them thus Till o'er their brows deathcounterfeiting sleep With leaden legs and batty wings doth creep Then crush this herb into Lysander's eye Whose liquor hath this virtuous property To take from thence all error with his might And make his eyeballs roll with wonted sight When they next wake all this derision Shall seem a dream and fruitless vision And back to Athens shall the lovers wend With league whose date till death shall never end Whiles I in this affair do thee employ I'll to my queen and beg her Indian boy And then I will her charmed eye release From monster's view and all things shall be peaceMy fairy lord this must be done with haste For night's swift dragons cut the clouds full fast And yonder shines Aurora's harbinger At whose approach ghosts wand'ring here and there Troop home to churchyards Damned spirits all That in crossways and floods have burial Already to their wormy beds are gone For fear lest day should look their shames upon They wilfully themselves exil'd from light And must for aye consort with blackbrow'd nightBut we are spirits of another sort I with the Morning's love have oft made sport And like a forester the groves may tread Even till the eastern gate all fiery red Opening on Neptune with fair blessed beams Turns into yellow gold his salt green streams But notwithstanding haste make no delay We may effect this business yet ere day Up and down up and downI will lead them up and downI am fear'd in field and townGoblin lead them up and down Here comes oneWhere art thou proud Demetrius Speak thou nowHere villain drawn and ready Where art thouI will be with thee straightFollow me then To plainer ground as following the voiceLysander speak again Thou runaway thou coward art thou fled Speak In some bush Where dost thou hide thy headThou coward art thou bragging to the stars Telling the bushes that thou look'st for wars And wilt not come Come recreant come thou child I'll whip thee with a rod He is defil'd That draws a sword on theeYea art thou thereFollow my voice we'll try no manhood hereRe He goes before me and still dares me on When I come where he calls then he is gone The villain is much lighter heel'd thanI followed fast but faster he did fly That fallen am I in dark uneven way And here will rest me Lies down Come thou gentle day For if but once thou show me thy grey light I'll find Demetrius and revenge this spiteSleepsRe and Ho ho ho Coward why com'st thou notAbide me if thou dar'st for well I wot Thou run'st before me shifting every place And dar'st not stand nor look me in the face Where art thou nowCome hither I am hereNay then thou mock'st me Thou shalt buy this dear If ever I thy face by daylight see Now go thy way Faintness constraineth me To measure out my length on this cold bed By day's approach look to be visited Lies down and sleeps O weary night O long and tedious night Abate thy hours Shine comforts from the east That I may back to Athens by daylight From these that my poor company detest And sleep that sometimes shuts up sorrow's eye Steal me awhile from mine own companySleepsYet but three Come one more Two of both kinds makes up four Here she comes curst and sad Cupid is a knavish lad Thus to make poor females mad Never so weary never so in woe Bedabbled with the dew and torn with briers I can no further crawl no further go My legs can keep no pace with my desires Here will I rest me till the break of day Heavens shield Lysander if they mean a fray Lies down and sleeps On the groundSleep soundI'll applyTo your eye Gentle lover remedy Squeezing the juice oneyesWhen thou wak'stThou tak'stTrue delightIn the sight Of thy former lady's eye And the country proverb known That every man should take his own In your waking shall be shownJack shall have
