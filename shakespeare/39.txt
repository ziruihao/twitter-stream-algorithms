SceneElsinore A room in the CastleHoratio Queen and a Gentleman Queen I will not speak with her Gent She is importunate indeed distract Her mood will needs be pitied Queen What would she have Gent She speaks much of her father says she hears There's tricks i' th' world and hems and beats her heart Spurns enviously at straws speaks things in doubt That carry but half sense Her speech is nothing Yet the unshaped use of it doth move The hearers to collection they aim at it And botch the words up fit to their own thoughts Which as her winks and nods and gestures yield them Indeed would make one think there might be thought Though nothing sure yet much unhappily Hor 'Twere good she were spoken with for she may strew Dangerous conjectures in illbreeding minds Queen Let her come in Gentleman Aside To my sick soul as sin's true nature is Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss So full of artless jealousy is guilt It spills itself in fearing to be spilt Ophelia distracted Oph Where is

shroud as the mountain snowKing Queen Alas look here my lord Oph SingsLarded all with sweet flowersWhich bewept to the grave did not goWith truelove showers King How do you pretty lady Oph Well God dild you They say the owl was a baker's daughter Lord we know what we are but know not what we may be God be at your table King Conceit upon her father Oph Pray let's have no words of this but when they ask you what it means say you this Sings Tomorrow is Saint Valentine's day All in the morning bedtime And I a maid at your window To be your Valentine Then up he rose and donn'd his clo'es And dupp'd the chamber door Let in the maid that out a maid Never departed more King Pretty Ophelia Oph Indeed la without an oath I'll make an end on't Sings By Gis and by Saint Charity Alack and fie for shame Young men will do't if they come to't By Cock they are to blame Quoth she 'Before you tumbled me You promis'd me to wed' He answers o would I 'a' done by yonder sun An thou hadst not come to my bed' King How long hath she been thus Oph I hope all will be well We must be patient but I cannot choose but weep to think they would lay him i' th' cold ground My brother shall know of it and so I thank you for your good counsel Come my coach Good night ladies Good night sweet ladies Good night good nightKing Follow her close give her good watch I pray you Horatio O this is the poison of deep grief it springs All from her father's death O Gertrude Gertrude When sorrows come they come not single spies But in battalions First her father slain Next Your son gone and he most violent author Of his own just remove the people muddied Thick and and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers For good Polonius' death and we have done but greenly In huggermugger to inter him Poor Ophelia Divided from herself and her fairjudgment Without the which we are Pictures or mere beasts Last and as such containing as all these Her brother is in secret come from France And wants not buzzers to infect his ear Feeds on his wonder keep himself in clouds With pestilent speeches of his father's death Wherein necessity of matter beggar'd Will nothing stick Our person to arraign In ear and ear O my dear Gertrude this Like to a murd'ring piece in many places Give me superfluous deathA noise within Queen Alack what noise is this King Where are my Switzers Let them guard the door a Messenger What is the matter Mess Save Yourself my lord The ocean overpeering of his list Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste Than Young Laertes in a riotous head O'erbears Your offices The rabble call him lord And as the world were now but to begin Antiquity forgot custom not known The ratifiers and props of every word They cry 'Choose we Laertes shall be king' Caps hands and tongues applaud it to the clouds 'Laertes shall be king Laertes king'A noise within Queen How cheerfully on the false trail they cry O this is counter you false Danish dogs King The doors are brokeLaertes with others Laer Where is this king Sirs staid you all without All No let's come in Laer I pray you give me leave All We will we will Laer I thank you Keep the door his Followers O thou vile king Give me my father Queen Calmly good Laertes Laer That drop of blood that's calm proclaims me bastard Cries cuckold to my father brands the harlot Even here between the chaste unsmirched brows Of my true mother King What is the cause Laertes That thy rebellion looks so giantlike Let him go Gertrude Do not fear our person There's such divinity doth hedge a king That treason can but peep to what it would Acts little of his will Tell me Laertes Why thou art thus incens'd Let him go Gertrude Speak man Laer Where is my father King Dead Queen But not by him King Let him demand his fill Laer How came he dead I'll not be juggled with To hell allegiance vows to the blackest devil Conscience and grace to the profoundest pit I dare damnation To this point I stand That both the world I give to negligence Let come what comes only I'll be reveng'd Most throughly for my father King Who shall stay you Laer My will not all the world And for my means I'll husband them so well They shall go far with little King Good Laertes If you desire to know the certainty Of your dear father's death is't writ in Your revenge That swoopstake you will draw both friend and foe Winner and loser Laer None but his enemies King Will you know them then Laer To his good friends thus wide I'll ope my arms And like the kind liferend'ring pelican Repast them with my blood King Why now You speak Like a good child and a true gentleman That I am guiltless of your father's death And am most sensibly in grief for it It shall as level to your judgment pierce As day does to your eye A noise within 'Let her come in' Laer How now What noise is thatOphelia O heat dry up my brains Tears seven times salt Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye By heaven thy madness shall be paid by weight Till our scale turn the beam O rose of May Dear maid kind sister sweet Ophelia O heavens is't possible a young maid's wits Should be as mortal as an old man's life Nature is fine in love and where 'tis fine It sends some precious instance of itself After the thing it loves Oph singsThey bore him barefac'd on the bierHey non nony nony hey nonyAnd in his grave rain'd many a tear Fare you well my dove Laer Hadst thou thy wits and didst persuade revenge It could not move thus Oph You must sing 'Adown adown and you call him adowna' O how the wheel becomes it It is the false steward that stole his master's daughter Laer This nothing's more than matter Oph There's rosemary that's for remembrance Pray you love remember And there is pansies that's for thoughts Laer A document in madness Thoughts and remembrance fitted Oph There's fennel for you and columbines There's rue for you and here's some for me We may call it herb of grace o' Sundays O you must wear your rue with a difference There's a daisy I would give you some violets but they wither'd all when my father died They say he made a good end Sings For bonny sweet Robin is all my joy Laer Thought and affliction passion hell itself She turns to favour and to prettiness Oph singsAnd will he not come againAnd will he not come againNo no he is deadGo to thy deathbedHe never will come againHis beard was as white as snowAll flaxen was his pollHe is gone he is goneAnd we cast away moanGod 'a'mercy on his soul And of all Christian souls I pray God God b' wi' youLaer Do you see this O God King Laertes I must commune with your grief Or you deny me right Go but apart Make choice of whom your wisest friends you will And they shall hear and judge 'twixt you and me If by direct or by collateral hand They find us touch'd we will our kingdom give Our crown our life and all that we call ours To you in satisfaction but if not Be you content to lend your patience to us And we shall jointly labour with your soul To give it due content Laer Let this be so His means of death his obscure funeral No trophy sword nor hatchment o'er his bones No noble rite nor formal ostentation Cry to be heard as 'twere from heaven to earth That I must call't in question King So you shall And where th' offence is let the great axe fall I pray you go with me
