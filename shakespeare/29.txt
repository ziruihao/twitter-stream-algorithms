took such sorrow That he quit being and his gentle lady Big of this gentleman our theme deceas'd As he was born The King he takes the babe To his protection calls him Posthumus Leonatus Breeds him and

had Most pretty things to say Ere I could tell him How I would think on him at certain hours Such thoughts and such or I could make him swear The shes of Italy should not betray Mine interest and his honour or have charg'd him At the sixth hour of morn at noon at midnight T' encounter me with orisons for then I am in heaven for him or ere I could Give him that parting kiss which I had set Betwixt

dispatch'd I will attend the QueenMadam I shallRomehouseaaand a Believe it sir I have seen him in Britain He was then of a crescent note expected to prove so worthy as since he hath been allowed the name of But I could then have look'd on him without the help of admiration though the catalogue of his endowments had been tabled by his side and I to peruse him by itemsYou speak of him when he was less furnish'd than now he is with that which makes him both without and withinI have seen him in France we had very many there could behold the sun with as firm eyes as heThis matter of marrying his king's daughter wherein he must be weighed rather by her value than his own words him I doubt not a great deal from the matterAnd then his banishmentAy and the approbation of those that weep this lamentable divorce under her colours are wonderfully to extend him be it but to fortify her judgment which else an easy battery might lay flat for taking a beggar without less quality But how comes it he is to sojourn with you How creeps acquaintanceHis father and I were soldiers together to whom I have been often bound for no less than my lifeHere comes the Briton Let him be so tained amongst you as suits with gentlemen of your knowing to a stranger of his quality I beseech you all be better known to this gentleman whom I commend to you as a noble friend of mine How worthy he is I will leave to appear hereafter rather than story him in his own hearingSir we have known together in OrleansSince when I have been debtor to you for courtesies which I will be ever to pay and yet pay stillSir you o'errate my poor kindness I was glad I did atone my countryman and you it had been pity you should have been put together with so mortal a purpose as then each bore upon importance of so slight and trivial a natureBy your pardon sir I was then a young traveller rather shunn'd to go even with what I heard than in my every action to be guided by others' experiences but upon my mended judgment if I offend not to say it is mended my quarrel was not altogether slightFaith yes to be put to the arbitrement of swords and by such two that would by all likelihood have confounded one the other or have fall'n bothCan we with manners ask what was the differenceSafely I think 'Twas a contention in public which may without contradiction suffer the report It was much like an argument that fell out last night where each of us fell in praise of our country mistresses this gentleman at that time vouching and upon warrant of bloody affirmation his to be more fair virtuous wise chaste constant qualified and less attemptable than any the rarest of our ladies in FranceThat lady is not now living or this gentleman's opinion by this worn outShe holds her virtue still and I my mindYou must not so far prefer her fore ours of ItalyBeing so far provok'd as I was in France I would abate her nothing though I profess myself her adorer not her friendAs fair and as good a kind of handinhand comparison had been something too fair and too good for any lady in Britain If she went before others I have seen as that diamond of yours outlustres many I have beheld I could not but believe she excelled many but I have not seen the most precious diamond that is nor you the ladyI prais'd her as I rated her So do I my stoneWhat do you esteem it atMore than the world enjoysEither your unparagon'd mistress is dead or she's outpriz'd by a trifleYou are mistaken the one may be sold or given if there were wealth enough for the purchase or merit for the gift the other is not a thing for sale and only the gift of the godsWhich the gods have given youWhich by their graces I will keepYou may wear her in title yours but you know strange fowl light upon neighbouring ponds Your ring may be stol'n too So your brace of unprizable estimations the one is but frail and the other casual a cunning thief or a thatwayaccomplish'd courtier would hazard the winning both of first and lastYour Italy contains none so accomplish'd a courtier to convince the honour of my mistress if in the holding or loss of that you term her frail I do nothing doubt you have store of thieves notwithstanding I fear not my ringLet us leave here gentlemenSir with all my heart This worthy signior I thank him makes no stranger of me we are familiar at firstWith five times so much conversation I should get ground of your fair mistress make her go back even to the yielding had I admittance and opportunity to friendNo noI dare thereupon pawn the moiety of my estate to your ring which in my opinion o'ervalues it something But I make my wager rather against your confidence than her reputation and to bar your offence herein too I durst attempt it against any lady in the worldYou are a great deal abus'd in too bold a persuasion and I doubt not you sustain what y'are worthy of by your attemptWhat's thatA repulse though your attempt as you call it deserve more a punishment tooGentlemen enough of this It came in too suddenly let it die as it was born and I pray you be better acquaintedWould I had put my estate and my neighbour's on th' approbation of what I have spokeWhat lady would you choose to assailYours whom in constancy you think stands so safe I will lay you ten thousand ducats to your ring that commend me to the court where your lady is with no more advantage than the opportunity of a second conference and I will bring from thence that honour of hers which you imagine so reserv'dI will wage against your gold gold to it My ring I hold dear as my finger 'tis part of itYou are a friend and therein the wiser If you buy ladies' flesh at a million a dram you cannot preserve it from tainting But I see you have some religion in you that you fearThis is but a custom in your tongue you bear a graver purpose I hopeI am the master of my speeches and would undergo what's spoken I swearWill you I Shall but lend my diamond till your return Let there be covenants drawn between's My mistress exceeds in goodness the hugeness of your unworthy thinking I dare you to this match here's my ringI will have it no layBy the gods it is one If I bring you no sufficient testimony that I have enjoy'd the dearest bodily part of your mistress my ten thousand ducats are yours so is your diamond too If I come off and leave her in such honour as you have trust in she your jewel this your jewel and my gold are yours provided I have your commendation for my more free tainmentI embrace these conditions let us have articles betwixt us Only thus far you shall answer if you make your voyage upon her and give me directly to understand you have prevail'd I am no further your enemy she is not worth our debate if she remain unseduc'd you not making it appear otherwise for your ill opinion and th' assault you have made to her chastity you shall answer me with your swordYour hand a covenant We will have these things set down by lawful counsel and straight away for Britain lest the bargain should
