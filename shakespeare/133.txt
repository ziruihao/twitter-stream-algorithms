rejoice so much at the abuse of Falstaff as he will chafe at the doctor's marrying my daughter but 'tis no matter better a little chiding than a great deal of heartbreak Where is Nan now and her troop of fairies and the Welsh devil Hugh They are all couch'd in a pit hard by Heme's oak with obscur'd lights which at the very instant of Falstaff's and our meeting they will at once display to the night That cannot choose but amaze him If he be not amaz'd he will be mock'd if he be amaz'd he will every way be mock'd We'll betray him finely Against such lewdsters and their lechery Those that betray them do no treachery The hour draws on To the oak to the oakWindsor Parklike a satyr with as fairiesTrib trib fairies come and remember your parts Be pold I pray you follow me into the pit and when I give the watchords do as I pid you Come come trib tribAnother part of the Parkdisguised as The Windsor bell hath struck twelve the minute draws on Now the hotblooded gods assist me Remember Jove thou wast a bull for thy Europa love set on thy horns O powerful love that in some respects makes a beast a man in some other a man a beast You were also Jupiter a swan for the love of Leda O omnipotent love how near the god drew to the complexion of a goose A fault done first in the form of a beastO Jove a beastly faultand then another fault in the semblance of a fowl think on't Jove a foul fault When gods have hot backs what shall poor men do For me I am here a Windsor stag and the fattest I think i' th' forest Send me a cool ruttime Jove or who can blame me to piss my tallow Who comes here

come a tempest of provocation I will shelter me hereEmbracing her Mistress Page is come with me sweetheartDivide me like a brib'd buck each a haunch I will keep my sides to myself my shoulders for the fellow of this walk and my horns I bequeath your husbands Am I a woodman ha Speak I like Heme the Hunter Why now is Cupid a child of conscience he makes restitution As I am a true spirit welcome A noise of horns Alas what noise Heaven forgive our sinsWhat should this beAway awayAway awayThey run offI think the devil will not have me damn'd lest the oil that's in me should set hell on fire he would never else cross me thuslike a satyr as a fairy and as the Fairy Queen fairies andHobgoblin all with tapersFairies black grey green and white You moonshine revellers and shades of night You orphan heirs of fixed destiny Attend your office and your quality Crier Hobgoblin make the fairy oyesElves list your names silence you airy toys Cricket to Windsor chimneys shalt thou leap Where fires thou find'st unrak'd and hearths unswept There pinch the maids as blue as bilberry Our radiant Queen hates sluts and slutteryThey are fairies he that speaks to them shall die I'll wink and couch no man their works must eyeLies down upon his faceWhere's Pede Go you and where you find a maid That ere she sleep has thrice her prayers said Raise up the organs of her fantasy Sleep she as sound as careless infancy But those as sleep and think not on their sins Pinch them arms legs backs shoulders sides and shinsAbout about Search Windsor castle elves within and out Strew good luck ouphes on every sacred room That it may stand till the perpetual doom In state as wholesome as in state 'tis fit Worthy the owner and the owner it The several chairs of order look you scour With juice of balm and every precious flower Each fair instalment coat and sev'ral crest With loyal blazon evermore be blest And nightly meadowfairies look you sing Like to the Garter's compass in a ring Th' expressure that it bears green let it be More fertilefresh than all the field to see And 'Honi soit qui mal y pense' write In em'rald tufts flow'rs purple blue and white Like sapphire pearl and rich embroidery Buckled below fair knighthood's bending knee Fairies use flow'rs for their charactery Away disperse but till 'tis one o'clock Our dance of custom round about the oak Of Herne the Hunter let us not forgetPray you lock hand in hand yourselves in order set And twenty glowworms shall our lanterns be To guide our measure round about the tree But stay I smell a man of middle earthHeavens defend me from that Welsh fairy lest he transform me to a piece of cheeseVile worm thou wast o'erlook'd even in thy birthWith trialfire touch me his fingerend If he be chaste the flame will back descend And turn him to no pain but if he start It is the flesh of a corrupted heartA trial comeCome will this wood take fireThey put the tapers to his fingers and he startsOh oh ohCorrupt corrupt and tainted in desire About him fairies sing a scornful rhyme And as you trip still pinch him to your timeFie on sinful fantasy Fie on lust and luxury Lust is but a bloody fire Kindled with unchaste desire Fed in heart whose flames aspire As thoughts do blow them higher and higher Pinch him fairies mutually Pinch him for his villainy Pinch him and burn him and turn him about Till candles and starlight and moonshine be out During this song they pinch comes one way and steals away a fairy in green another way and takes off a fairy in white and steals awayA noise of hunting is heard within All the fairies run away pulls off his buck's head and rises and Nay do not fly I think we have watch'd you now Will none but Heme the Hunter serve your turn I pray you come hold up the jest no higher Now good Sir John how like you Windsor wives See you these husband Do not these fair yokes Become the forest better than the townNow sir who's a cuckold now Master Brook Falstaff's a knave a cuckoldly knave here are his horns Master Brook and Master Brook he hath enjoyed nothing of Ford's but his buckbasket his cudgel and twenty pounds of money which must be paid to Master Brook his horses are arrested for it Master Brook Sir John we have had ill luck we could never meet I will never take you for my love again but I will always count you my deerI do begin to perceive that I am made an assAy and an ox too both the proofs are extantAnd these are not fairies I was three or four times in the thought they were not fairies and yet the guiltiness of my mind the sudden surprise of my powers drove the grossness of the foppery into a receiv'd belief in despite of the teeth of all rhyme and reason that they were fairies See now how wit may be made a JackaLent when 'tis upon ill employmentSir John Falstaff serve Got and leave your desires and fairies will not pinse youWell said fairy HughAnd leave you your jealousies too I pray youI will never mistrust my wife again till thou art able to woo her in good EnglishHave I laid my brain in the sun and dried it that it wants matter to prevent so gross o'erreaching as this Am I ridden with a Welsh goat too Shall I have a coxcomb of frieze 'Tis time I were chok'd with a piece of toasted cheeseSeese is not good to give putter your belly is all puttereese' and 'putter' Have I liv'd to stand at the taunt of one that makes fritters of English This is enough to be the decay of lust and latewalking through the realm Why Sir John do you think though we would have thrust virtue out of our hearts by the head and shoulders and have given ourselves without scruple to hell that ever the devil could have made you our delightWhat a hodgepudding a bag of flax A puff'd manOld cold wither'd and of intolerable entrailsAnd one that is as slanderous as SatanAnd as poor as JobAnd as wicked as his wifeAnd given to fornications and to taverns and sack and wine and metheglins and to drinkings and swearings and starings pribbles and prabblesWell I am your theme you have the start of me I am dejected I am not able to answer the Welsh flannel ignorance itself is a plummet o'er me use me as you willMarry sir we'll bring you to Windsor to one Master Brook that you have cozen'd of money to whom you should have been a pander Over and above that you have suffer'd I think to repay that money will be a biting afflictionYet be
