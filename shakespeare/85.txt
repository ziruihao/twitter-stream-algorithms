her businessThat I can tell you too The Archbishop Of Canterbury accompanied with other Learned and reverend fathers of his order Held a late court at Dunstable six miles of From Ampthill where the Princess lay to which She was often cited by them but appear'd not And to be short for not appearance and The King's late scruple by the main assent Of all these learned men she was divorc'd And the

more of that Procession with a great flourish of trumpets a thirdGod save you sir Where have you been broilingAmong the crowds i' th' Abbey where a finger Could not be wedg'd in more I am stifled With the mere rankness of their joyYou saw The ceremonyThat I didHow was itWell worth the seeingGood sir speak it to usAs well as I am able The rich stream Of lords and ladies having brought the Queen To a prepar'd place in the choir fell of A distance from her while her Grace sat down To rest awhile some half an hour or so In a rich chair of state opposing freely The beauty of her person to the people Believe me sir she is the goodliest woman That ever lay by man which when the people Had the full view of such a noise arose As the shrouds make at sea in a stiff tempest As loud and to as many tunes hats cloaks Doublets I thinkflew up and had their faces Been loose this day they had been lost Such joy I never saw before Greatbellied women That had not half a week to go like rams In the old time of war would shake the press And make 'em reel before 'em No man living Could say 'This is my wife' there all were woven So strangely in one pieceBut what follow'dAt length her Grace rose and with modest paces Came to the altar where she kneel'd and saintlike Cast her fair eyes to heaven and pray'd devoutly Then rose again and bow'd her to the people When by the Archbishop of Canterbury She had all the royal makings of a queen As holy oil Edward Confessor's crown The rod and bird of peace and all such emblems Laid nobly on her which perform'd the choir With all the choicest music of the kingdom Together sung 'Te Deum' So she parted And with the same full state pac'd back again To York Place where the feast is heldSir You must no more call it York Place that's past For since the Cardinal fell that title's lost 'Tis now the King's and called WhitehallI know it But 'tis so lately alter'd that the old name Is fresh about meWhat two reverend bishops Were those that went on each side of the QueenStokesly and Gardiner the one of Winchester Newly preferr'd from the King's secretary The other LondonHe of Winchester Is held no great good lover of the Archbishop's The virtuous CranmerAll the land knows that However yet there is no great breach When it comes Cranmer will find a friend will not shrink from himWho may that be I pray youThomas Cromwell A man in much esteem with th' King and truly A worthy friend The King has made him Master O' th' jewel House And one already of the Privy CouncilHe will deserve moreYes without all doubt Come gentlemen ye shall go my way which Is to th' court and there ye shall be my guests Something I can command As I walk thither I'll tell ye moreYou may command us sir Kimbolton Dowager sick led betweenher Gentleman Usher andher womanHow does your GraceO Griffith sick to death My legs like loaden branches bow to th' earth Willing to leave their burden Reach a chair Sonow methinks I feel a little ease Didst thou not tell me Griffith as thou led'st me That the great child of honour Cardinal Wolsey Was deadYes madam but I think your Grace Out of the pain you suffer'd gave no ear to'tPrithee good Griffith tell me how he died If well he stepp'd before me happily For my exampleWell the voice goes madam For after the stout Earl Northumberland Arrested him at York and brought him forward As a man sorely tainted to his answer He fell sick suddenly and grew so ill He could not sit his muleAlas poor manAt last with easy roads he came to Leicester Lodg'd in the abbey where the reverend abbot With all his covent honourably receiv'd him To whom he gave these words 'O father Abbot An old man broken with the storms of state Is come to lay his weary bones among ye Give him a little earth for charity' So went to bed where eagerly his sickness Pursu'd him still And three nights after this About the hour of eightwhich he himself Foretold should be his lastfull of repentance Continual meditations tears and sorrows He gave his honours to the world again His blessed part to heaven and slept in peaceSo may he rest his faults lie gently on him Yet thus far Griffith give me leave to speak him And yet with charity He was a man Of an unbounded stomach ever ranking Himself with princes one that by suggestion Tied all the kingdom Simony was fair play His own opinion was his law I' th' presence He would say untruths and be ever double Both in his words and meaning He was never But where he meant to ruin pitiful His promises were as he then was mighty But his performance as he is now nothing Of his own body he was ill and gave The clergy ill exampleNoble madam Men's evil manners live in brass their virtues We write in water May it please your Highness To hear me speak his good nowYes good Griffith I were malicious elseThis Cardinal Though from an humble stock undoubtedly Was fashion'd to much honour from his cradle He was a scholar and a ripe and good one Exceeding wise fairspoken and persuading Lofty and sour to them that lov'd him not But to those men that sought him sweet as summer And though he were unsatisfied in getting Which was a sinyet in bestowing madam He was most princely ever witness for him Those twins of learning that he rais'd in you Ipswich and Oxford One of which fell with him Unwilling to outlive the good that did it The other though unfinish'd yet so famous So excellent in art and still so rising That Christendom shall ever speak his virtue His overthrow heap'd happiness upon him For then and not till then he felt himself And found the blessedness of being little And to add greater honours to his age Than man could give him he died fearing GodAfter my death I wish no other herald No other speaker of my living actions To keep mine honour from corruption But such an honest chronicler as Griffith Whom I most hated living thou hast made me With thy religious truth and modesty Now in his ashes honour Peace be with him patience be near me still and set me lower I have not long to trouble thee Good Griffith Cause the musicians play me that sad note I nam'd my knell whilst I sit meditating On that celestial harmony I go to Sad and solemn musicShe is asleep Good wench let's sit down quiet For fear we wake her Softly gentle Patiencesolemnly tripping one after another six clad in white robes wearing on their heads garlands of bays and golden vizards on their faces branches of bays or palm in their hands They first congee unto her then dance and at certain changes the first two hold a spare garland over her head at which the other four make reverent curtsies Then the two that held the garland deliver the same to the other next two who observe the same order in their changes and holding the garland over her head which done they deliver the same garland to the last two who likewise observe the same order at which as it were by inspiration she makes in her sleep signs of rejoicing and holdeth up her hands to heaven And so in their dancing vanish carrying the garland with them The music continuesSpirits of peace where are ye Are ye all gone And leave me here in wretchedness behind yeMadam we are hereIt is not you I call for Saw ye nonesince I sleptNone madamNo Saw you not even now a blessed troop Invite me to a banquet whose bright faces Cast thousand beams upon me like the sun They promis'd me eternal happiness And brought me garlands Griffith which I feel I am not worthy yet to wear I shall assuredlyI am most joyful madam such good dreams Possess your fancyBid the music leave They are harsh and heavy to meMusic ceasesDo you note How much her Grace is alter'd on the sudden How long her face is drawn How pale she looks And of an earthly cold Mark her eyesShe is going wench Pray prayHeaven comfort her a An't like your GraceYou are a saucy fellow Deserve we no more reverenceYou are to blame Knowing she will not lose her wonted greatness To use so rude behaviour Go to kneelI humbly do entreat your Highness' pardon My haste made me

entreats you take good comfortO my good lord that comfort comes too late 'Tis like a pardon after execution That gentle physic given in time had cur'd me But now I am past all comforts here but prayers How does his HighnessMadam in good healthSo may he ever do and ever flourish When I shall dwell with worms and my poor name Banish'd the kingdom Patience is that letter I caus'd you write yet sent awayNo madam Giving it to Sir I most humbly pray you to deliver This to my lord the KingMost willing madamIn which I have commended to his goodness The model of our chaste loves his young daughter The dews of heaven fall thick in blessings on her Beseeching him to give her virtuous breeding She is young and of a noble modest nature I hope she will deserve welland a little To love her
