 SceneThe street near Leonato's houseLeonato and his brotherAntonio Ant If you go on thus you will kill yourself And 'tis not wisdom thus to second grief Against yourself Leon I pray thee cease thy counsel Which falls into mine ears as profitless As water in a sieve Give not me counsel Nor let no comforter delight mine ear But such a one whose wrongs do suit with mine Bring me a father that so lov'd his child Whose joy of her is overwhelm'd like mine And bid him speak to me of patience Measure his woe the length and breadth of mine And let it answer every strain for strain As thus for thus and such a grief for such In every lineament branch shape and form If such a one will smile and stroke his beard Bid sorrow wag cry 'hem' when he should groan Patch grief with proverbs make misfortune drunk With candlewastersbring him yet to me And I of him will gather patience But there is no such man for brother men Can counsel and speak comfort to that grief Which they themselves not feel but tasting it Their counsel turns to passion which before Would give preceptial medicine to rage Fetter strong madness in a silken thread Charm ache with air and agony with words No no 'Tis all men's office to speak patience To those that wring under the load of sorrow But no man's virtue nor sufficiency To be so moral when he shall endure The like himself Therefore give me no counsel My griefs cry louder than advertisement Ant Therein do men from children nothing differ Leon I pray thee peace I will be flesh and blood For there was never yet philosopher That could endure the toothache patiently However they have writ the style of gods And made a push at chance and sufferance Ant Yet bend not all the harm upon yourself Make those that do offend you suffer too Leon There thou speak'st reason Nay I will do so My soul doth tell me Hero is belied And that shall Claudio know so shall the Prince And all of them that thus dishonour herDon Pedro and Claudio Ant Here comes the Prince and Claudio hastily Pedro Good den Good den Claud Good day to both of you Leon Hear you my lords Pedro We have some haste Leonato Leon Some haste my lord well fare you well my lord Are you so hasty now Well all is one Pedro Nay do not quarrel with us good old man Ant If he could right himself with quarrelling Some of us would lie low Claud Who wrongs him Leon Marry thou dost wrong me thou dissembler thou Nay never lay thy hand upon thy sword I fear thee not Claud Mary beshrew my hand If it should give your age such cause of fear In faith my hand meant nothing to my sword Leon Tush tush man never fleer and jest at me I speak not like a dotard nor a fool As under privilege of age to brag What I have done being young or what would do Were I not old Know Claudio to thy head Thou hast so wrong'd mine innocent child and me That I am forc'd to lay my reverence by And with grey hairs and bruise of many days Do challenge thee to trial of a man I say thou hast belied mine innocent child Thy slander hath gone through and through her heart And she lied buried with her ancestors O in a tomb where never scandal slept Save this of hers fram'd by thy villany Claud My villany Leon Thine Claudio thine I say Pedro You say not right old man Leon My lord my lord I'll prove it on his body if he dare Despite his nice fence and his active practice His May of youth and bloom of lustihood Claud Away I will not have to do with you Leon Canst thou so daff me Thou hast kill'd my child If thou kill'st me boy thou shalt kill a man And He shall kill two of us and men indeed But that's no matter let him kill one first Win me and wear me Let him answer me Come follow me boy Come sir boy come follow me Sir boy I'll whip you from your foining fence Nay as I am a gentleman I will Leon Brother Ant Content yourself God knows I lov'd my niece And she is dead slander'd to death by villains That dare as well answer a man indeed As I dare take a serpent by the tongue Boys apes braggarts jacks milksops Leon Brother Anthony Ant Hold you content What man I know them yea And what they weigh even to the utmost scruple Scambling outfacing fashionmonging boys That lie and cog and flout deprave and slander Go anticly show outward hideousness And speak off half a dozen dang'rous words How they might hurt their enemies if they durst And this is all Leon But brother Anthony Ant Come 'tis no matter Do not you meddle let me deal in this Pedro Gentlemen both we will not wake your patience My heart is sorry for your daughter's death But on my honour she was charg'd with nothing But what was true and very full of proof Leon My lord my lord Pedro I will not hear you Leon No Come brother awayI will be heard Ant And shall or some of us will smart for itamboBenedick Pedro See see Here comes the man we went to seek Claud Now signior what news Bene Good day my lord Pedro Welcome signior You are almost come to part almost a fray Claud We had lik'd to have had our two noses snapp'd off with two old men without teeth Pedro Leonato and his brother What think'st thou Had we fought I doubt we should have been too young for them Bene In a false quarrel there is no true valour I came to seek you both Claud We have been up and down to seek thee for we are highproof melancholy and would fain have it beaten away Wilt thou use thy wit Bene It is in my scabbard Shall I draw it Pedro Dost thou wear thy wit by thy side Claud Never any did so though very many have been beside their wit I will bid thee draw as we do the minstreldraw to pleasure us Pedro As I am an honest man he looks pale Art thou sick or angry Claud What courage man What though care kill'd a cat thou hast mettle enough in thee to kill care Bene Sir I shall meet your wit in the career an you charge it against me I pray you choose another subject Claud Nay then give him another staff this last was broke cross Pedro By this light he changes more and more I think he be angry indeed Claud If he be he knows how to turn his girdle Bene Shall I speak a word in your ear Claud God bless me from a challenge Bene aside to Claudio You are a villain I jest not I will make it good how you dare with what you dare and when you dare Do me right or I will protest your cowardice You have kill'd a sweet lady and her death shall fall heavy on you Let me hear from you Claud Well I will meet you so I may have good cheer Pedro What a feast a feast Claud I' faith I thank him he hath bid me to a calve's head and a capon the which if I do not carve most curiously say my knife's naught Shall I not find a woodcock too Bene Sir your wit ambles well it goes easily Pedro I'll tell thee how Beatrice prais'd thy wit the other day I said thou hadst a fine wit 'True' said she 'a fine little one' 'No' said I 'a great wit' 'Right' says she 'a great gross one' 'Nay' said I 'a good wit' 'Just' said she 'it hurts nobody' 'Nay' said I 'the gentleman is wise' 'Certain' said she a wise gentleman' 'Nay' said I 'he hath the tongues' 'That I believe' said she 'for he swore a thing to me on Monday night which he forswore on Tuesday morning There's a double tongue there's two tongues' Thus did she an hour together transshape thy particular virtues Yet at last she concluded with a sigh thou wast the proper'st man in Italy Claud For the which she wept heartily and said she cared not Pedro Yea that she did but yet for all that an if she did not hate him deadly she would love him dearly The old man's daughter told us all Claud All all and moreover God saw him when he was hid in the garden Pedro But when shall we set the savage bull's horns on the sensible Benedick's head Claud Yea and text underneath 'Here dwells Benedick the married man' Bene Fare you well boy you know my mind I will leave you now to your gossiplike humour You break jests as braggards do their blades which God be thanked hurt not My lord for your many courtesies I thank you I must discontinue your company Your brother the bastard is fled from Messina You have among you kill'd a sweet and innocent lady For my Lord Lackbeard there he and I shall meet and till then peace be with him Pedro He is in earnest Claud In most profound earnest and I'll warrant you for the love of Beatrice Pedro And hath challeng'd thee Claud Most sincerely Pedro What a pretty thing man is when he goes in his doublet and hose and leaves off his witConstables Dogberry and Verges with the Watch leading Conrade and Borachio Claud He is then a giant to an ape but then is an ape a doctor to such a man Pedro But soft you let me be Pluck up my heart and be sad Did he not say my brother was fled Dog Come you sir If justice cannot tame you she shall ne'er weigh more reasons in her balance Nay an you be a cursing hypocrite once you must be look'd to Pedro How now two of my brother's men bound Borachio one Claud Hearken after their offence my lord Pedro Officers what offence have these men done Dog Marry sir they have committed false report moreover they have spoken untruths secondarily they are slanders sixth and lastly they have belied a lady thirdly they have verified unjust things and to conclude they are lying knaves Pedro First I ask thee what they have done thirdly I ask thee what's their offence sixth and lastly why they are committed and to conclude what you lay to their charge Claud Rightly reasoned and in his own division and by my troth there's one meaning well suited Pedro Who have you offended masters that you are thus bound to your answer This learned constable is too cunning to be understood What's your offence Bora Sweet Prince let me go no farther to mine answer Do you hear me and let this Count kill me I have deceived even your very eyes What your wisdoms could not discover these shallow fools have brought to light who in the night overheard me confessing to this man how Don John your brother incensed me to slander the Lady Hero how you were brought into the orchard and saw me court Margaret in Hero's garments how you disgrac'd her when you should marry her My villany they have upon record which I had rather seal with my death than repeat over to my shame The lady is dead upon mine and my master's false accusation and briefly I desire nothing but the reward of a villain Pedro Runs not this speech like iron through your blood Claud I have drunk poison whiles he utter'd it Pedro But did my brother set thee on to this Bora Yea and paid me richly for the practice of it Pedro He is compos'd and fram'd of treachery And fled he is upon this villany Claud Sweet Hero now thy image doth appear In the rare semblance that I lov'd it first Dog Come bring away the plaintiffs By this time our sexton hath reformed Signior Leonato of the matter And masters do not forget to specify when time and place shall serve that I am an ass Verg Here here comes Master Signior Leonato and the sexton tooLeonato his brother Antonio and the Sexton Leon Which is the villain Let me see his eyes That when I note another man like him I may avoid him Which of these is he Bora If you would know your wronger look on me Leon Art thou the slave that with thy breath hast kill'd Mine

Record it with your high and worthy deeds 'Twas bravely done if you bethink you of it Claud I know not how to pray your patience Yet I must speak Choose your revenge yourself Impose me to what penance your invention Can lay upon my sin Yet sinn'd I not But in mistaking Pedro By my soul nor I And yet to satisfy this good old man I would bend under any heavy weight That he'll enjoin me to Leon I cannot bid you bid my daughter live That were impossible but I pray you both Possess the people in Messina here How innocent she died and if your love Can labour aught in sad invention Hang her an epitaph upon her tomb And sing it to her bonessing it tonight Tomorrow morning come you to my house And since you could not be my soninlaw Be yet my nephew My brother hath a daughter Almost the copy of my child that's dead And she alone is heir to both of us Give her the right you should have giv'n her cousin And so dies my revenge Claud O noble sir Your overkindness doth wring tears from me I do embrace your offer and dispose For henceforth of poor Claudio Leon Tomorrow then I will expect your coming Tonight I take my leave This naughty man Shall fact to face be brought to Margaret Who I believe was pack'd in all this wrong Hir'd to it by your brother Bora No by my soul she was not Nor knew not what she did when she spoke to me But always hath been just and virtuous In anything that I do know by her Dog Moreover sir which indeed is not under white and black this plaintiff here the offender did call me ass I beseech you let it be rememb'red in his punishment And also the watch heard them talk of one Deformed They say he wears a key in his ear and a lock hanging by it and borrows money in God's name the which he hath us'd so long and never paid that now men grow hardhearted and will lend nothing for God's sake Pray you examine him upon that point Leon I thank thee for thy care and honest pains Dog Your worship speaks like a most thankful and reverent youth and I praise God for you Leon There's for thy pains Gives money Dog God save the foundation Leon Go I discharge thee of thy prisoner and I thank thee Dog I leave an arrant knave with your worship which I beseech your worship to correct yourself for the example of others God keep your worship I wish your worship well God restore you to health I humbly give you leave to depart and if a merry meeting may be wish'd God prohibit it Come neighbour Dogberry and Verges Leon Until tomorrow morning lords farewell Ant Farewell my lords We look for you tomorrow Pedro We will not fall Claud Tonight I'll mourn with Hero Don Pedro and Claudio Leon to the Watch Bring you these fellows onWe'll talk with Margaret How her acquaintance grew with this lewd fellowSceneLeonato's orchardBenedick and Margaret meeting Bene Pray thee sweet Mistress Margaret deserve well at my hands by helping me to the speech of Beatrice Marg Will you then write me a sonnet in praise of my beauty Bene In so high a style Margaret that no man living shall come over it for in most comely truth thou deservest it Marg To have no man come over me Why shall I always keep below stairs Bene Thy wit is as quick as the greyhound's mouthit catches Marg And yours as blunt as the fencer's foils which hit but hurt not Bene A most manly wit Margaret it will not hurt a woman And so I pray thee call Beatrice I give thee the bucklers Marg Give us the swords we have bucklers of our own Bene If you use them Margaret you must put in the pikes with a vice and they are dangerous weapons for maids Marg Well I will call Beatrice to you who I think hath legs Bene And therefore will comeMargaretSings The god of loveThat sits aboveAnd knows me and knows meHow pitiful I deserve I mean in singing but in loving Leander the good swimmer Troilus the first employer of panders and a whole book full of these quondam carpetmongers whose names yet run smoothly in the even road of a blank versewhy they were never so truly turn'd over and over as my poor self in love Marry I cannot show it in rhyme I have tried I can find out no rhyme to 'lady' but 'baby' an innocent rhyme for 'scorn' 'horn'a hard rhyme for 'school' 'fool'a babbling rhyme very ominous endings No I was not born under a rhyming planet nor cannot woo in festival termsBeatrice Sweet Beatrice wouldst thou come when I call'd thee Beat Yea signior and depart when you bid me Bene O stay but till then Beat 'Then' is spoken Fare you well now And yet ere I go let me go with that I came for which is with knowing what hath pass'd between you and Claudio Bene Only foul words and thereupon I will kiss thee Beat Foul words is but foul wind and foul wind is but foul breath and foul breath is noisome Therefore I will depart unkiss'd Bene Thou hast frighted the word out of his right sense so forcible is thy wit But I must tell thee plainly Claudio undergoes my challenge and either I must shortly hear from him or I will subscribe him a coward And I pray thee now tell me for which of my bad parts didst thou first fall in love with me Beat For them all together which maintain'd so politic a state of evil that they will not admit any good part to intermingle with them But for which of my good parts did you first suffer love for me Bene Suffer lovea good epithet I do suffer love indeed for I love thee against my will Beat In spite of your heart I think Alas poor heart If you spite it for my sake I will spite it for yours for I will never love that which my friend hates Bene Thou and I are too wise to woo peaceably Beat It appears not in this confession There's not one wise man among twenty that will praise himself Bene An old an old instance Beatrice that liv'd in the time of good neighbours If a man do not erect in this age his own tomb ere he dies he shall live no longer in monument than the bell rings and the widow weeps Beat And how long is that think you Bene Question why an hour in clamour and a quarter in rheum Therefore is it most expedient for the wise if Don Worm his conscience find no impediment to the contrary to be the trumpet of his own virtues as I am to myself So much for praising myself who I myself will bear witness is praiseworthy And now tell me how doth your cousin Beat Very ill Bene And how do you Beat Very ill too Bene Serve God love me and mend There will I leave you too for here comes one in haste Ursula Urs Madam you must come to your uncle Yonder's old coil at home It is proved my Lady Hero hath been falsely accus'd the Prince and Claudio mightily abus'd and Don John is the author of all who is fled and gone Will you come presently Beat Will you go hear this news signior Bene I will live in thy heart die in thy lap and be buried thy eyes and moreover I will go with thee to thy uncle'sSceneA churchyardClaudio Don Pedro and three or four with tapers followed by Musicians Claud Is this the monument of Leonato Lord It is my lord Claud reads from a scroll Epitaph Done to death by slanderous tongues Was the Hero that here lies Death in guerdon of her wrongs Gives her fame which never dies So the life that died with shame Lives in death with glorious fame Hang thou there upon the tomb Hangs up the scroll Praising her when I am dumb Now music sound and sing your solemn hymnSong Pardon goddess of the night Those that slew thy virgin knight For the which with songs of woe Round about her tomb they go Midnight assist our moan Help us to sigh and groan Heavily heavily Graves yawn and yield your dead Till death be uttered Heavily heavily Claud Now unto thy bones good night Yearly will I do this rite Pedro Good morrow masters Put your torches out The wolves have prey'd and look the gentle day Before the wheels of Phoebus round about Dapples the drowsy east with spots of grey Thanks to you all and leave us Fare you well Claud Good morrow masters Each his several way Pedro Come let us hence and put on other weeds And then to Leonato's we will go Claud And Hymen now with luckier issue speeds Than this for whom we rend'red up this woeSceneThe hall in Leonato's houseLeonato Benedick Beatrice Margaret Ursula Antonio Friar Francis Hero Friar Did I not tell you she was innocent Leon So are the Prince and Claudio who accus'd her Upon the error that you heard debated But Margaret was in some fault for this Although against her will as it appears In the true course of all the question Ant Well I am glad that all things sort so well Bene And so am I being else by faith enforc'd To call young Claudio to a reckoning for it Leon Well daughter and you gentlewomen all Withdraw into a chamber by yourselves And when I send for you come hither mask'dLadies The Prince and Claudio promis'd by this hour To visit me You know your office brother You must be father to your brother's daughter And give her to young Claudio Ant Which I will do with confirm'd countenance Bene Friar I must entreat your pains I think Friar To do what signior Bene To bind me or undo meone of them Signior Leonato truth it is good signior Your niece regards me with an eye of favour Leon That eye my daughter lent her 'Tis most true Bene And I do with an eye of love requite her Leon The sight whereof I think you had from me From Claudio and the Prince but what's your will Bene Your answer sir is enigmatical But for my will my will is your good will May stand with ours this day to be conjoin'd In the state of honourable marriage In which good friar I shall desire your help Leon My heart is with your liking Friar And my help Don Pedro and Claudio and two or three other Here comes the Prince and Claudio Pedro Good morrow to this fair assembly Leon Good morrow Prince good morrow Claudio We here attend you Are you yet determin'd Today to marry with my brother's daughter Claud I'll hold my mind were she an Ethiope Leon Call her forth brother Here's the friar ready Antonio Pedro Good morrow Benedick Why what's the matter That you have such a February face So full of frost of storm and cloudiness Claud I think he thinks upon the savage bull Tush fear not man We'll tip thy horns with gold And all Europa shall rejoice at thee As once Europa did at lusty Jove When he would play the noble beast in love Bene Bull Jove sir had an amiable low And some such strange bull leap'd your father's cow And got a calf in that same noble feat Much like to you for you have just his bleat Leonato's brother Antonio Hero Beatrice Margaret Ursula the ladies wearing masks Claud For this I owe you Here comes other reckonings Which is the lady I must seize upon Ant This same is she and I do give you her Claud Why then she's mine Sweet let me see your face Leon No that you shall not till you take her hand Before this friar and swear to marry her Claud Give me your hand before this holy friar I am your husband if you like of me Hero And when I liv'd I was your other wife Unmasks And when you lov'd you were my other husband Claud Another Hero Hero Nothing certainer One Hero died defil'd but I do live And surely as I live I am a maid Pedro The former Hero Hero that is dead Leon She died my lord but whiles her slander liv'd Friar All this amazement can I qualify When after that the holy rites are ended I'll tell you largely of fair Hero's death Meantime let wonder seem familiar And to the chapel let us presently Bene Soft and fair friar Which is Beatrice Beat unmasks I answer to that name What is your will Bene Do not you love me Beat Why no no more than reason Bene Why then your uncle and the Prince and Claudio Have been deceived for they swore you did Beat Do not you love me Bene Troth no no more than reason Beat Why then my cousin Margaret and Ursula Are much deceiv'd for they did swear you did Bene They swore that you were almost sick for me Beat They swore that you were wellnigh dead for me Bene 'Tis no such matter Then you do not love me Beat No truly but in friendly recompense Leon Come cousin I am sure you love the gentleman Claud And I'll be sworn upon't that he loves her For here's a paper written in his hand A halting sonnet of his own pure brain Fashion'd to Beatrice Hero And here's another Writ in my cousin's hand stol'n from her pocket Containing her affection unto Benedick Bene A miracle Here's our own hands against our hearts Come I will have thee but by this light I take thee for pity Beat I would not deny you but by this good day I yield upon great persuasion and partly to save your life for I was told you were in a consumption Bene Peace I will stop your mouth Kisses her Beat I'll tell thee what Prince a college of witcrackers cannot flout me out of my humour Dost thou think I care for a satire or an epigram No If a man will be beaten with brains 'a shall wear nothing handsome about him In brief since I do purpose to marry I will think nothing to any purpose that the world can say against it and therefore never flout at me for what I have said against it for man is a giddy thing and this is my conclusion For thy part Claudio I did think to have beaten thee but in that thou art like to be my kinsman live unbruis'd and love my cousin Claud I had well hop'd thou wouldst have denied Beatrice that I might have cudgell'd thee out of thy single life to make thee a doubledealer which out of question thou wilt be if my cousin do not look exceeding narrowly to thee Bene Come come we are friends Let's have a dance ere we are married that we may lighten our own hearts and our wives' heels Leon We'll have dancing afterward Bene First of my word Therefore play music Prince thou art sad Get thee a wife get thee a wife There is no staff more reverent than one tipp'd with horn Messenger Mess My lord your brother John is ta'en in flight And brought with armed men back to Messina Bene Think not on him till tomorrow I'll devise thee brave punishments for him Strike up pipers Dance
