myself I hate you which I had rather You felt than make't my boastYou sin against Obedience which you owe your father For The contract you pretend with that base wretch One bred of alms and foster'd with cold dishes With scraps o' th' court it is no contract none And though it be allowed in meaner parties Yet who than he more mean to knit their souls On whom there is no more dependency But brats and beggary in selffigur'd knot Yet you are curb'd from that enlargement by The consequence o' th' crown and must not foil The precious note of it with a base slave A hilding for a livery a squire's cloth A pantler not so eminentProfane fellow Wert thou the son of Jupiter and no more But what thou art besides thou wert too base To be his groom Thou wert dignified enough Even to the point of envy

To win the King as I am bold her honour Will remain hersWhat means do you make to himNot any but abide the change of time Quake in the present winter's state and wish That warmer days would come In these fear'd hopes I barely gratify your love they failing I must die much your debtorYour very goodness and your company O'erpays all I can do By this your king Hath heard of great Augustus Caius Lucius Will do's commission throughly and I think He'll grant the tribute send th' arrearages Or look upon our Romans whose remembrance Is yet fresh in their griefI do believe Statist though I am none nor like to be That this will prove a war and you shall hear The legions now in Gallia sooner landed In our notfearing Britain than have tidings Of any penny tribute paid Our countrymen Are men more order'd than when Julius Caesar Smil'd at their lack of skill but found their courage Worthy his frowning at Their discipline Now mingled with their courages will make known To their approvers they are people such That mend upon the worldSee IachimoThe swiftest harts have posted you by land And winds of all the comers kiss'd your sails To make your vessel nimbleWelcome sirI hope the briefness of your answer made The speediness of your returnYour lady Is one of the fairest that I have look'd uponAnd therewithal the best or let her beauty Look through a casement to allure false hearts And be false with themHere are letters for youTheir tenour good I trust'Tis very likeWas Caius Lucius in the Britain court When you were thereHe was expected then But not approach'dAll is well yet Sparkles this stone as it was wont or is't not Too dull for your good wearingIf I have lost it I should have lost the worth of it in gold I'll make a journey twice as far t' enjoy A second night of such sweet shortness which Was mine in Britain for the ring is wonThe stone's too hard to come byNot a whit Your lady being so easyMake not sir Your loss your sport I hope you know that we Must not continue friendsGood sir we must If you keep covenant Had I not brought The knowledge of your mistress home I grant We were to question farther but I now Profess myself the winner of her honour Together with your ring and not the wronger Of her or you having proceeded but By both your willsIf you can make't apparent That you have tasted her in bed my hand And ring is yours If not the foul opinion You had of her pure honour gains or loses Your sword or mine or masterless leaves both To who shall find themSir my circumstances Being so near the truth as I will make them Must first induce you to believe whose strength I will confirm with oath which I doubt not You'll give me leave to spare when you shall find You need it notProceedFirst her bedchamber Where I confess I slept not but profess Had that was well worth watchingit was hang'd With tapestry of silk and silver the story Proud Cleopatra when she met her Roman And Cydnus swell'd above the banks or for The press of boats or pride A piece of work So bravely done so rich that it did strive In workmanship and value which I wonder'd Could be so rarely and exactly wrought Since the true life on't wasThis is true And this you might have heard of here by me Or by some otherMore particulars Must justify my knowledgeSo they must Or do your honour injuryThe chimney Is south the chamber and the chimneypiece Chaste Dian bathing Never saw I figures So likely to report themselves The cutter Was as another nature dumb outwent her Motion and breath left outThis is a thing Which you might from relation likewise reap Being as it is much spoke ofThe roof o' th' chamber With golden cherubins is fretted her andirons I had forgot them were two winking Cupids Of silver each on one foot standing nicely Depending on their brandsThis is her honour Let it be granted you have seen all this and praise Be given to your remembrance the description Of what is in her chamber nothing saves The wager you have laidThen if you canShows the bracelet Be pale I beg but leave to air this jewel See And now 'tis up again It must be married To that your diamond I'll keep themJove Once more let me behold it Is it that Which I left with herSir I thank her that She stripp'd it from her arm I see her yet Her pretty action did outsell her gift And yet enrich'd it too She gave it me and said She priz'd it onceMay be she pluck'd it of To send it meShe writes so to you doth sheO no no no 'tis true Here take this too Gives the ring It is a basilisk unto mine eye Kills me to look on't Let there be no honour Where there is beauty truth where semblance love Where there's another man The vows of women Of no more bondage be to where they are made Than they are to their virtues which is nothing O above measure falseHave patience sir And take your ring again 'tis not yet won It may be probable she lost it or Who knows if one her women being corrupted Hath stol'n it from herVery true And so I hope he came by't Back my ring Render to me some corporal sign about her More evident than this for this was stol'nBy Jupiter I had it from her armHark you he swears by Jupiter he swears 'Tis true nay keep the ring 'tis true I am sure She would not lose it Her attendants are All sworn and honourable they induc'd to steal it And by a stranger No he hath enjoy'd her The cognizance of her incontinency Is this she hath bought the name of whore thus dearly There take thy hire and all the fiends of hell Divide themselves between youSir be patient This is not strong enough to be believ'd Of one persuaded well ofNever talk on't She hath been colted by himIf you seek For further satisfying under her breast Worthy the pressing lies a mole right proud Of that most delicate lodging By my life I kiss'd it and it gave me present hunger To feed again though full You do remember This stain upon herAy and it doth confirm Another stain as big as hell can hold Were there no more but itWill you hear moreSpare your arithmetic never count the turns Once and a millionI'll be swornNo swearing If you will swear you have not done't you lie And I will kill thee if thou dost deny Thou'st made me cuckoldI'll deny nothingO that I had her here to tear her limbmeal I will go there and do't i' th' court before Her father I'll do somethingQuite besides The government of patience You have won Let's follow him and pervert the present wrath He hath against himselfWith all my heart Rome Another room inhouseIs there no way for men to be but women Must be halfworkers We are all bastards And that most venerable man which I Did call my father was I know not where When I was stamp'd Some coiner with his tools Made me a counterfeit yet my mother seem'd The Dian of that time So doth my wife The nonpareil of this O vengeance vengeance Me of my lawful pleasure she restrain'd And pray'd me oft forbearance did it with A pudency so rosy the sweet view on't Might well have warm'd old Saturn that I thought her As chaste as unsunn'd snow O all the devils This yellow Iachimo in an hour was't not Or less at first Perchance he spoke not but Like a fullacorn'd boar a German one Cried 'O' and mounted found no opposition But what he look'd for should oppose and she Should from encounter guard Could I find out The woman's part in me For there's no motion That tends to vice in man but I affirm It is the woman's part Be it lying note it The woman's flattering hers deceiving hers Lust and rank thoughts hers hers revenges hers Ambitions covetings change of prides disdain Nice longing slanders mutability All faults that man may name nay that hell knows Why hers in part or all but rather all For even to vice They are not constant but are changing still One vice but of a minute old for one Not half so old as that I'll write against them Detest them curse them Yet 'tis greater skill In a true hate to pray they have their will The very devils cannot plague them better
