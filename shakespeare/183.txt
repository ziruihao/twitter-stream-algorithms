a water look yeYou are rapt sir in some work some dedication To the great lordA thing slipp'd idly from me Our poesy is as a gum which oozes From whence 'tis nourish'd The fire i' th' flint Shows not

his happiness would be well express'd In our conditionNay sir but hear me on All those which were his fellows but of late Some better than his value on the moment Follow his strides his lobbies fill with tendance Rain sacrificial whisperings in his ear Make sacred even his stirrup and through him Drink the free airAy marry what of theseWhen Fortune in her shift and change of mood Spurns down her late beloved all his dependants Which labour'd after him to the mountain's top Even on their knees and hands let him slip down Not one accompanying his declining foot'Tis common A thousand moral

thrust me out of doorsFie th'art a churl ye have got a humour there Does not become a man 'tis much to blame They say my lords Ira furor brevis est but yond man is ever angry Go let him have a table by himself for he does neither affect company nor is he fit for't indeedLet me stay at thine apperil Timon I come to observe I give thee warning on'tI take no heed of thee Th'art an Athenian therefore welcome I myself would have no power prithee let my meat make thee silentI scorn thy meat 't'would choke me for I should ne'er flatter thee O you gods what a number of men eats Timon and he sees 'em not It grieves me to see so many dip their meat in one man's blood and all the madness is he cheers them up too I wonder men dare trust themselves with men Methinks they should invite them without knives Good for their meat and safer for their lives There's much example for't the fellow that sits next him now parts bread with him pledges the breath of him in a divided draught is the readiest man to kill him 'T has been proved If I were a huge man I should fear to drink at meals Lest they should spy my windpipe's dangerous notes Great men should drink with harness on their throatsMy lord in heart and let the health go roundLet it flow this way my good lordFlow this way A brave fellow He keeps his tides well Those healths will make thee and thy state look ill Timon Here's that which is too weak to be a sinner honest water which ne'er left man i' th' mire This and my food are equals there's no odds' Feasts are too proud to give thanks to the gods ' GraceImmortal gods I crave no pelfI pray for no man but myselfGrant I may never prove so fondTo trust man on his oath or bondOr a harlot for her weepingOr a dog that seems asleepingOr a keeper with my freedomOr my friends if I should need 'emAmen So fall to'tRich men sin and I eat root Eats and drinks Much good dich thy good heart ApemantusCaptain Alcibiades your heart's in the field nowMy heart is ever at your service my lordYou had rather be at a breakfast of enemies than dinner of friendsSo they were bleeding new my lord there's no meat like 'em I could wish my best friend at such a feastWould all those flatterers were thine enemies then that then thou mightst kill 'em and bid me to 'emMight we but have that happiness my lord that you would once use our hearts whereby we might express some part of our zeals we should think ourselves for ever perfectO no doubt my good friends but the gods themselves have provided that I shall have much help from you How had you been my friends else Why have you that charitable title from thousands did not you chiefly belong to my heart I have told more of you to myself than you can with modesty speak in your own behalf and thus far I confirm you O you gods think I what need we have any friends if we should ne'er have need of 'em They were the most needless creatures living should we ne'er have use for 'em and would most resemble sweet instruments hung up in cases that keep their sounds to themselves Why I have often wish'd myself poorer that I might come nearer to you We are born to do benefits and what better or properer can we call our own than the riches of our friends O what a precious comfort 'tis to have so many like brothers commanding one another's fortunes O joy's e'en made away ere't can be born Mine eyes cannot hold out water methinks To forget their faults I drink to youThou weep'st to make them drink TimonJoy had the like conception in our eyes And at that instant like a babe sprung upHo ho I laugh to think that babe a bastardI

admittance Music make their welcome You see my lord how ample y'are belov'd Music Rewitb a Masque of as Amazons with lutes in their hands dancing and playingHoyday what a sweep of vanity comes this way They dance They are mad women Like madness is the glory of this life As this pomp shows to a little oil and root We make ourselves fools to disport ourselves And spend our flatteries to drink those men Upon whose age we void it up again With poisonous spite and envy Who lives that's not depraved or depraves Who dies that bears not one spurn to their graves Of their friends' gift I should fear those that dance before me now Would one day stamp upon me 'T has been done Men shut their doors against a setting sunThe rise from table with much adoring ofand to show their loves each single out an Amazon and all dance men witb women a lofty strain or two to the hautboys and ceaseYou have done our pleasures much grace fair ladies Set a fair fashion on our tainment Which was not half so beautiful and kind You have added worth unto't and lustre And tain'd me with mine own device I am to thank you for'tMy lord you take us even at the bestFaith for the worst is filthy and would not hold taking I doubt meLadies there is an idle banquet attends you Please you to dispose yourselvesMost thankfully my lord FlaviusMy lordThe little casket bring me hitherYes my lord Aside More jewels yet

welcomeI beseech your honour vouchsafe me a word it does concern you nearNear Why then another time I'll hear thee I prithee let's be provided to show them tainmentAside I scarce know how another May it please vour honour Lord Lucius out of his free love hath presented to you four milkwhite horses trapp'd in silverI shall accept them fairly Let the presents Be worthily tain'd a thirdHow now What newsPlease you my lord that honourable gentleman Lord Lucullus entreats your company tomorrow to hunt with him and has sent your honour two brace of greyhoundsI'll hunt with him and let them be receiv'd Not without fair reward Aside What will this come to He commands us to provide and give great gifts And all out of an empty coffer Nor will he know his purse or yield me this To show him what a beggar his heart is Being of no power to make his wishes good His promises fly so beyond his state That what he speaks is all in debt he owes For ev'ry word He is so kind that he now Pays interest for't his land's put to their books Well would I were gently put out of office Before I were forc'd out Happier is he that has no friend to feed Than such that do e'en enemies exceed I bleed inwardly for my lord You do yourselves much wrong You bate too much of your own merits Here my lord a trifle of our loveWith more than common thanks I will receive itO he's the very soul of bountyAnd now I remember my lord you gave good words the other day of a bay courser I rode on 'Tis yours because you lik'd itO I beseech you pardon me my lord in thatYou may take my word my lord I know no man Can justly praise but what he does affect I weigh my friend's affection with mine own I'll tell you true I'll call to youO none so welcomeI take all and your several visitations So kind to heart 'tis not enough to give Methinks I could deal kingdoms to my friends And ne'er be weary Alcibiades Thou art a soldier therefore seldom rich It comes in charity to thee for all thy living Is 'mongst the dead and all the lands thou hast Lie in a pitch'd fieldAy defil'd land my lordWe are so virtuously boundAnd so am I to youSo infinitely endear'dAll to you Lights more lightsThe best of happiness honour and fortunes keep with you Lord TimonReady for his friendsall but and What a coil's here Serving of becks and juttingout of bums I doubt whether their legs be worth the sums That are given for 'em Friendship's full of dregs Methinks false hearts should never have sound legs Thus honest fools lay out their wealth on curtsiesNow Apemantus if thou wert not sullen I would be good to theeNo I'll nothing for if I should be brib'd too there would be none left to rail upon thee and then thou wouldst sin the faster Thou giv'st so long Timon I fear me thou wilt give away thyself in paper shortly What needs these feasts pomps and vaingloriesNay an you begin to rail on society once I am sworn not to give regard to you Farewell and come with better musicSo Thou wilt not hear me now thou shalt not then I'll lock thy heaven from thee O that men's ears should be To counsel deaf but not to flattery
