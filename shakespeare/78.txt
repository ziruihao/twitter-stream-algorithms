match is made she seals it with a curtsyBut stay thee 'tis the fruits of love I meanThe fruits of love I mean my loving liegeAy but I fear me in another sense What love thinkst thou I sue so much to

mighty lord this merry inclination Accords not with the sadness of my suit Please you dismiss me either with ay or noAy if thou wilt say ay to my request No if thou dost say no to my demandThen no my lord My suit is at an endThe widow likes him not she knits her browsHe is the bluntest wooer in ChristendomAside Her looks doth argue her replete with modesty Her words doth show her wit incomparable All her perfections challenge sovereignty One way or other she is for a king And she shall be my love or else my queen Say that King Edward take thee for his queen'Tis better said than done my gracious lord I am a subject fit to jest withal But far unfit to be a sovereignSweet widow by my state I swear to thee I speak no more than what my soul intends And that is to enjoy thee for my loveAnd that is more than I will yield unto I know I am too mean to be your queen And yet too good to be your concubineYou cavil widow I did mean my queen'Twill grieve your Grace my sons should call you father No more than when my daughters call thee mother Thou art a widow and thou hast some children And by God's Mother I being but a bachelor Have other some Why 'tis a happy thing To be the father unto many sons Answer no more for thou shalt be my queenThe ghostly father now hath done his shriftWhen he was made a shriver 'twas for shriftBrothers you muse what chat we two have hadThe widow likes it not for she looks very sadYou'd think it strange if I should marry herTo who my lordWhy Clarence to myselfThat would be ten days' wonder at the leastThat's a day longer than a wonder lastsBy so much is the wonder in extremesWell jest on brothers I can tell you both Her suit is granted for her husband's lands a My gracious lord Henry your foe is taken And brought your prisoner to your palace gateSee that he be convey'd unto the Tower And go we brothers to the man that took him To question of his apprehension Widow go you along Lords use her honourably all but Ay Edward will use women honourably Would he were wasted marrow bones and all That from his loins no hopeful branch may spring To cross me from the golden time I look for And yet between my soul's desire and me The lustful Edward's title buried Is Clarence Henry and his son young Edward And all the unlook'd for issue of their bodies To take their rooms ere I can place myself A cold premeditation for my purpose Why then I do but dream on sovereignty Like one that stands upon a promontory And spies a faroff shore where he would tread Wishing his foot were equal with his eye And chides the sea that sunders him from thence Saying he'll lade it dry to have his way So do I wish the crown being so far off And so I chide the means that keeps me from it And so I say I'll cut the causes off Flattering me with impossibilities My eye's too quick my heart o'erweens too much Unless my hand and strength could equal them Well say there is no kingdom then for Richard What other pleasure can the world afford I'll make my heaven in a lady's lap And deck my body in gay ornaments And witch sweet ladies with my words and looks O miserable thought and more unlikely Than to accomplish twenty golden crowns Why love forswore me in my mother's womb And for I should not deal in her soft laws She did corrupt frail nature with some bribe To shrink mine arm up like a wither'd shrub To make an envious mountain on my back Where sits deformity to mock my body To shape my legs of an unequal size To disproportion me in every part Like to a chaos or an unlick'd bearwhelp That carries no impression like the dam And am I then a man to be belov'd O monstrous fault to harbour such a thought Then since this earth affords no joy to me But to command to check to o'erbear such As are of better person than myself I'll make my heaven to dream upon the crown And whiles I live t' account this world but hell Until my misshap'd trunk that bear this head Be round impaled with a glorious crown And yet I know not how to get the crown For many lives stand between me and home And I like one lost in a thorny wood That rents the thorns and is rent with the thorns Seeking a way and straying from the way Not knowing how to find the open air But toiling desperately to find it out Torment myself to catch the English crown And from that torment I will free myself Or hew my way out with a bloody axe Why I can smile and murder whiles I smile And cry 'Content' to that which grieves my heart And wet my cheeks with artificial tears And frame my face to all occasions I'll drown more sailors than the mermaid shall I'll slay more gazers than the basilisk I'll play the orator as well as Nestor Deceive more slily than Ulysses could And like a Sinon take another Troy I can add colours to the chameleon Change shapes with Protheus for advantages And set the murderous Machiavel to school Can I do this and cannot get a crown Tut were it farther off I'll pluck it down FranceThepalace Flourish the French King his sisterhis Admiral call'dand the of sits and riseth up againFair Queen of England worthy Margaret Sit down with us It ill befits thy state And birth that thou shouldst stand while Lewis doth sitNo mighty King of France Now Margaret Must strike her sail and learn a while to serve Where kings command I was I must confess Great Albion's Queen in former golden days But now mischance hath trod my title down And with dishonour laid me on the ground Where I must take like seat unto my fortune And to my humble seat conform myselfWhy say fair Queen whence springs this deep despairFrom such a cause as fills mine eyes with tears And stops my tongue while heart is drown'd in caresWhate'er it be be thou still like thyself And sit thee by our side Seats her by him Yield not thy neck To fortune's yoke but let thy dauntless mind Still ride in triumph over all mischance Be plain Queen Margaret and tell thy grief It shall be eas'd if France can yield reliefThose gracious words revive my drooping thoughts And give my tonguetied sorrows leave to speak Now therefore be it known to noble Lewis That Henry sole possessor of my love Is of a king become a banish'd man And forc'd to live in Scotland a forlorn While proud ambitious Edward Duke of York Usurps the regal title and the seat Of England's trueanointed lawful King This is the cause that I poor Margaret With this my son Prince Edward Henry's heir Am come to crave thy just and lawful aid And if thou fail us all our hope is done Scotland hath will to help but cannot help Our people and our peers are both misled Our treasure seiz'd our soldiers put to flight And as thou seest ourselves in heavy plightRenowned Queen with patience calm the storm While we bethink a means to break it offThe more we stay the stronger grows our foeThe more I stay the more I'll succour theeO but impatience waiteth on true sorrow And see where comes the breeder of my sorrowWhat's he approacheth boldly to our presenceOur Earl of Warwick Edward's greatest friendWelcome brave Warwick What brings thee to France He descends She arisethAy now begins a second storm to rise For this is he that moves both wind and tideFrom worthy Edward King of Albion My lord and sovereign and thy vowed friend I come in kindness and unfeigned love First to do greetings to thy royal person And then to crave a league of amity And lastly to confirm that amity With nuptial knot if thou vouchsafe to grant That virtuous Lady Bona thy fair sister To England's King in lawful marriageAside If that go forward Henry's hope is doneToAnd gracious madam in our king's behalf I am commanded with your leave and favour Humbly to kiss your hand and with my tongue To tell the passion of my sovereign's heart Where fame late ent'ring at his heedful ears Hath plac'd thy beauty's image and thy virtueKing Lewis and Lady Bona hear me speak Before you answer Warwick His demand Springs not from Edward's wellmeant honest love But from deceit bred by necessity For how can tyrants safely govern home Unless abroad they purchase great alliance To prove him tyrant this reason may suffice That Henry liveth still but were he dead Yet here Prince Edward stands King Henry's son Look therefore Lewis that by this league and marriage Thou draw not on thy danger and dishonour For though usurpers sway the rule a while Yet heav'ns are just and time suppresseth wrongsInjurious Margaret And why not QueenBecause thy father Henry did usurp And thou no more art prince than she is queenThen Warwick disannuls great John of Gaunt Which did subdue the greatest part of Spain And after John of Gaunt Henry the Fourth Whose wisdom was a mirror to the wisest And after that wise prince Henry the Fifth Who by his prowess conquered all France From these our Henry lineally descendsOxford how haps it in this smooth discourse You told not how Henry the Sixth hath lost All that which Henry the Fifth had gotten Methinks these peers of France should smile at that But for the rest you tell a pedigree Of threescore and two years a silly time To make prescription for a kingdom's worthWhy Warwick canst thou speak against thy liege Whom thou obeyed'st thirty and six years And not betray thy treason with a blushCan Oxford that did ever fence the right Now buckler falsehood with a pedigree For shame Leave Henry and call Edward kingCall him my king by whose injurious doom My elder brother the Lord Aubrey Vere Was done to death and more than so my father Even in the downfall of his mellow'd years When nature brought him to the door of death No Warwick no while life upholds this arm This arm upholds the house of LancasterAnd I the house of YorkQueen Margaret Prince Edward and Oxford Vouchsafe at our request to stand aside While I use further conference with Warwick They stand aloofHeavens grant that Warwick's words bewitch him notNow Warwick tell me even upon thy conscience Is Edward your true king for I were loath To link with him that were not lawful chosenThereon I pawn my credit and mine honourBut is he gracious in the people's eyeThe more that Henry was unfortunateThen further all dissembling set aside Tell me for truth the measure of his love Unto our sister BonaSuch it seems As may beseem a monarch like himself Myself have often heard him say and swear That this his love was an eternal plant Whereof the root was fix'd in virtue's ground The leaves and fruit maintain'd with beauty's sun Exempt from envy but not from disdain Unless the Lady Bona quit his painNow sister let us hear your firm resolveYour grant or your denial shall be mine ToYet I confess that often ere this day When I have heard your king's desert recounted Mine ear hath tempted judgment to desireThen Warwick thus our sister shall be Edward's And now forthwith shall articles be drawn Touching the jointure that your king must make Which with her dowry shall be counterpois'd Draw near Queen Margaret and be a witness That Bona shall be wife to the English king To Edward but not to the English kingDeceitful Warwick it was thy device By this alliance to make void my suit Before thy coming Lewis was Henry's friendAnd still is friend to him and Margaret But if your title to the crown be weak As may appear by Edward's good success Then 'tis but reason that I be releas'd From giving aid which late I promised Yet shall you have all kindness at my hand That your estate requires and mine can yieldHenry now lives in Scotland at his case Where having nothing nothing can he lose And as for you yourself our quondam queen You have a father able to maintain you And better 'twere you troubled him than FrancePeace impudent and shameless Warwick Proud setter up and puller down of kings I will not hence till with my talk and tears Both full of truth I make King Lewis behold Thy sly conveyance and thy lord's false love For both of you are birds of selfsame feather blowing a horn withinWarwick this is some post to us or thee the My lord ambassador these letters are for you Sent from your brother Marquis Montague These from our King unto your Majesty And madam these for you from whom I know notThey all read their lettersI like it well that our fair Queen and mistress Smiles at her news while Warwick frowns at his Nay mark how Lewis stamps as he were nettled I hope all's for the bestWarwick what are thy news And yours fair QueenMine such as fill my heart with unhop'd joysMine full of sorrow and heart's discontentWhat has your king married the Lady Grey And now to soothe your forgery and his Sends me a paper to persuade me patience Is this th' alliance that he seeks with France Dare he presume to scorn us in this mannerI told your Majesty as much before This proveth Edward's love and Warwick's honestyKing Lewis I here protest in sight of heaven And by the hope I have of heavenly bliss That I am clear from this misdeed of Edward's No more my king for he dishonours me But most himself if he could see his shame Did I forget that by the house of York My father came untimely to his death Did I let pass th' abuse done to my niece Did I impale him with the regal crown Did I put Henry from his native right And am I guerdon'd at the last with shame Shame on himself for my desert is honour And to repair my honour lost for him I here renounce him and return to Henry My noble Queen let former grudges pass And henceforth I am thy true servitor I will revenge his wrong to Lady Bona And replant Henry in his former stateWarwick these words have turn'd my hate to love And I forgive and quite forget old faults And joy that thou becom'st King Henry's friendSo much his friend ay his unfeigned friend That if King Lewis vouchsafe to furnish us With some few bands of chosen soldiers I'll undertake to land them on our coast And force the tyrant from his seat by war 'Tis not his newmade bride shall succour him And as for Clarence as my letters tell me He's very likely now to fall from him For matching more for wanton lust than honour Or than for strength and safety of our countryDear brother how shall Bona be reveng'd But by thy help to this distressed queenRenowned Prince how shall poor Henry live Unless thou rescue him from foul despairMy quarrel and this English queen's are oneAnd mine fair Lady Bona joins with yoursAnd mine with hers and thine and Margaret's Therefore at last I firmly am resolv'd You shall have aidLet me give humble thanks for all at onceThen England's messenger return in post And tell false Edward thy supposed king That Lewis of France is sending over masquers To revel it with him and his new bride Thou seest what's past go fear thy king withalTell him in hope he'll prove a widower shortly I'll wear the willowgarland for his sakeTell him my mourning weeds are laid aside And I am ready to put armour onTell him from me that he hath done me wrong And therefore I'll uncrown him ere't be long There's thy reward be goneBut Warwick Thou and Oxford with five thousand men Shall cross the seas and bid false Edward battle And as occasion serves this noble Queen And Prince shall follow with a fresh supply Yet ere thou go but answer me one doubt What pledge have we of thy firm loyaltyThis shall assure my constant loyalty That if our Queen and this young Prince agree I'll join mine eldest daughter and my joy To him forthwith in holy wedlock bandsYes I agree and thank you for your motion Son Edward she is fair and virtuous Therefore delay not give thy hand to Warwick And with thy hand thy faith irrevocable That only Warwick's daughter shall be thine Yes I accept her for she well deserves it And here to pledge my vow I give my hand He gives his hand to stay we now These soldiers shall be levied And thou Lord Bourbon our High Admiral Shall waft them over with our royal fleet I long till Edward fall by war's mischance For mocking marriage with a dame of Franceall but I came from Edward as ambassador But I return his sworn and mortal foe Matter of marriage was the charge he gave me But dreadful war shall answer his demand Had he none else to make a stale but me Then none but I shall turn his jest to sorrow I was the chief that rais'd him to the crown And I'll be chief to bring him down again Not that I pity Henry's misery But seek revenge on Edward's mockery
