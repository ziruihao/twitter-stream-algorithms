 SceneElsinore A room in the CastleKing and Queen with Rosencrantz and Guildenstern King There's matter in these sighs These profound heaves You must translate 'tis fit we understand them Where is your son Queen Bestow this place on us a little whileRosencrantz and Guildenstern Ah mine own lord what have I seen tonight King What Gertrude How does Hamlet Queen Mad as the sea and wind when both contend Which is the mightier In his lawless fit Behind the arras hearing something stir Whips out his rapier cries 'A rat a rat' And in this brainish apprehension kills The unseen good old man King O heavy deed It had been so with us had we been there His liberty is full of threats to all To you yourself to us to every one Alas how shall this bloody deed be answer'd It will be laid to us whose providence Should have kept short restrain'd and out of haunt This mad young man But so much was our love We would not understand what was most fit But like the owner of a foul disease To keep it from divulging let it feed Even on the pith of life Where is he gone Queen To draw apart the body he hath kill'd O'er whom his very madness like some ore Among a mineral of metals base Shows itself pure He weeps for what is done King O Gertrude come away The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch But we will ship him hence and this vile deed We must with all our majesty and skill Both countenance and excuse Ho Guildenstern Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Friends both go join you with some further aid Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain And from his mother's closet hath he dragg'd him Go seek him out speak fair and bring the body Into the chapel I pray you haste in thisRosencrantz and Guildenstern Come Gertrude we'll call up our wisest friends And let them know both what we mean to do And what's untimely done So haply slander Whose whisper o'er the world's diameter As level as the cannon to his blank Transports his poisoned shot may miss our name And hit the woundless air O come away My soul is full of discord and dismaySceneElsinore A passage in the CastleHamlet Ham Safely stow'd Gentlemen within Hamlet Lord Hamlet Ham But soft What noise Who calls on Hamlet O here they come Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Ros What have you done my lord with the dead body Ham Compounded it with dust whereto 'tis kin Ros Tell us where 'tis that we may take it thence And bear it to the chapel Ham Do not believe it Ros Believe what Ham That I can keep your counsel and not mine own Besides to be demanded of a sponge what replication should be made by the son of a king Ros Take you me for a sponge my lord Ham Ay sir that soaks up the King's countenance his rewards his authorities But such officers do the King best service in the end He keeps them like an ape in the corner of his jaw first mouth'd to be last Swallowed When he needs what you have glean'd it is but squeezing you and sponge you shall be dry again Ros I understand you not my lord Ham I am glad of it A knavish speech sleeps in a foolish ear Ros My lord you must tell us where the body is and go with us to the King Ham The body is with the King but the King is not with the body The King is a thing Guil A thing my lord Ham Of nothing Bring me to him Hide fox and all afterSceneElsinore A room in the CastleKing King I have sent to seek him and to find the body How dangerous is it that this man goes loose Yet must not we put the strong law on him He's lov'd of the distracted multitude Who like not in their judgment but their eyes And where 'tis so th' offender's scourge is weigh'd But never the offence To bear all smooth and even This sudden sending him away must seem Deliberate pause Diseases desperate grown By desperate appliance are reliev'd Or not at allRosencrantz How now O What hath befall'n Ros Where the dead body is bestow'd my lord We cannot get from him King But where is he Ros Without my lord guarded to know your pleasure King Bring him before us Ros Ho Guildenstern Bring in my lordHamlet and Guildenstern with Attendants King Now Hamlet where's Polonius Ham At supper King At supper Where Ham Not where he eats but where he is eaten A certain convocation of politic worms are e'en at him Your worm is your only emperor for diet We fat all creatures else to fat us and we fat ourselves for maggots Your fat king and your lean beggar is but variable service two dishes but to one table That's the end King Alas alas Ham A man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a king and eat of the fish that hath fed of that worm King What dost thou mean by this Ham Nothing but to show you how a king may go a progress through the guts of a beggar King Where is Polonius Ham In heaven Send thither to see If your messenger find him not there seek him i' th' other place yourself But indeed if you find him not within this month you shall nose him as you go up the stair into the lobby King Go seek him there To Attendants Ham He will stay till you comeAttendants King Hamlet this deed for thine especial safety Which we do tender as we dearly grieve For that which thou hast done must send thee hence With fiery quickness Therefore prepare thyself The bark is ready and the wind at help Th' associates tend and everything is bent For England Ham For England King Ay Hamlet Ham Good King So is it if thou knew'st our purposes Ham I see a cherub that sees them But come for England Farewell dear mother King Thy loving father Hamlet Ham My mother Father and mother is man and wife man and wife is one flesh and so my mother Come for EnglandKing Follow him at foot tempt him with speed aboard Delay it not I'll have him hence tonight Away for everything is seal'd and done That else leans on th' affair Pray you make hasteRosencrantz and Guildenstern And England if my love thou hold'st at aught As my great power thereof may give thee sense Since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red After the Danish sword and thy free awe Pays homage to us thou mayst not coldly set Our sovereign process which imports at full By letters congruing to that effect The present death of Hamlet Do it England For like the hectic in my blood he rages And thou must cure me Till I know 'tis done Howe'er my haps my joys were ne'er begun
