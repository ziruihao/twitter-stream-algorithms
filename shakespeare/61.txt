huge and proper life Be here presented Now we bear the King Toward Calais Grant him there There seen Heave him away upon your winged thoughts Athwart the sea Behold the English beach Pales in the flood with men with wives and boys Whose shouts and claps outvoice the deepmouth'd sea Which like a mighty whiffler fore the King Seems to prepare his way So let him land And solemnly see him set on to London So swift a pace hath thought that even now You may imagine him upon Blackheath Where that his lords desire him to have borne His bruised helmet and his bended sword Before him through the city He forbids it Being free from vainness and selfglorious pride Giving full trophy signal and ostent Quite from himself to God But now behold In the quick forge and workinghouse of thought How London doth pour out her citizens The mayor and all his brethren in best sort Like to the senators of th' antique Rome With the plebeians swarming at their heels Go forth and fetch their conqu'ring Caesar in As by a lower but loving likelihood Were now the General of our gracious Empress As in good time he may from Ireland coming Bringing rebellion broached on his sword How many would the peaceful city quit To welcome him Much more and much more cause Did they this Harry Now in London place him As yet the lamentation of the French Invites the King of England's stay at home The Emperor's coming in behalf of France To order peace between them and omit All the occurrences whatever chanc'd Till Harry's backreturn again to France There must we bring him and myself have play'd

Kings of France and England That I have labour'd With all my wits my pains and strong endeavours To bring your most imperial Majesties Unto this bar and royal interview Your mightiness on both parts best can witness Since then my office hath so far prevail'd That face to face and royal eye to eye You have congreeted let it not disgrace me If I demand before this royal view What rub or what impediment there is Why that the naked poor and mangled Peace Dear nurse of arts plenties and joyful births Should not in this best garden of the world Our fertile France put up her lovely visage Alas she hath from France too long been chas'd And all her husbandry doth lie on heaps Corrupting in it own fertility Her vine the merry cheerer of the heart Unpruned dies her hedges evenpleach'd Like prisoners wildly overgrown with hair Put forth disorder'd twigs her fallow leas The darnel hemlock and rank fumitory Doth root upon while that the coulter rusts That should deracinate such savagery The even mead that erst brought sweetly forth The freckled cowslip burnet and green clover Wanting the scythe all uncorrected rank Conceives by idleness and nothing teems But hateful docks rough thistles kecksies burs Losing both beauty and utility And as our vineyards fallows meads and hedges Defective in their natures grow to wildness Even so our houses and ourselves and children Have lost or do not learn for want of time The sciences that should become our country But grow like savages as soldiers will That nothing do but meditate on blood To swearing and stern looks diffus'd attire And everything that seems unnatural Which to reduce into our former favout You are assembled and my speech entreats That I may know the let why gentle Peace Should not expel these inconveniences And bless us with her former qualitiesIf Duke of Burgundy you would the peace Whose want gives growth to th' imperfections Which you have cited you must buy that peace With full accord to all our just demands Whose tenours and particular effects You have enschedul'd briefly in your handsThe King hath heard them to the which as yet There is no answer madeWell then the peace Which you before so urg'd lies in his answerI have but with a cursorary eye O'erglanced the articles pleaseth your Grace To appoint some of your council presently To sit with us once more with better heed To resurvey them we will suddenly Pass our accept and peremptory answerBrother we shall Go uncle Exeter And brother Clarence and you brother Gloucester Warwick and Huntington go with the King And take with you free power to ratify Augment or alter as your wisdoms best Shall see advantageable for our dignity Any thing in or out of our demands And we'll consign thereto Will you fair sister Go with the princes or stay here with usOur gracious brother I will go with them Haply a woman's voice may do some good When articles too nicely urg'd be stood onYet leave our cousin Katherine here with us She is our capital demand compris'd Within the forerank of our articlesShe hath good leave all but the and Fair Katherine and most fair Will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms Such as willat a lady's ear And plead his lovesuit to her gentle heartYour Majesty shall mock me I cannot speak your EnglandO fair Katherine if you will love me soundly with your French heart I will be glad to hear you confess it brokenly with your English tongue Do you like me KatePardonnezmoi I cannot tell vat is like meAn angel is like you Kate and you are like an angelQue ditil que je suis semblable a les angesOui vraiment sauf votre grace ainsi ditilI said so dear Katherine and I must not blush to affirm itO bon Dieu les langues des hommes sont pleines de tromperiesWhat says she fair one that the tongues of men are full of deceitsOui dat de tongues of de mans is be full of deceits dat is de PrincessThe Princess is the better Englishwoman I' faith Kate my wooing is fit for thy understanding I am glad thou canst speak no better English for if thou couldst thou wouldst find me such a plain king that thou wouldst think I had sold my farm to buy my crown I know no ways to mince it in love but directly to say 'I love you' Then if you urge me farther than to say 'Do you in faith' I wear out my suit Give me your answer i' faith do and so clap hands and a bargain How say you ladySauf votre honneur me understand wellMarry if you would put me to verses or to dance for your sake Kate why you undid me for the one I have neither words nor measure and for the other I have no strength in measure yet a reasonable measure in strength If I could win a lady at leapfrog or by vaulting into my saddle with my armour on my back under the correction of bragging be it spoken I should quickly leap into wife Or if I might buffet for my love or bound my horse for her favours I could lay on like a butcher and sit like a jackanapes never off But before God Kate I cannot look greenly nor gasp out my cloquence nor I have no cunning in protestation only downright oaths which I never use till urg'd nor never break for urging If thou canst love a fellow of this temper Kate whose face is not worth sunburning that never looks in his glass for love of anything he sees there let thine eye be thy cook I speak to thee plain soldier If thou canst love me for this take me if not to say to thee that I shall die is true but for thy love by the Lord no yet I love thee too And while thou liv'st dear Kate take a fellow of plain and uncoined constancy for he perforce must do thee right because he hath not the gift to woo in other places for these fellows of infinite tongue that can rhyme themselves into ladies' favours they do always reason themselves out again What a speaker is but a prater a rhyme is but a ballad A good leg will fall a straight back will stoop a black beard will turn white a curl'd pate will grow bald a fair face will wither a full eye will wax hollow But a good heart Kate is the sun and the moon or rather the sun and not the moon for it shines bright and never changes but keeps his course truly If thou would have such a one take me and take me take a soldier take a soldier take a king And what say'st thou then to my love Speak my fair and fairly I pray theeIs it possible dat I sould love de enemy of FranceNo it is not possible you should love the enemy of France Kate but in loving me you should love the friend of France for I love France so well that I will not part with a village of it I will have it all mine And Kate when France is mine and I am yours then yours is France and you are mineI cannot tell vat is datNo Kate I will tell thee in French which I am sure will hang upon my tongue like a newmarried wife about her husband's neck hardly to be shook off Je quand sur le possession de France et quand vous avez le possession de moi let me see what then Saint Denis be my speed donc votre est France et vous etes mienne It is as easy for me Kate to conquer the kingdom as to speak so much more French I shall never move thee in French unless it be to laugh at meSauf votre honneur le Francais que vous parlez il est meilleur que l'Anglais lequel je parleNo faith is't not Kate but thy speaking of my tongue and I thine most truly falsely must needs be granted to be much at one But Kate dost thou understand thus much English Canst thou love meI cannot tellCan any of your neighbours tell Kate I'll ask them Come I know thou lovest me and at night when you come into your closet you'll question this gentlewoman about me and I know Kate you will to her dispraise those parts in me that you love with your heart But good Kate mock me mercifully the rather gentle Princess because I love thee cruelly If ever thou beest mine Kate as I have a saving faith within me tells me thou shalt I get thee with scambling and thou must therefore needs prove a good soldierbreeder Shall not thou and I between Saint Denis and Saint George compound a boy half French half English that shall go to Constantinople and take the Turk by the beard Shall we not What say'st thou my fair flowerdeluceI do not know datNo 'tis hereafter to know but now to promise do but now promise Kate you will endeavour for your French part of such a boy and for my English moiety take the word of a king and a bachelor How answer you la plus belle Katherine du monde montres cher et divin deesseYour Majestee ave fausse French enough to deceive de most sage damoiselle dat is en FranceNow fie upon my false French By mine honour in true English I love thee Kate by which honour I dare not swear thou lovest me yet my blood begins to flatter me that thou dost notwithstanding the poor and untempering effect of my visage Now beshrew my father's ambition He was thinking of civil wars when he got me therefore was I created with a stubborn outside with an aspect of iron that when I come to woo ladies I fright them But in faith Kate the elder I wax the better I shall appear my comfort is that old age that in layerup of beauty can do no more spoil upon my face thou hast me if thou hast me at the worst and thou shalt wear me if thou wear me better and better And therefore tell me most fair Katherine will you have me Put off your maiden blushes avouch the thoughts of your heart with the looks of an empress take me by the hand and say 'Harry of England I am thine' Which word thou shalt no sooner bless mine ear withal but I will tell thee aloud 'England is thine Ireland is thine France is thine and Henry Plantagenet is thine' who though I speak it before his face if he be not fellow with the best king thou shalt find the best king of good fellows Come your answer in broken music for thy voice is music and thy English broken therefore Queen of all Katherine break thy mind to me in broken English wilt thou have meDat is as it shall please de roi mon pereNay it will please him well Kate it shall please him KateDen it sall also content meUpon that I kiss your hand and I can you my queenLaissez mon seigneur laissez laissez Ma foi je ne veux point que vous abaissiez votre grandeur en baisant la main d'une notre seigneur indigne serviteur excusezmoi je vous supplie mon tres puissant seigneurThen I will kiss your lips KateLes dames et demoiselles pour etre baisees devant leur noces il n'est pas la coutume de FranceMadame my interpreter what says sheDat it is not be de fashion pour le ladies of France I cannot tell vat is baiser en AnglishTo kissYour Majestee entendre bettre que moiIt is not a fashion for the maids in France to kiss before they are married would she sayOui vraimentO Kate nice customs curtsy to great kings Dear Kate you and I cannot be confin'd within the weak list of a country's fashion we are the makers of manners Kate and the liberty that follows our places stops the mouth of all findfaults as I will do yours for upholding the nice fashion of your country in denying me a kiss therefore patiently and yieldingKissing herYou have witchcraft in your lips Kate there is more eloquence in a sugar touch of them than in the tongues of the French council and they should sooner persuade Henry of England than a general petition of monarchs Here comes your father the and the God save your Majesty My royal cousin Teach you our princess EnglishI would have her learn my fair cousin how perfectly I love her and that is good EnglishIs she not aptOur tongue is rough coz and my condition is not smooth so that having neither the voice nor the heart of flattery about me I cannot so conjure up the spirit of love in her that he will appear in his true likenessPardon the frankness of my mirth if I answer you for that If you would conjure in her you must make a circle if conjure up love in her in his true likeness he must appear naked and blind Can you blame her then being a maid yet ros'd over with the virgin crimson of modesty if she deny the appearance of a naked blind boy in her naked seeing self It were my lord a hard condition for a maid to consign toYet they do wink and yield as love is blind and enforcesThey are then excus'd my lord when they see not what they doThen good my lord teach your cousin to consent winkingI will wink on her to consent my lord if you will teach her to know my meaning for maids well summer'd and warm kept are like flies at Bartholomewtide blind though they have their eyes and then they will endure handling which before would not abide looking onThis moral ties me over to time and a hot summer and so I shall catch the fly your cousin in the latter end and she must be blind tooAs love is my lord before it lovesIt is so and you may some of you thank love for my blindness who cannot see many a fair French city for one fair French maid that stands in my wayYes my lord you see them perspectively the cities turned into a maid for they are all girdled with maiden walls that war hath never ent'redShall Kate be my wifeSo please youI am content so the maiden cities you

noster Henricus Rex Angliae et Haeres FranciaeNor this I have not brother so denied But our request shall make me let it passI pray you then in love and dear alliance Let that one article rank with the rest And thereupon give me your daughterTake her fair son and from her blood raise up Issue to me that the contending kingdoms Of France and England whose very shores look pale With envy of each other's happiness May cease their hatred and this dear conjunction Plant neighbourhood and Christianlike accord In their sweet bosoms that never war advance His bleeding sword 'twixt England and fair FranceAmenNow welcome Kate and bear me witness all That here I kiss her as my sovereign queen FloulishGod the best maker of all marriages Combine your hearts in one your realms in one As man and wife being two are one in love So be there 'twixt your kingdoms such a spousal That never may ill office or fell jealousy Which troubles oft the bed of blessed marriage Thrust in between the paction of these kingdoms To make divorce of their incorporate league That English may as French French Englishmen Receive each other God speak this AmenAmenPrepare we for our marriage on which day My Lord of Burgundy we'll take your oath And all the peers' for surety of our leagues Then shall I swear to Kate and you to me And may our oaths well kept and prosp'rous be Sennet Thus far with rough and
