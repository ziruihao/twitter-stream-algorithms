harshness I must remove Some thousands of these logs and pile them up Upon a sore injunction my sweet mistress Weeps when she sees me work and says such baseness Had never like executor I forget But these sweet thoughts do even refresh my labours Most busy least when I do it and at a distance unseenAlas now pray you Work not so hard I would the lightning had Burnt up those logs that you are
