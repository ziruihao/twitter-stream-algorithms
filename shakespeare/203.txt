legitimate sir upon the oaths of judgment and reasonAnd they have been grandjurymen since before Noah was a sailorShe did show favour to the youth in your sight only to exasperate you to awake your dormouse valour to put fire in your heart and brimstone in your liver You should then have accosted her and with some excellent jests firenew from the mint you should have bang'd the youth into dumbness This was look'd for at your hand and this was baulk'd The double gilt of this opportunity you let time wash off and you are now sail'd into the north of my lady's opinion where you will hang like an icicle on Dutchman's beard unless you do redeem it by some laudable attempt either of valour or policyAn't be any way it must be with valour for policy I hate I had as lief be a Brownist as a politicianWhy then build me thy fortunes upon the basis of valour Challenge me the Count's youth to fight with him hurt him in eleven places My niece shall take note of it and assure thyself there is no lovebroker in the world can more prevail in man's commendation with woman than report of valourThere is no way but this Sir AndrewWill either of you bear me a challenge to himGo write it in a martial hand be curst and brief it is no matter how witty so it be eloquent and full of invention Taunt him with the license of ink if thou thou'st him some thrice it shall not be amiss and as many lies as will lie in thy sheet of paper although the sheet were big enough for the bed of Ware in England set 'em down go about it Let there be gall enough in thy ink though thou write with a goosepen no matter About itWhere shall I find youWe'll call thee at the cubiculo Go This is a dear manakin to you Sir TobyI have been dear to him lad some two thousand strong or soWe shall have a rare letter from him but you'll not deliver'tNever trust me then and by all means stir on the youth to an answer I think oxen and wainropes cannot hale them together For Andrew if he were open'd and you find so much blood in his liver as will clog the foot of a flea I'll eat the rest of th' anatomyAnd his opposite the youth bears in his visage no great presage of cruelty Look where the youngest wren of nine comesIf you desire the spleen and will laugh yourselves into stitches follow me Yond gull Malvolio is turned heathen a very renegado for there is no Christian that means to be saved by believing rightly can ever believe such impossible passages of grossness He's in yellow stockingsAnd crossgarter'dMost villainously like a pedant that keeps a school i' th' church I have dogg'd him like his murderer He does obey every point of the letter that I dropp'd to betray him He does smile his face into more lines than is in the new map with the augmentation of the Indies You have not seen such a thing as 'tis Ican hardly forbear hurling things at him I know my lady will strike him if she do he'll smile and take't for a great favourCome bring us bring us where he is A streetand I would not by my will have troubled you But since you make your pleasure of your pains I will no further chide youI could not stay behind you my desire More sharp than filed steel did spur me forth And not all love to see you though so much As might have drawn one to a longer voyage But jealousy what might befall your travel Being skilless in these parts which to a stranger Unguided and unfriended often prove Rough and unhospitable My willing love The rather by these arguments of fear Set forth in your pursuitMy kind Antonio I can no other answer make but thanks And thanks and ever thanks and oft good turns Are shuffl'd off with such uncurrent pay But were my worth as is my conscience firm You should find better dealing What's to do Shall we go see the reliques of this townTomorrow sir best first go see your lodgingI am not weary and 'tis long to night I pray you let us satisfy our eyes With the memorials and the things of fame That do renown this cityWould you'd pardon me I do not without danger walk these streets Once in a seafight 'gainst the Count his galleys I did some service of such note indeed That were I ta'en here it would scarce be answer'dBelike you slew great number of his people Th' offence is not of such a bloody nature Albeit the quality of the time and quarrel Might well have given us bloody argument It might have since been answer'd in repaying What we took from them which for traffic's sake Most of our city did Only myself stood out For which if I be lapsed in this place I shall pay dearDo not then walk too openIt doth not fit me Hold sir here's my purse In the south suburbs at the Elephant Is best to lodge I will bespeak our diet Whiles you beguile the time and feed your knowledge With viewing of the town there shall you have meWhy I your purseHaply your eye shall light upon some toy You have desire to purchase and your store I think is not for idle markets sirI'll be your pursebearer and leave you for An hourTo th' ElephantI do remembergardenand I have sent after him he says he'll come How shall I feast him What bestow of him For youth is bought more oft than begg'd or borrow'd I speak too loud Where's Malvolio He is sad and civil And suits well for a servant with my fortunes Where is MalvolioHe's coming madam but in very strange manner He is sure possess'd madamWhy what's the matter Does he raveNo madam he does nothing but smile Your ladyship were best to have some guard about you if he come for sure the man is tainted in's witsGo call him hither I am as mad as he If sad and merry madness equal beRe withHow now MalvolioSweet lady

Count Orsino's is return'd I could hardly entreat him back he attends your ladyship's pleasureI'll come to him Good Maria let this fellow be look'd to Where's my cousin Toby Let some of my people have a special care of him I would not have him miscarry for the half of my dowry O ho do you come near me now No worse man than Sir Toby to look to me This concurs directly with the letter she sends him on purpose that I may appear stubborn to him for she incites me to that in the letter 'Cast thy humble slough' says she 'Be opposite with kinsman surly with servants let thy tongue tang with arguments of state put thyself into the trick of singularity' and consequently sets down the manner how as a sad face a reverend carriage a slow tongue in the habit of some sir of note and so forth I have lim'd her but it is Jove's doing and Jove make me thankful And when she went away now 'Let this fellow be look'd to' 'Fellow' not 'Malvolio' nor after my degree but 'fellow' Why everything adheres together that no dram of a scruple no scruple of a scruple no obstacle no incredulous or unsafe circumstance What can be said Nothing that can be can come between me and the full prospect of my hopes Well Jove

bumbaily so soon as ever thou seest him draw and as thou draw'st swear horrible for it comes to pass oft that a terrible oath with a swaggering accent sharply twang'd off gives manhood more approbation than ever proof itself would have earn'd him AwayNay let me alone for swearingNow will not I deliver his letter for the behaviour of the young gentleman gives him out to be of good capacity and breeding his employment between his lord and my niece confirms no less Therefore this letter being so excellently ignorant will breed no terror in the youth he will find it comes from a clodpole But sir I will deliver his challenge by word of mouth set upon Aguecheek notable report of valour and drive the gentleman as know his youth will aptly receive it into a most hideous opinion of his rage skill fury and impetuosity This will so fright them both that they will kill one another by the look like cockatrices ReWith Here he comes with your niece give them way till he take leave and presently after himI will meditate the while upon some horrid message for a challengeand I have said too much unto a heart of stone And laid mine honour too unchary out There's something in me

any image of offence done to any manYou'll find it otherwise I assure you therefore if you hold your life at any price betake you to your guard for your opposite hath in him what youth strength skill and wrath can furnish man withalI pray you sir what is heHe is knight dubb'd with unhatch'd rapier and on carpet consideration but he is a devil in private brawl Souls and bodies hath he divorc'd
