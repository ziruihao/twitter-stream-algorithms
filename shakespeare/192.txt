inmost centre of the earth Then when you come to Pluto's region I pray you deliver him this petition Tell him it is for justice and for aid And that it comes from old Andronicus Shaken with sorrows in ungrateful Rome Ah Rome Well well I made thee miserable What time I threw the people's suffrages On him that thus doth tyrannize o'er me Go get you gone and pray be careful all And leave you not a

others The brings the arrows in his hand thatshot at himWhy lords what wrongs are these Was ever seen An emperor in Rome thus overborne Troubled confronted thus and for the extent Of egal justice us'd in such contempt My lords you know as know the mightful gods However these disturbers of our peace Buzz in the people's ears there nought hath pass'd But even with law against the wilful sons Of old Andronicus And what an if His sorrows have so overwhelm'd his wits Shall we be thus afflicted in his wreaks His fits his frenzy and his bitterness And now he writes to heaven for his redress See here's 'To Jove' and this 'To Mercury' This 'To Apollo' this 'To the God of War' Sweet scrolls to fly about the streets of Rome What's this but libelling against the Senate And blazoning our unjustice every where A goodly humour is it not my lords As who would say in Rome no justice were But if I live his feigned ecstasies Shall be no shelter to these outrages But he and his shall know that justice lives In Saturninus' health whom if she sleep He'll so awake as he in fury shall Cut off the proud'st conspirator that livesMy gracious lord my lovely Saturnine Lord of my life commander of my thoughts Calm thee and bear the faults of Titus' age Th' effects of sorrow for his valiant sons Whose loss hath pierc'd him deep and scarr'd his heart And rather comfort his distressed plight Than prosecute the meanest or the best For these contemptsAsideWhy thus it shall become Highwitted Tamora to gloze with all But Titus I have touch'd thee to the quick Thy lifeblood out if Aaron now be wise Then is all safe the anchor in the portHow now good fellow Wouldst thou speak with usYes forsooth an your mistriship be EmperialEmpress I am but yonder sits the Emperor'Tis he God and Saint Stephen

then I have brought up a neck to a fair end guardedDespiteful and intolerable wrongs Shall I endure this monstrous villainy I know from whence this same device proceeds May this be borne as if his traitorous sons That died by law for murder of our brother Have by my means been butchered wrongfully Go drag the villain hither by the hair Nor age nor honour shall shape privilege For this proud mock I'll be thy slaughterman Sly frantic wretch that holp'st to make me great In hope thyself should govern Rome and meWhat news with thee AemiliusArm my lords Rome never had more cause The Goths have gathered head and with a power Of high resolved men bent to the spoil They hither march amain under conduct Of Lucius son to old Andronicus Who threats in course of this revenge to do As much as ever Coriolanus didIs warlike Lucius general of the Goths These tidings nip me and I hang the head As flowers with frost or grass beat down with storms Ay now begins our sorrows to approach 'Tis he the common people love so much Myself hath often heard them say When I have walked like a private man That Lucius' banishment was wrongfully And they have wish'd that Lucius were their emperorWhy should you fear Is not your city strongAy but the citizens favour Lucius And will revolt from me to succour himKing be thy thoughts imperious like thy name Is the sun dimm'd that gnats do fly in it The eagle suffers little birds to sing And is not careful what they mean thereby Knowing that with the shadow of his wings He can at pleasure stint their melody Even so mayest thou the giddy men of Rome Then cheer thy spirit for know thou Emperor I will enchant the old Andronicus With words more sweet and yet more dangerous Than baits to fish or honeystalks to sheep When as the one is wounded with the bait The other rotted with delicious feedBut he will not entreat his son for usIf Tamora entreat him then he will For I can smooth and fill his aged ears With golden promises that were his heart Almost impregnable his old ears deaf Yet should both ear and heart obey my tongue To Go thou before to be our ambassador Say that the Emperor requests a parley Of warlike Lucius and appoint the meeting Even at his father's house the old AndronicusAemilius do this message honourably And if he stand on hostage for his safety Bid him demand what pledge will please him bestYour bidding shall I do effectuallyNow will I to that old Andronicus And temper him with all the art I have To pluck proud Lucius from the warlike Goths And now sweet Emperor be blithe again And bury all thy fear in my devicesThen go successantly and plead to him
