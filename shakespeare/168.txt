 SceneFriar Laurence's cellFriar Laurence and County Paris Friar On Thursday sir The time is very short Par My father Capulet will have it so And I am nothing slow to slack his haste Friar You say you do not know the lady's mind Uneven is the course I like it not Par Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death And therefore have I little talk'd of love For Venus smiles not in a house of tears Now sir her father counts it dangerous That she do give her sorrow so much sway And in his wisdom hastes our marriage To stop the inundation of her tears Which too much minded by herself alone May be put from her by society Now do you know the reason of this haste Friar aside I would I knew not why it should be slow'd Look sir here comes the lady toward my cellJuliet Par Happily met my lady and my wife Jul That may be sir when I may be a wife Par That may be must be love on Thursday next Jul What must be shall be Friar That's a certain text Par Come you to make confession to this father Jul To answer that I should confess to you Par Do not deny to him that you love me Jul I will confess to you that I love him Par So will ye I am sure that you love me Jul If I do so it will be of more price Being spoke behind your back than to your face Par Poor soul thy face is much abus'd with tears Jul The tears have got small victory by that For it was bad enough before their spite Par Thou wrong'st it more than tears with that report Jul That is no slander sir which is a truth And what I spake I spake it to my face Par Thy face is mine and thou hast sland'red it Jul It may be so for it is not mine own Are you at leisure holy father now Or shall I come to you at evening mass Friar My leisure serves me pensive daughter now My lord we must entreat the time alone Par God shield I should disturb devotion Juliet on Thursday early will I rouse ye Till then adieu and keep this holy kissJul O shut the door and when thou hast done so Come weep with me past hope past cure past help Friar Ah Juliet I already know thy grief It strains me past the compass of my wits I hear thou must and nothing may prorogue it On Thursday next be married to this County Jul Tell me not friar that thou hear'st of this Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help Do thou but call my resolution wise And with this knife I'll help it presently God join'd my heart and Romeo's thou our hands And ere this hand by thee to Romeo's seal'd Shall be the label to another deed Or my true heart with treacherous revolt Turn to another this shall slay them both Therefore out of thy longexperienc'd time Give me some present counsel or behold 'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife Shall play the empire arbitrating that Which the commission of thy years and art Could to no issue of true honour bring Be not so long to speak I long to die If what thou speak'st speak not of remedy Friar Hold daughter I do spy a kind of hope Which craves as desperate an execution As that is desperate which we would prevent If rather than to marry County Paris Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself Then is it likely thou wilt undertake A thing like death to chide away this shame That cop'st with death himself to scape from it And if thou dar'st I'll give thee remedy Jul O bid me leap rather than marry Paris From off the battlements of yonder tower Or walk in thievish ways or bid me lurk Where serpents are chain me with roaring bears Or shut me nightly in a charnel house O'ercover'd quite with dead men's rattling bones With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls Or bid me go into a newmade grave And hide me with a dead man in his shroud Things that to hear them told have made me tremble And I will do it without fear or doubt To live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love Friar Hold then Go home be merry give consent To marry Paris Wednesday is tomorrow Tomorrow night look that thou lie alone Let not the nurse lie with thee in thy chamber Take thou this vial being then in bed And this distilled liquor drink thou off When presently through all thy veins shall run A cold and drowsy humour for no pulse Shall keep his native progress but surcease No warmth no breath shall testify thou livest The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade To paly ashes thy eyes' windows fall Like death when he shuts up the day of life Each part depriv'd of supple government Shall stiff and stark and cold appear like death And in this borrowed likeness of shrunk death Thou shalt continue twoandforty hours And then awake as from a pleasant sleep Now when the bridegroom in the morning comes To rouse thee from thy bed there art thou dead Then as the manner of our country is In thy best robes uncovered on the bier Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie In the mean time against thou shalt awake Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift And hither shall he come and he and I Will watch thy waking and that very night Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua And this shall free thee from this present shame If no inconstant toy nor womanish fear Abate thy valour in the acting it Jul Give me give me O tell not me of fear Friar Hold Get you gone be strong and prosperous In this resolve I'll send a friar with speed To Mantua with my letters to thy lord Jul Love give me strength and strength shall help afford Farewell dear fatherSceneCapulet's houseFather Capulet Mother Nurse and Servingmen two or three Cap So many guests invite as here are writa Servingman Sirrah go hire me twenty cunning cooks Serv You shall have

selfwill'd harlotry it isJuliet Nurse See where she comes from shrift with merry look Cap How now my headstrong Where have you been gadding Jul Where I have learnt me to repent the sin Of disobedient opposition To you and your behests and am enjoin'd By holy Laurence to fall prostrate here To beg your pardon Pardon I beseech you Henceforward I am ever rul'd by you Cap Send for the County Go tell him of this I'll have this knot knit up tomorrow morning Jul I met the youthful lord at Laurence' cell And gave him what becomed love I might Not stepping o'er the bounds of modesty Cap Why I am glad on't This is well Stand up This is as't should be Let me see the County Ay marry go I say and fetch him hither Now afore God this reverend holy friar All our whole city is much bound to him Jul Nurse will you go with me into my closet To help me sort such needful ornaments As you think fit to furnish me tomorrow Mother No not till Thursday There is time enough Cap Go nurse go with her We'll to

business Mother Good night Get thee to bed and rest for thou hast needMother and Nurse Jul Farewell God knows when we shall meet again I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins That almost freezes up the heat of life I'll call them back again to comfort me Nurse What should she do here My dismal scene I needs must act alone Come vial What if this mixture do not work at all Shall I be married then tomorrow morning No No This shall forbid it Lie thou thereLays down a dagger What if it be a poison which the friar Subtilly hath minist'red to have me dead Lest in this marriage he should be dishonour'd Because he married me before to Romeo I fear it is and yet methinks it should not For he hath still been tried a holy man I will not tain so bad a thought How if when I am laid into the tomb I wake before the time that Romeo Come to redeem me There's a fearful point Shall I not then be stifled in the vault To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes Or if I live is it not very like The horrible conceit of death and night Together with the terror of the place As in a vault an ancient receptacle Where for this many hundred years the bones Of all my buried ancestors are pack'd Where bloody Tybalt yet but green in earth Lies fest'ring in his shroud where as they say At some hours in the night spirits resort Alack alack is it not like that I So early waking what with loathsome smells And shrieks like mandrakes torn out of the earth That living mortals hearing them run mad O if I wake shall I not be distraught Environed with all these hideous fears And madly play with my forefathers' joints And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud And in this rage with some great kinsman's bone As with a club dash out my desp'rate brains O look methinks I see my cousin's ghost Seeking out Romeo that did spit his body Upon a rapier's point Stay Tybalt stay Romeo I come this do I drink to thee She drinks and falls upon her bed within the curtainsSceneCapulet's houseLady of the House and Nurse Lady Hold take these keys and fetch more spices nurse Nurse They call for dates and quinces in the pastry Old Capulet

thy wife See there she lies Flower as she was deflowered by him Death is my soninlaw Death is my heir My daughter he hath wedded I will die And leave him all Life living all is Death's Par Have I thought long to see this morning's face And doth it give me such a sight as this Mother Accurs'd unhappy wretched hateful day Most miserable hour that e'er time saw In lasting labour of his pilgrimage But one poor one one poor and loving child But one thing to rejoice and solace in And cruel Death hath catch'd it from my sight Nurse O woe O woful woful woful day Most lamentable day most woful day

confusions Heaven and yourself Had part in this fair maid now heaven hath all And all the better is it for the maid Your part in her you could not keep from death But heaven keeps his part in eternal life The most you sought was her promotion For 'twas your heaven she should be advanc'd And weep ye now seeing she is advanc'd Above the clouds as high as heaven itself O in this love you love your child so ill That you run mad seeing that she is well She's not well married that lives married long But she's best married that dies married young Dry up your tears and stick your rosemary On this fair corse and as the custom is In all her best array bear her to church For though fond nature bids us all lament Yet nature's tears are reason's merriment Cap All things that we ordained festival Turn from their office to black funeral Our instruments to melancholy bells Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse And all things change them to the contrary Friar Sir go you in and madam go with him And go Sir Paris Every one prepare To follow this fair corse unto her grave The heavens do low'r upon you for some
