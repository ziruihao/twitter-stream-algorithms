 A city in Illyria and the seacoast near itThepalace Duke of Illyriaand otherattendingIf music be the food of love play on Give me excess of it that surfeiting The appetite may sicken and so die That strain again It had a dying fall O it came o'er my ear like the sweet sound That breathes upon a bank of violets Stealing and giving odour Enough no more 'Tis not so sweet now as it was before O

purg'd the air of pestilence That instant was I turn'd into a hart And my desires like fell and cruel hounds E'er since pursue meHow now what news from herSo please my lord I might not be admitted But from her handmaid do return this answer The element itself till seven years' heat Shall not behold her face at ample view But like a cloistress she will veiled walk And water once a day her chamber round With eyeoffending brine all this to season A brother's dead love which she would keep fresh And lasting in her sad remembranceO she that hath a heart of that fine frame To pay this debt of love but to a brother How will she love when the rich golden shaft Hath kill'd the flock of all affections else That live in her when liver brain and heart These sovereign thrones are all supplied and fill'd Her sweet perfections with one self king Away before me to sweet beds of flow'rs Lovethoughts lie rich when canopied with bow'rs The seacoast aand What country friends is thisThis is Illyria

beTrue madam and to comfort you with chance Assure yourself after our ship did split When you and those poor number saved with you Hung on our driving boat I saw your brother Most provident in peril

you are the cruell'st she alive If you will lead these graces to the grave And leave the world no copyO sir I will not be so hardhearted I will give out divers schedules of my beauty It shall be inventoried and every particle and utensil labell'd to my will as item two lips indifferent red item two grey eyes with lids to them item one neck one chin and so forth Were you sent hither to praise meI see you what you are you are too proud But if you were the devil you are fair My lord and master loves you O such love Could be but recompens'd though you were crown'd The nonpareil of beautyHow does he love meWith adorations fertile tears With groans that thunder love with sighs of fireYour lord does know my mind I cannot love him Yet I suppose him virtuous know him noble Of great estate of fresh and stainless youth In voices well divulg'd free learn'd and valiant And in dimension and the shape of nature A gracious person but yet I cannot love him He might have took his answer long agoIf I did love you in my master's flame With such a suff'ring such a deadly life In your denial I would find no sense I would not understand itWhy what would youMake me a willow cabin at your gate And call upon my soul within the house Write loyal cantons of contemned love And sing them loud even in the dead of night Halloo your name to the reverberate hals And make the babbling gossip of the air Cry out 'Olivia' O you should not rest Between the elements of air and earth But you should pity meYou might do much What is your parentageAbove my fortunes yet my state is well I am a gentlemanGet

your parentage' 'Above my fortunes yet my state is well I am a gentleman' I'll be sworn thou art Thy tongue thy face thy limbs actions and spirit Do give thee fivefold blazon Not too fast Soft soft Unless the master were the man How now Even so quickly may one catch the plague Methinks I feel this youth's perfections With an invisible and subtle stealth To creep in at mine eyes Well let it be What ho Malvolio Re Here madam at your serviceRun after that same peevish messenger The County's man He left this ring behind him Would I or not Tell him I'll none of it Desire him not to flatter with
