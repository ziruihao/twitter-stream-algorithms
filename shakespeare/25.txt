Rome A public place with the two Tribunes of the people and The augurer tells me we shall have news tonightGood or badNot according to the prayer of the people for they love not MarciusNature teaches beasts to know their friendsPray you who does the wolf loveThe lambAy to devour him as the hungry plebeians would the noble MarciusHe's a lamb indeed that baes like a bearHe's a bear indeed that lives fike a lamb You two are old men tell me one thing that I shall ask youWell sirIn what enormity is Marcius poor in that you two have not in abundanceHe's poor in no one fault but stor'd with allEspecially in prideAnd topping all others in boastingThis is strange now Do you two know how you are censured here in the city I mean of us o' th' righthand file Do youWhy how are we censur'dBecause you talk of pride now will you not be angryWell well sir wellWhy 'tis no great matter for a very little thief of occasion will rob you of a great deal of patience Give your dispositions the reins and be angry at your pleasures at the least if you take it as a pleasure to you in being so You blame Marcius for being proudWe do it not alone sirI know you can do very little alone for your helps are many or else your actions would grow wondrous single your abilities are too infantlike for doing much alone You talk of pride O that you could turn your eyes toward the napes of your necks and make but an interior survey of your good selves O that you couldWhat then sirWhy then you should discover a brace of unmeriting proud violent testy magistratesalias fools as any in RomeMenenius you are known well enough tooI am known to be a humorous patrician and one that loves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying Tiber in't said to be something imperfect in favouring the first complaint hasty and tinderlike upon too trivial motion one that converses more with the buttock of the night than with the forehead of the morning What I think I utter and spend my malice in my breath Meeting two such wealsmen as you are I cannot call you Lycurguses if the drink you give me touch my palate adversely I make a crooked face at it I cannot say your worships have deliver'd the matter well when I find the ass in compound with the major part of your syllables and though I must be content to bear with those that say you are reverend grave men yet they lie deadly that tell you you have good faces If you see this in the map of my microcosm follows it that I am known well enough too What harm can your bisson conspectuities glean out of this character if I be known well enough tooCome sir come we know you well enoughYou know neither me yourselves nor any thing You are ambitious for poor knaves' caps and legs you wear out a good wholesome forenoon in hearing a cause between an orangewife and a fossetseller and then rejourn the controversy of threepence to a second day of audience When you are hearing a matter between party and party if you chance to be pinch'd with the colic you make faces like mummers set up the bloody flag against all patience and in roaring for a chamberpot dismiss the controversy bleeding the more entangled by your hearing All the peace you make in their cause is calling both the parties knaves You are a pair of strange onesCome come you are well understood to be a perfecter giber for the table than a necessary bencher in the CapitolOur very priests must become mockers if they shall encounter such ridiculous subjects as you are When you speak best unto the purpose it is not worth the wagging of your beards and your beards deserve not so honourable a grave as to stuff a botcher's cushion or to be entomb'd in an ass's packsaddle Yet you must be saying Marcius is proud who in a cheap estimation is worth all your predecessors since Deucalion though peradventure some of the best of 'em were hereditary hangmen Godden to your worships More of your conversation would infect my brain being the herdsmen of the beastly plebeians I will be bold to take my leave of you and go aside andHow now my as fair as noble ladies and the moon were she earthly no nobler whither do you follow your eyes so fastHonourable Menenius my boy Marcius

ladies let's go Yes yes yes the Senate has letters from the general wherein he gives my son the whole name of the war he hath in this action outdone his former deeds doublyIn troth there's wondrous

worships Marcius is coming home he has more cause to be proud Where is he woundedI' th' shoulder and i' th' left arm there will be large cicatrices to show the people when he shall stand for his place He received in the repulse of Tarquin seven hurts i' th' bodyOne i' th' neck and two i' th' thigh there's nine that I knowHe had before this last expedition twentyfive wounds upon himNow it's

follyEver rightMenenius ever everGive way there and go on To his wife and motherYour hand and yours Ere in our own house I do shade my head The good patricians must be visited From whom I have receiv'd not only greetings But with them change of honoursI have lived To see inherited my very wishes And the buildings of my fancy only There's one thing wanting which I doubt not but Our Rome will cast upon theeKnow good mother I had rather be their servant in my way Than sway with them in theirsOn to the CapitolFlourish Cornetsin state as before and come forwardAll tongues speak of him and the bleared sights Are spectacled to see him Your prattling nurse Into a rapture lets her baby cry While she chats him the kitchen malkin pins Her richest lockram 'bout her reechy neck Clamb'ring the walls to eye him stalls bulks windows Are smother'd up leads fill'd and ridges hors'd With variable complexions all agreeing In earnestness to see him Seldshown flamens Do press among the popular throngs and puff To win a vulgar station our veil'd dames Commit the war of white and damask in Their nicely gawded cheeks to th' wanton spoil Of Phoebus' burning kisses Such a pother As if that whatsoever god who leads him Were slily crept into his human powers And gave him graceful postureOn the sudden I warrant him consulThen our office may During his power go sleepHe cannot temp'rately transport his honours From where he should begin and end but will Lose those he hath wonIn that there's comfortDoubt not The commoners for whom we stand but they Upon their ancient malice will forget With the least cause these his new honours which That he will give them make I as little question As he is proud to do'tI heard him swear Were he to stand for consul never would he Appear i' th' marketplace nor on him put The napless vesture of humility Nor showing as the manner is his wounds To th' people beg their stinking breaths'Tis rightIt was his word O he would miss it rather Than carry it but by the suit of the gentry to him And the desire of the noblesI wish no better Than have him hold that purpose and to put it In execution'Tis most like he willIt shall be to him then as our good wills A sure destructionSo it must fall out To him or our authorities For an end We must suggest the people in what hatred He still hath held them that to's power he would Have made them mules silenc'd their pleaders and Dispropertied their freedoms holding them In human action and capacity Of no more soul nor fitness for the world Than camels in their war who have their provand Only for bearing burdens and sore blows For sinking under themThis as you say suggested At some time when his soaring insolence Shall touch the people which time shall not want If he be put upon't and that's as easy As to set dogs on sheep will be his fire To kindle their dry stubble and their blaze Shall darken him for ever A What's the matterYou are sent for to the Capitol 'Tis thought That Marcius shall be consul I have seen the dumb men throng to see him and The blind to hear him speak matrons flung gloves Ladies and maids their scarfs and handkerchers Upon him as he pass'd the nobles bended As to Jove's statue and the commons made A shower and thunder with their caps and shouts I never saw the likeLet's to the Capitol And carry with us ears and eyes for th' time But hearts for the eventHave with youRome The Capitoltwoto lay cushions as it were in the CapitolCome come they are almost here How many stand for consulshipsThree they say but 'tis thought of every one Coriolanus will carry itThat's a brave fellow but he's vengeance proud and loves not the common peopleFaith there have been many great men that have flatter'd the people who ne'er loved them and there be many that they have loved they know not wherefore so that if they love they know not why they hate upon no better a ground Therefore for Coriolanus neither to care whether they love or hate him manifests the true knowledge he has in their disposition and out of his noble carelessness lets them plainly see'tIf he did not care whether he had their love or no he waved indifferently 'twixt doing them neither good nor harm but he seeks their hate with greater devotion than they can render it him and leaves nothing undone that may fully discover him their opposite Now to seem to affect the malice and displeasure of the people is as bad as that which he dislikes to flatter them for their loveHe hath deserved worthily of his country and his ascent is not by such easy degrees as those who having been supple and courteous to the people bonneted without any further deed to have them at all into their estimation and report but he hath so planted his honours in their eyes and his actions in their hearts that for their tongues to be silent and not confess so much were a kind of ingrateful injury to report otherwise were a malice that giving itself the lie would pluck reproof and rebuke from every car that heard itNo more of him he's a worthy man Make way they are comingA sennetthe and the before them the Consul andtake their places by themselvesstandsHaving determin'd of the Volsces and To send for Titus Lartius it remains As the main point of this our aftermeeting To gratify his noble service that Hath thus stood for his country Therefore please you Most reverend and grave elders to desire The present consul and last general In our wellfound successes to report A little of that worthy work perform'd By Caius Marcius Coriolanus whom We met here both to thank and to remember With honours like himself sitsSpeak good Cominius Leave nothing out for length and make us think Rather our state's defective for requital Than we to stretch it out Masters o' th' people We do request your kindest ears and after Your loving motion toward the common body To yield what passes hereWe are convented Upon a pleasing treaty and have hearts Inclinable to honour and advance The theme of our assemblyWhich the rather We shall be bless'd to do if he remember A kinder value of the people than He hath hereto priz'd them atThat's off that's off I would you rather had been silent Please you To hear Cominius speakMost willingly But yet my caution was more pertinent Than the rebuke you give itHe loves your people But tie him not to be their bedfellow Worthy Cominius speakrises and offers to go away Nay keep your placeSit Coriolanus never shame to hear What you have nobly doneYour Honours' pardon I had rather have my wounds to heal again Than hear say how I got themSir I hope My words disbench'd you notNo sir yet oft When blows have made me stay I fled from words You sooth'd not therefore hurt not But your people I love them as they weighPray now sit downI had rather have one scratch my head i' th' sun When the alarum were struck than idly sit To hear my nothings monster'dMasters of the people Your multiplying spawn how can he flatter That's thousand to one good one when you now see He had rather venture all his limbs for honour Than one on's ears to hear it Proceed CominiusI shall lack voice the deeds of Coriolanus Should not be utter'd feebly It is held That valour is the chiefest virtue and Most dignifies the haver If it be The man I speak of cannot in the world Be singly counterpois'd At sixteen years When Tarquin made a head for Rome he fought Beyond the mark of others our then Dictator Whom with all praise I point at saw him fight When with his Amazonian chin he drove The bristled lips before him he bestrid An o'erpress'd Roman and i' th' consul's view Slew three opposers Tarquin's self he met And struck him on his knee In that day's feats When he might act the woman in the scene He prov'd best man i' th' field and for his meed Was browbound with the oak His pupil age Manent'red thus he waxed like a sea And in the brunt of seventeen battles since He lurch'd all swords of the garland For this last Before and in Corioli let me say I cannot speak him home He stopp'd the fliers And by his rare example made the coward Turn terror into sport as weeds before A vessel under sail so men obey'd And fell below his stem His sword death's stamp Where it did mark it took from face to foot He was a thing of blood whose every motion Was tim'd with dying cries Alone he ent'red The mortal gate of th' city which he painted With shunless destiny aidless came off And with a sudden reenforcement struck Corioli like a planet Now all's his When by and by the din of war 'gan pierce His ready sense then straight his doubled spirit Requick'ned what in flesh was fatigate And to the battle came he where he did Run reeking o'er the lives of men as if 'Twere a perpetual spoil and till we call'd Both field and city ours he never stood To ease his breast with pantingWorthy manHe cannot but with measure fit the honours Which we devise himOur spoils he kick'd at And look'd upon things precious as they were The common muck of the world He covets less Than misery itself would give rewards His deeds with doing them and is content To spend the time to end itHe's right noble Let him be call'd forCall CoriolanusHe doth appear Re The Senate Coriolanus are well pleas'd To make thee consulI do owe them still My life and servicesIt then remains That you do speak to the peopleI do beseech you Let me o'erleap that custom for I cannot Put on the gown stand naked and entreat them For my wounds' sake to give their suffrage Please you That I may pass this doingSir the people Must have their voices neither will they bate One jot of ceremonyPut them not to't

Rome The Forumseven or eight citizensOnce if he do require our voices we ought not to deny himWe may sir if we willWe have power in ourselves to do it but it is a power that we have no power to do for if he show us his wounds and tell us his deeds we are to put our tongues into those wounds and speak for them so if he tell us his noble deeds we must also tell him our noble acceptance of them Ingratitude is monstrous and for the multitude to be ingrateful were to make a monster of the multitude of the which we being members should bring ourselves to be monstrous membersAnd to make us no better thought of a little help will serve for once we stood up about the corn he himself stuck not to call us the manyheaded multitudeWe have been call'd so of many not that our heads are some brown some black some abram some bald but that our wits are so diversely colour'd and truly I think if all our wits were to issue out of one skull they would fly east west north south and their consent of one direct way should be at once to all the points o' th' compassThink you so Which way do you judge my wit would flyNay your wit will not so soon out as another man's will 'tis strongly wedg'd up in

enemies you have been a rod to her friends You have not indeed loved the common peopleYou should account me the more virtuous that I have not been common in my love I will sir flatter my sworn brother the people to earn a dearer estimation of them 'tis a condition they account gentle and since the wisdom of their choice is rather to have my hat than my heart I will practise the insinuating nod and be off to them most counterfeitly That is sir I will counterfeit the bewitchment of some popular man and give it bountiful to the desirers Therefore beseech you I may be consulWe hope to find you our friend and therefore give you our voices heartilyYou have received many wounds for your countryI will not seal your knowledge with showing them I will make much of your voices and so trouble you no fartherThe gods give you joy sir heartily citizensMost sweet voices Better it is to die better to starve Than crave the hire which first we do deserve Why in this wolvish toge should I stand here To beg of Hob and Dick that do appear Their needless vouches Custom calls me to't What custom wills in all things should we do't The dust on antique time would lie unswept And mountainous error be too

our voices sirWe pray the gods he may deserve your lovesAmen sir To my poor unworthy notice He mock'd us when he begg'd our voicesCertainly He flouted us downrightNo 'tis his kind of speech he did not mock usNot one amongst us save yourself but says He us'd us scornfully He should have show'd us His marks of merit wounds receiv'd for's countryWhy so he did I am sureNo no no man saw 'emHe said he had wounds which he could show in private And with his hat thus waving it in scorn 'I would be consul' says he 'aged custom But by your voices will not so permit me Your voices therefore' When we granted that Here was 'I thank you for your voices Thank you Your most sweet voices Now you have left your voices I have no further with you' Was not this mockeryWhy either were you ignorant to see't Or seeing it of such childish friendliness To yield your voicesCould you not have told him As you were lesson'd when he had no power But was a petty servant to the state He was your enemy ever spake against Your liberties and the charters that you bear I' th' body of the weal and now arriving A place of potency and sway o' th' state If he should still malignantly remain Fast foe to th' plebeii your voices might Be curses to yourselves You should have said That as his worthy deeds did claim no less Than what he stood for so his gracious nature Would think upon you for your voices and Translate his malice towards you into love Standing your friendly lordThus to have said As you were foreadvis'd had touch'd his spirit And tried his inclination from him pluck'd Either his gracious promise which you might As cause had call'd you up have held him to Or else it would have gall'd his surly nature Which easily endures not article Tying him to aught So putting him to rage You should have ta'en th' advantage of his choler And pass'd him unelectedDid you perceive He did solicit you in free contempt When he did need your loves and do you think That his contempt shall not be bruising to you When he hath power to crush Why had your bodies No heart among you Or had you tongues to cry Against the rectorship of judgmentHave you Ere now denied the asker and now again Of him that did

he's a limb that has but a disease Mortal to cut it off to cure it easy What has he done to Rome that's worthy death Killing our enemies the blood he hath lost Which I dare vouch is more than that he hath By many an ounce he dropt it for his country And what is left to lose it by his country Were to us all that do't and suffer it A brand to th' end o' th' worldThis is clean kamMerely awry When he did love his country It honour'd himThe service of the foot Being once gangren'd is not then respected For what before it wasWe'll hear no more Pursue him to his house and pluck him thence Lest his

process Lest parties as he is belov'd break out And sack great Rome with RomansIf it were soWhat do ye talk Have we not had a taste of his obedience Our aediles smote ourselves resisted ComeConsider this he has been bred i' th' wars Since 'a could draw a sword and is ill school'd In bolted language meal and bran together He throws without distinction Give me leave I'll go to him and undertake to bring him Where he shall answer by a lawful form In peace to his utmost perilNoble Tribunes It is the humane way the other course Will prove too bloody and the end of it Unknown to the beginningNoble

bring him to you To the Let me desire your company he must come Or what is worst will followPray you let's to him Rome The house of with Let them pull all about mine ears present me Death on the wheel or at wild horses' heels Or pile ten hills on the Tarpeian rock That the precipitation might down stretch Below the beam of sight yet will I still Be thus to themYou do the noblerI muse my mother Does not approve me further who was wont To call them woollen vassals things created To buy and sell with groats to show bare heads In congregations to yawn be still and wonder When one but of my ordinance stood up To speak of peace or war I talk of you Why did you wish me milder Would you have me False to my nature Rather say I play The man I amO sir sir sir I would have had you put your power well on Before you had worn it outLet goYou might have been enough the man you are With striving less to be so lesser had been The thwartings of your dispositions if You had not show'd them how ye were dispos'd Ere they lack'd power to cross youLet them hangAy and burn toowith the Come come you have been too rough something too rough You must return and mend itThere's no remedy Unless by not so doing our good city Cleave in the midst and perishPray be counsell'd I have a heart as little apt as yours But yet a brain that leads my use of anger To better vantageWell said noble woman Before he should thus stoop to th' herd but that The violent fit o' th' time craves it as physic For the whole state I would put mine armour on Which I can scarcely bearWhat must I doReturn to th' tribunesWell what then what thenRepent what you have spokeFor them I cannot do it to the gods Must I then do't to themYou are too absolute Though therein you can never be too noble But when extremities speak I have heard you say Honour and policy like unsever'd friends I' th' war do grow together grant that and tell me In peace what each of them by th' other lose That they combine not thereTush tushA good demandIf it be honour in your wars to seem The same you are not which for your best ends You adopt your policy how is it less or worse That it shall hold companionship in peace With honour as in war since that to both It stands in like requestWhy force you thisBecause that now it lies you on to speak To th' people not by your own instruction Nor by th' matter which your heart prompts you But with such words that are but roted in Your tongue though but bastards and syllables Of no allowance to your bosom's truth Now this no more dishonours you at all Than to take in a town with gentle words Which else would put you to your fortune and The hazard of much blood I would dissemble with my nature where My fortunes and my friends at stake requir'd I should do so in honour I am in this Your wife your son these senators the nobles And you will rather show our general louts How you can frown than spend a fawn upon 'em For the inheritance of their loves and safeguard Of what that want might ruinNoble lady Come go with us speak fair you may salve so Not what is dangerous present but the los Of what is pastI prithee now My son Go to them with this bonnet in thy hand And thus far having stretch'd it here be with them Thy knee bussing the stones for in such busines Action is eloquence and the eyes of th' ignorant More learned than the ears waving thy head Which often thus correcting thystout heart Now humble as the ripest mulberry That will not hold the handling Or say to them Thou art their soldier and being bred in broils Hast not the soft way which thou dost confess Were fit for thee to use as they to claim In asking their good loves but thou wilt frame Thyself forsooth hereafter theirs so far As thou hast power and personThis but done Even as she speaks why their hearts were yours For they have pardons being ask'd as free As words to little purposePrithee now Go and be rul'd although I know thou hadst rather Follow thine enemy in a fiery gulf Than flatter him in a bowerHere is CominiusI have been i' th' marketplace and sir 'tis fit You make strong party or defend yourself By calmness or by absence all's in angerOnly fair speechI think 'twill serve if he Can thereto frame his spiritHe must and will Prithee now say you will and go about itMust I go show them my unbarb'd sconce Must I With my base tongue give to my noble heart A lie that it must bear Well I will do't Yet were there but this single plot to lose This mould of Marcius they to dust should grind it And throw't against the wind To th' marketplace You have put me now to such a part which never I shall discharge to th' lifeCome come we'll prompt youI prithee now sweet son as thou hast said My praises made thee first a soldier so To have my praise for this perform a part Thou hast not done beforeWell I must do't Away my disposition and possess me Some harlot's spirit My throat of war be turn'd Which quier'd with my drum into a pipe Small as an eunuch or the virgin voice That babies lulls asleep The smiles of knaves Tent in my cheeks and schoolboys' tears take up The glasses of my sight A beggar's tongue Make motion through my lips and my arm'd knees Who bow'd but in my stirrup bend like his That hath receiv'd an alms I will not do't Lest I surcease to honour mine own truth And by my body's action teach my mind A most inherent basenessAt thy choice then To beg of thee it is my more dishonour Than thou of them Come all to ruin Let Thy mother rather feel thy pride than fear Thy dangerous stoutness for I mock at death With as big heart as thou Do as thou list Thy valiantness was mine thou suck'dst it from me But owe thy pride thyselfPray be content Mother I am going to the marketplace Chide me no more I'll mountebank their loves Cog their hearts from them and come home belov'd Of all the trades in Rome Look I am going Commend me to my wife I'll return consul Or never trust to what my tongue can do I' th' way of flattery furtherDo your will Away The tribunes do attend you Arm yourself To answer mildly for they are prepar'd With accusations as I hear more strong Than are upon you yetThe word is 'mildly' Pray you let us go Let them accuse me by invention I Will answer in mine honourAy but mildlyWell mildly be it then mildlyRome The Forumand In this point charge him home that he affects Tyrannical power If he evade us there Enforce him with his envy to the people And that the spoil got on the Antiates Was ne'er distributed anWhat will he comeHe's comingHow accompaniedWith old Menenius and those senators That always favour'd himHave you a catalogue Of all the voices that we have procur'd Set down by th' pollI have 'tis readyHave you corrected them by tribesI haveAssemble presently the people hither And when they hear me say 'It shall be so I' th' right and strength o' th' commons' be it either For death for fine or banishment then let them If I say fine cry 'Fine' if death cry 'Death' Insisting on the old prerogative And power i' th' truth o' th' causeI shall inform themAnd when such time they have begun to cry Let them not cease but with a din confus'd Enforce the present execution Of what we chance to sentenceVery wellMake them be strong and ready for this hint When we shall hap to give't themGo about it Put him to choler straight He hath been us'd Ever to conquer and to have his worth Of contradiction being once chaf'd

shall be prov'd upon youI am contentLo citizens he says he is content The warlike service he has done consider think Upon the wounds his body bears which show Like graves i' th' holy churchyardScratches with briers Scars to move laughter onlyConsider further That when he speaks not like a citizen You find him like a soldier do not take His rougher accents for malicious sounds But as I say such as become a soldier Rather than envy youWell well No moreWhat is the matter That being pass'd for consul with full voice I am so dishonour'd that the very hour You take it off againAnswer to usSay then 'tis true I ought soWe charge you that you have contriv'd to take From Rome all season'd office and to wind Yourself into a power tyrannical For which you are a traitor to the peopleHow traitorNay temperately Your promiseThe fires i' th' lowest hell fold in the people Call me their traitor Thou injurious tribune Within thine eyes sat twenty thousand deaths In thy hands clutch'd as many millions in Thy lying tongue both numbers I would say 'Thou liest' unto thee with a voice as free As I do pray the godsMark you this peopleTo th' rock to th' rock with himPeace We need not put new matter to his charge What you have seen him do and heard him speak Beating your officers cursing yourselves Opposing laws with strokes and here defying Those whose great power must try him even this So criminal and in such capital kind Deserves th' extremest deathBut since he hath Serv'd well for RomeWhat do you prate of serviceI talk of that that know itYouIs this the promise that you made your motherKnow I pray youI'll know no further Let them pronounce the steep Tarpeian death Vagabond exile flaying pent to linger But with a grain a day I would not buy Their mercy at the price of one fair word Nor check my courage for what they can give To have't with saying 'Good morrow'For that he has As much as in him lies from time to time Envied against the people seeking means To pluck away their power as now at last Given hostile strokes and that not in the presence Of dreaded justice but on the ministers That do distribute it in the name o' th' people And in the power of us the tribunes we Ev'n from this instant banish him our city In peril of precipitation From off the rock Tarpeian never more Toour Rome gates I' th' people's name I say it shall be soIt shall be so it shall be so Let him away He's banish'd and it shall be soHear me my masters and my common friendsHe's sentenc'd no more hearingLet me speak I have been consul and can show for Rome Her enemies' marks upon me I do love My country's good with a respect more tender More holy and profound than mine own life My dear wife's estimate her womb's increase And treasure of my loins Then if I would Speak thatWe know your drift Speak whatThere's no more to be said but he is banish'd As enemy to the people and his country It shall be soIt shall be so it shall be socommon cry of curs whose breath I hate As reek o' th' rotten fens whose loves I prize As the dead carcasses of unburied men That do corrupt my air I banish you And here remain with your uncertainty Let every feeble rumour shake your hearts Your enemies with nodding of their plumes Fan you into despair Have the power still To banish your defenders till at length Your ignorance which finds not till it feels Making but reservation of yourselves Still your own foes deliver you As most abated captives to some nation That won you without blows Despising For you the city thus I turn my back There is a world elsewherewith the other The people's enemy is gone is gone They all shout and throw up their capsOur enemy is banish'd he is gone HooooGo see him out at gates and follow him As he hath follow'd you with all despite Give him deserv'd vexation Let a guard Attend us through the cityCome come let's see him out at gates come The gods preserve our noble tribunes Come
