IlThe house of wife to withher sisterNeither my husband nor the slave return'd That in such haste I sent to seek his master Sure Luciana it is two o'clockPerhaps some merchant hath invited him And from the mart he's somewhere gone to dinner Good sister let us dine and never fret A man is master of his liberty Time is their master and when they see time They'll go or come If so be patient sisterWhy should their liberty than ours be moreBecause their business still lies out o' doorLook when I serve him so he takes it illO know he is the bridle of your willThere's none but asses will be bridled soWhy headstrong liberty is lash'd with woe There's nothing situate under heaven's eye But hath his bound in earth in sea in sky The beasts the fishes and the winged fowls Are their males' subjects and at their controls Man more divine the master of all these Lord of the wide world and wild wat'ry seas Indu'd with intellectual sense and souls Of more preeminence than fish and fowls Are masters to their females and their lords Then let your will attend on their accordsThis servitude makes you to keep unwedNot this but troubles of the marriagebedBut were you wedded you would bear some swayEre I learn love I'll practise to obeyHow if your husband start some other whereTill he come home again I would forbearPatience unmov'd no marvel though she pause They can be meek that have no other cause A wretched soul bruis'd with adversity We bid be quiet when we hear it cry But were we burd'ned with like weight of pain As much or more we should ourselves complain So thou that hast no unkind mate to grieve thee With urging helpless patience would relieve me But if thou live to see like right bereft This foolbegg'd patience in thee will be leftWell I will marry one day but to try Here comes your man now is your husband nigh Say is your tardy master now at hand Nay he's at two hands with me and that my two ears can witnessSay didst thou speak with him Know'st thou his mind Ay ay he told his mind upon mine ear Beshrew his hand I scarce could understand itSpake he so doubtfully thou could'st not feel his meaning Nay he struck so plainly I could to well feel his blows and withal so doubtfully that I could scarce understand themBut say I prithee is he coming home It seems he hath great care to please his wife Why mistress sure my master is hornmadHornmad thou villain I mean not cuckoldmad But sure he is stark mad When I desir'd him to come home to dinner He ask'd me for a thousand marks in gold Tis dinner time' quoth I 'My gold' quoth he 'Your meat doth burn' quoth I 'My gold' quoth he 'Will you come home' quoth I 'My gold' quoth he 'Where is the thousand marks I gave thee villain' 'The pig' quoth I 'is burn'd' 'My gold' quoth he 'My mistress sir' quoth I 'Hang up thy mistress I know not thy mistress out on thy mistress'Quoth who Quoth my master 'I know' quoth he 'no house no wife no mistress' So that my errand due unto my tongue I thank him I bare home upon my shoulders For in conclusion he did beat me thereGo back again thou slave and fetch him home Go back again and be new beaten home For God's sake send some other messengerBack slave or I will break thy pate across And he will bless that cross with other beating Between you I shall have a holy headHence prating peasant Fetch thy master home Am I so round with you as you with me That like a football you do spurn me thus You spurn me hence and he will spurn me hither If I last in this service you must case me in leather Fie how impatience loureth in your faceHis company must do his minions grace Whilst I at home starve for a merry look Hath homely age th' alluring beauty took From my poor cheek Then he hath wasted it Are my discourses dull Barren my wit If voluble and sharp discourse be marr'd Unkindness blunts it more than marble hard Do their gay vestments his affections bait That's not my fault he's master of my state What ruins are in me that can be found By him not ruin'd Then is he the ground Of my defeatures My decayed fair A sunny look of his would soon repair But too unruly deer he breaks the pale And feeds from home poor I am but his staleSelfharming jealousy fie beat it henceUnfeeling fools can with such wrongs dispense I know his eye doth homage otherwhere Or else what lets it but he would be here Sister you know he promis'd me a chain Would that alone a love he would detain So he would keep fair quarter with his bed I see the jewel best enamelled Will lose his beauty yet the gold bides still That others touch and often touching will Where gold and no man that hath a name By falsehood and corruption doth it shame Since that my beauty cannot please his eye I'll weep what's left away and weeping dieHow many fond fools serve mad jealousy The martThe gold I gave to Dromio is laid up Safe at the Centaur and the heedful slave Is wand'red forth in care to seek me out By computation and mine host's report I could not speak with Dromio since at first I sent him from the mart See here he comesHow now sir is your merry humour alter'd As you love strokes so jest with me again You know no Centaur You receiv'd no gold Your mistress sent to have me home to dinner My house was at the Phoenix Wast thou mad That thus so madly thou didst answer me What answer sir When spake I such a word Even now even here not half an hour since I did not see you since you sent me hence Home to the Centaur with the gold you gave me Villain thou didst deny the gold's receipt And told'st me of a mistress and a dinner For which I hope thou felt'st I was displeas'd I am glad to see you in this merry vein What means this jest I pray you master tell me Yea dost thou jeer and flout me in the teeth Think'st thou I jest Hold take thou that and that Beating him Hold sir for God's sake Now your jest is earnest Upon what bargain do you give it me Because that I familiarly sometimes Do use you for my fool and chat with you Your sauciness will jest upon my love And make a common of my serious hours When the sun shines let foolish gnats make sport But creep in crannies when he hides his beams If you will jest with me know my aspect And fashion your demeanour to my looks Or I will beat this method in your sconce Sconce call you it So you would leave battering I had rather have it a head An you use these blows long I must get a sconce for my head and insconce it too or else I shall seek my wit in my shoulders But I pray sir why am I beaten Dost thou not know Nothing sir but that I am beaten Shall I tell you why Ay sir and wherefore for they say every why hath a wherefore Why first for flouting me and then wherefore For urging it the second time to me Was there ever any man thus beaten out of season When in the why and the wherefore is neither rhyme nor reason Well sir I thank you Thank me sir for what Marry sir for this something that you gave me for nothing I'll make you amends next to give you nothing for something But say sir is it dinnertime No sir I think the meat wants that I have In good time sir what's that Basting Well sir then 'twill be dry If it be sir I pray you eat none of it Your reason Lest it make you choleric and purchase me another dry basting Well sir learn to jest in good time there's a time for all things I durst have denied that before you were so choleric By what rule sir Marry sir by a rule as plain as the plain bald pate of Father Time himself Let's hear it There's no time for a man to recover his hair that grows bald by nature May he not do it by fine and recovery Yes to pay a fine for a periwig and recover the lost hair of another man Why is Time such a niggard of hair being as it is so plentiful an excrement Because it is a blessing that he bestows on beasts and what he hath scanted men in hair he hath given them in wit Why but there's many a man hath more hair than wit Not a man of those but he hath the wit to lose his hair Why thou didst conclude hairy men plain dealers without wit The plainer dealer the sooner lost yet he loseth it in a kind of jollity For what reason For two and sound ones too Nay not sound I pray you Sure ones then Nay not sure in a thing falsing Certain ones then Name them The one to save the money that he spends in tiring the other that at dinner they should not drop in his porridge You would all this time have prov'd there is no time for all things Marry and did sir namely no time to recover hair lost by nature But your reason was not substantial why there is no time to recover Thus I mend it Time himself is bald and therefore to the world's end will have bald followers I knew 't'would be a bald conclusion But soft who wafts us yonderand Ay ay Antipholus look strange and frown Some other mistress hath thy sweet aspects I am not Adriana nor thy wife The time was once when thou unurg'd wouldst vow That never words were music to thine ear That never object pleasing in thine eye That never touch well welcome to thy hand That never meat sweetsavour'd in thy taste Unless I spake or look'd or touch'd or carv'd to thee How comes it now my husband O how comes it That thou art then estranged from thyself Thyself I call it being strange to me That undividable incorporate Am better than thy dear self's better part Ah do not tear away thyself from me For know my love as easy mayst thou fall A drop of water in the breaking gulf And take unmingled thence that drop again Without addition or diminishing As take from me thyself and not me too How dearly would it touch thee to the quick Should'st thou but hear I were licentious And that this body consecrate to thee By ruffian lust should be contaminate Wouldst thou not spit at me and spurn at me And hurl the name of husband in my face And tear the stain'd skin off my harlotbrow And from my false hand cut the weddingring And break it with a deepdivorcing vow I know thou canst and therefore see thou do it I am possess'd with an adulterate blot My blood is mingled with the crime of lust For if we two be one and thou play false I do digest the poison of thy flesh Being strumpeted by thy contagion Keep then fair league and truce with thy true bed I live disstain'd thou undishonoured Plead you to me fair dame I know you not In Ephesus I am but two hours old As strange unto your town as to your talk Who every word by all my wit being scann'd Wants wit in all one word to understandFie brother how the world is chang'd with you When were you wont to use my sister thus She sent for you by Dromio home to dinner By Dromio By meBy thee and this thou didst return from him That he did buffet thee and in his blows Denied my house for his me for his wife Did you converse sir with this gentlewoman What is the course and drift of your compact I Sir I never saw her till this time Villain thou liest for even her very words Didst thou deliver to me on the mart I never spake with her in all my life How can she thus then call us by our names Unless it be by inspirationHow ill agrees it with your gravity To counterfeit thus grossly with your slave Abetting him to thwart me in my mood Be it my wrong you are from me exempt But wrong not that wrong with a more contempt Come I will fasten on this sleeve of thine Thou art an elm my husband I a vine Whose weakness married to thy stronger state Makes me with thy strength to communicate If aught possess thee from me it is dross Usurping ivy brier or idle moss Who all for want of pruning with intrusion Infect thy sap and live on thy confusion To me she speaks she moves me for her theme What was I married to her in my dream Or sleep I now and think I hear all this What error drives our eyes and ears amiss Until I know this sure uncertainty I'll tain the offer'd fallacyDromio go bid the servants spread for dinner O for my beads I cross me for sinner This is the fairy land O spite of spites We talk with goblins owls and sprites If we obey them not this will ensue They'll suck our breath or pinch us black and blueWhy prat'st thou to thyself and answer'st not Dromio thou drone thou snail thou slug thou sot I am transformed master am not I I think thou art in mind and so amNay master both in mind and in my shape Thou hast thine own form No I am an apeIf thou art chang'd to aught 'tis to an ass 'Tis true she rides me and I long for grass 'Tis so I am an ass else it could never be But I should know her as well as she knows meCome come no longer will I be a fool To put the finger in the eye and weep Whilst man and master laughs my woes to scorn Come sir to dinner Dromio keep the gate Husband I'll dine above with you today And shrive you of a thousand idle pranks Sirrah if any ask you for your master Say he dines forth and let no creatureCome sister Dromio play the porter well Am I in earth in heaven or in hell Sleeping or waking mad or welladvis'd Known unto these and to myself disguis'd I'll say as they say and persever so And in this mist at all adventures go Master shall I be porter at the gateAy and let nonelest I break your pateCome come Antipholus we dine too late
