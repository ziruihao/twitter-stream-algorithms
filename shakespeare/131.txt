butcher's offal and to be thrown in the Thames Well if I be serv'd such another trick I'll have my brains ta'en out and butter'd and give them to a dog for a newyear's gift The rogues slighted me into the river with as little remorse as they would have drown'd a blind bitch's puppies fifteen i' th' litter and you may know by my size that I have a kind of alacrity in sinking if the bottom were as deep as hell I should down I had been drown'd but that the shore was shelvy and shallowa death that I abhor for the water swells a man and what a thing should I have been when had been swell'd I should have been a mountain of mummy Rewith sackHere's Mistress Quickly sir to speak with youCome let me pour in some sack to the Thames water for my belly's as cold as if I had swallow'd snowballs for pills to cool the reins Call her inCome in woman By your leave I cry you mercy Give your worship good morrowTake away these chalices Go brew me a pottle of sack finelyWith eggs sirSimple of itself I'll no pulletsperm in my brewage How nowMarry sir I come to your worship from Mistress FordMistress Ford I have had ford enough I was thrown into the ford I have my belly full of fordAlas the day good heart that was not her fault She does so take on with her men they mistook their erectionSo did I mine to build upon a foolish woman's promiseWell she laments sir for it that it would yearn your heart to see it Her husband goes this morning abirding she desires you once more to come to her between eight and nine I must carry her word quickly She'll make you amends I warrant youWell I Will visit her Tell her so and bid her think what a man is Let her consider his frailty and then judge of my meritI will tell herDo so Between nine and ten say'st thouEight and nine sirWell be gone I will not miss herPeace be with you sirI marvel I hear not of Master Brook he sent me word to stay within I like his money well O here he comes disguisedBless you sirNow Master Brook you come to know what hath pass'd between me and Ford's wifeThat indeed Sir John is my businessMaster Brook I will not lie to you I was at her house the hour she appointed meAnd sped you sirVery illfavouredly Master BrookHow so sir did she change her determinationNo Master Brook but the peaking cornuto her husband Master Brook dwelling in a continual 'larum of jealousy comes me in the instant of our encounter after we had embrac'd kiss'd protested and as it were spoke the prologue of our comedy and at his heels a rabble of his companions thither provoked and instigated by his distemper and forsooth to search his house for his wife's loveWhat while you were thereWhile I was thereAnd did he search for you and could not find youYou shall hear As good luck would have it comes in one Mistress Page gives intelligence of Ford's approach and in her invention and Ford's wife's distraction they convey'd me into a buckbasketA buckbasketBy the Lord a buckbasket Ramm'd me in with foul shirts and smocks socks foul stockings greasy napkins that Master Brook there was the rankest compound of villainous smell that ever offended nostrilAnd how long lay you thereNay you shall hear Master Brook what I have suffer'd to bring this woman to evil for your good Being thus cramm'd in the basket a couple of Ford's knaves his hinds were call'd forth by their mistress to carry me in the name of foul clothes to Datchet Lane they took me on their shoulders met the jealous knave their master in the door who ask'd them once or twice what they had in their basket I quak'd for fear lest the lunatic knave would have search'd it but Fate ordaining he should be a cuckold held his hand Well on went he for a search and away went I for foul clothes But mark the sequel Master BrookI suffered the pangs of three several deaths first an intolerable fright to be detected with a jealous rotten bellwether next to be compass'd like a good bilbo in the circumference of a peck hilt to point heel to head and then to be stopp'd in like a strong distillation with stinking clothes that fretted in their own grease Think of that a man of my kidney Think of thatthat am as subject to heat as butter a man of continual dissolution and thaw It was a miracle to scape suffocation And in the height of this bath when I was more than halfstew'd in grease like a Dutch dish to be thrown into the Thames and cool'd glowing hot in that surge like a horseshoe think of that hissing hot Think of that Master BrookIn good sadness sir I am sorry that for my sake you have suffer'd all this My suit then is desperate you'll undertake her no moreMaster Brook I will be thrown into Etna as I have been into Thames ere I will leave her thus Her husband is this morning gone abirding I have received from her another embassy of meeting 'twixt eight and nine is the hour Master Brook'Tis past eight already sirIs it I Will then address me to my appointment Come to me at your convenient leisure and you shall know how I speed and the conclusion shall be crowned with your enjoying her Adieu You shall have her Master Brook Master Brook you shall cuckold FordHum ha Is this a vision Is this a dream Do I sleep Master Ford awake awake Master Ford There's a hole made in your best coat Master Ford This 'tis to be married this 'tis to have linen and buckbaskets Well I will proclaim myself what I am I will now take the lecher he is at my house He cannot scape me 'tis impossible he should he cannot creep into a halfpenny purse nor into a pepper box But lest the devil that guides him should aid him I will search impossible places Though what I am I cannot avoid yet to be what I would not shall not make me tame If I have horns to make one mad let the proverb go with meI'll be horn mad
