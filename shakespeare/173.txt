Before o houseasasandTo Signior Lucentio this is the 'pointed day That Katherine and Petruchio should be married And yet we hear not of our soninlaw What will be said What mockery will it be To want the bridegroom when the priest attends To speak the ceremonial rites of marriage What says Lucentio to this shame of oursNo shame but mine I must forsooth be forc'd To give my hand oppos'd against my heart Unto a madbrain rudesby full of spleen Who woo'd in haste and means to wed at leisure I told you I he was a frantic fool Hiding his bitter jests in blunt behaviour And to be noted for a merry man He'll woo a thousand 'point the day of marriage Make friends invited and proclaim the banns Yet never means to wed where he hath woo'd Now must the world point at poor Katherine And say 'Lo there is mad Petruchio's wife If it would please him come and marry her'Patience good Katherine and Baptista too Upon my life Petruchio means but well Whatever fortune stays him from his word Though he be blunt I know him passing wise Though he be merry yet withal he's honestWould Katherine had never seen him thoughweeping followed by and othersGo girl I cannot blame thee now to weep For such an injury would vex a very saint Much more a shrew of thy impatient humourMaster master News and such old news as you never heard ofIs it new and old too How may that beWhy is it not news to hear of Petruchio's comingIs he comeWhy no sirWhat thenHe is comingWhen will he be hereWhen he stands where I am and sees you thereBut say what to thine old newsWhy Petruchio is coming in a new hat and an old jerkin a pair of old breeches thrice turn'd a pair of boots that have been candlecases one buckled another lac'd an old rusty sword ta'en out of the town armoury with a broken hilt and chapeless with two broken points his horse hipp'd with an old motley saddle and stirrups of no kindred besides possess'd with the glanders and like to mose in the chine troubled with the lampass infected with the fashions full of windgalls sped with spavins rayed with the yellows past cure of the fives stark spoil'd with the staggers begnawn with the bots sway'd in the back and shouldershotten nearlegg'd before and with a halfcheek'd bit and a headstall of sheep's leather which being restrained to keep him from stumbling hath been often burst and now repaired with knots one girth six times piec'd and a woman's crupper of velure which hath two letters for her name fairly set down in studs and here and there piec'd with packthreadWho comes with himO sir his lackey for all the world caparison'd like the horse with a linen stock on one leg and a kersey boothose on the other gart'red with a red and blue list an old hat and the humour of forty fancies prick'd in't for a feather a monster a very monster in apparel and not like a Christian footboy or a gentleman's lackey'Tis some odd humour pricks him to this fashion Yet oftentimes lie goes but meanapparell'dI am glad he's come howsoe'er he comesWhy sir he comes notDidst thou not say he comesWho that Petruchio cameAy that Petruchio cameNo sir I say his horse comes with him on his backWhy that's all oneNay by Saint JamyI hold you a pennyA horse and a manIs more than oneAnd yet not manyand Come where be these gallants Who's at homeYou are welcome sirAnd yet I come not wellAnd yet you halt notNot so well apparell'd As I wish you wereWere it better I should rush in thus But where is Kate Where is my lovely bride How does my father Gentles methinks you frown And wherefore gaze this goodly company As if they saw some wondrous monument Some comet or unusual prodigyWhy sir you know this is your weddingday First were we sad fearing you would not come Now sadder that you come so unprovided Fie doff this habit shame to your estate An eyesore to our solemn festivalAnd tell us what occasion of import Hath all so long detain'd you from your wife And sent you hither so unlike yourselfTedious it were to tell and harsh to hear Sufficeth I am come to keep my word Though in some part enforced to digress Which at more leisure I will so excuse As you shall well be satisfied withal But where is Kate I stay too long from her The morning wears 'tis time we were at churchSee not your bride in these unreverent robes Go to my chamber put on clothes of mineNot I believe me thus I'll visit herBut thus I trust you will not marry herGood sooth even thus therefore ha' done with words To me she's married not unto my clothes Could I repair what she will wear in me As I can change these poor accoutrements 'Twere well for Kate and better for myself But what a fool am I to chat with you When I should bid goodmorrow to my bride And seal the title with a lovely kissHe hath some meaning in his mad attire We will persuade him be it possible To put on better ere he go to churchI'll after him and see the event of this and But to her love concerneth us to ad Her father's liking which to bring to pass As I before imparted to your worship I am to get a man whate'er he be It skills not much we'll fit him to our turn And he shall be Vincentio of Pisa And make assurance here in Padua Of greater sums than I have promised So shall you quietly enjoy your hope And marry sweet Bianca with consentWere it not that my fellow schoolmaster Doth watch Bianca's steps so narrowly 'Twere good methinks to steal our marriage Which once perform'd let all the world say no I'll keep mine own despite of all the worldThat by degrees we mean to look into And watch our vantage in this business We'll overreach the greybeard Gremio The

bridegroom coming homeA bridegroom say you 'Tis a groom indeed A grumbling groom and that the girl shall findCurster than she Why 'tis impossibleWhy he's a devil a devil a very fiendWhy she's a devil a devil the devil's damTut she's a lamb a dove a fool to him I'll tell you Sir Lucentio when the priest Should ask if Katherine should be his wife 'Ay by gogswouns' quoth he and swore so loud That all amaz'd the priest let fall the book And as he stoop'd again to take it up This madbrain'd bridegroom took him such a cuff That down fell priest and book and book and priest 'Now take them up' quoth he 'if any list'What said the wench when he rose againTrembled and shook for why he stamp'd and swore As if the vicar meant to cozen him But after many ceremonies done He calls for wine 'A health' quoth he as if He had been abroad carousing to his mates After a storm quaff'd off the muscadel And threw the sops all in the sexton's face Having no other reason But that his beard grew thin and hungerly And seem'd to ask him sops as he was drinking This done he took the bride about the neck And kiss'd her lips with such a clamorous smack That at the parting all the church did echo And I seeing this came thence for very shame And after me I know the rout is coming Such a mad marriage never was before Hark hark I hear the minstrels play Music playsand trainGentlemen and friends I thank you for
