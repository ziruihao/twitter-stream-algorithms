 SceneA hall in Leonato's houseLeonato Antonio his Brother Hero his Daughter and Beatrice his Niece and a Kinsman also Margaret and Ursula Leon Was not Count John here at supper Ant I saw him not Beat How tartly that gentleman looks I never can see him but I am heartburn'd an hour after Hero He is of a very melancholy disposition Beat He were an excellent man that were made just in the midway between him and Benedick The one is too like an image and says nothing and the other too like my lady's eldest son evermore tattling Leon Then half Signior Benedick's tongue in Count John's mouth and half Count John's melancholy in Signior Benedick's face Beat With a good leg and a good foot uncle and money enough in his purse such a man would win any woman in the worldif 'a could get her good will Leon By my troth niece thou wilt never get thee a husband if thou be so shrewd of thy tongue Ant In faith she's too curst Beat Too curst is more than curst I shall lessen God's sending that way for it is said 'God sends a curst cow short horns' but to a cow too curst he sends none Leon So by being too curst God will send you no horns Beat Just if he send me no husband for the which blessing I am at him upon my knees every morning and evening Lord I could not endure a husband with a beard on his face I had rather lie in the woollen Leon You may light on a husband that hath no beard Beat What should I do with him dress him in my apparel and make him my waiting gentlewoman He that hath a beard is more than a youth and he that hath no beard is less than a man and he that is more than a youth is not for me and he that is less than a man I am not for him Therefore I will even take sixpence in earnest of the berrord and lead his apes into hell Leon Well then go you into hell Beat No but to the gate and there will the devil meet me like an old cuckold with horns on his head and say 'Get you to heaven Beatrice get you to heaven Here's no place for you maids' So deliver I up my apes and away to Saint Peterfor the heavens He shows me where the bachelors sit and there live we as merry as the day is long Ant to Hero Well niece I trust you will be rul'd by your father Beat Yes faith It is my cousin's duty to make cursy and say 'Father as it please you' But yet for all that cousin let him be a handsome fellow or else make another cursy and say 'Father as it please me' Leon Well niece I hope to see you one day fitted with a husband Beat Not till God make men of some other metal than earth Would it not grieve a woman to be overmaster'd with a piece of valiant dust to make an account of her life to a clod of wayward marl No uncle I'll none Adam's sons are my brethren and truly I hold it a sin to match in my kinred Leon Daughter remember what I told you If the Prince do solicit you in that kind you know your answer Beat The fault will be in the music cousin if you be not wooed in good time If the Prince be too important tell him there is measure in everything and so dance out the answer For hear me Hero wooing wedding and repenting is as a Scotch jig a measure and a cinquepace the first suit is hot and hasty like a Scotch jigand full as fantastical the wedding mannerly modest as a measure full of state and ancientry and then comes Repentance and with his bad legs falls into the cinquepace faster and faster till he sink into his grave Leon Cousin you apprehend passing shrewdly Beat I have a good eye uncle I can see a church by daylight Leon The revellers are ent'ring brother Make good room Antoniomasked Don Pedro Claudio Benedick and BalthasarWith themAntonio also masked After them Don John and Borachio without masks who stand asideand look on during the dance Pedro Lady will you walk a bout with your friend Hero So you walk softly and look sweetly and say nothing I am yours for the walk and especially when I walk away Pedro With me in your company Hero I may say so when I please Pedro And when please you to say so Hero When I like your favour for God defend the lute should be like the case Pedro My visor is Philemon's roof within the house is Jove Hero Why then your visor should be thatch'd Pedro Speak low if you speak love Takes her aside Balth Well I would you did like me Marg So would not I for your own sake for I have many ill qualities Balth Which is one Marg I say my prayers aloud Balth I love you the better The hearers may cry Amen Marg God match me with a good dancer Balth Amen Marg And God keep him out of my sight when the dance is done Answer clerk Balth No more words The clerk is answered Takes her aside Urs I know you well enough You are Signior Antonio Ant At a word I am not Urs I know you by the waggling of your head Ant To tell you true I counterfeit him Urs You could never do him so illwell unless you were the very man Here's his dry hand up and down You are he you are he Ant At a word I am not Urs Come come do you think I do not know you by your excellent wit Can virtue hide itself Go to mum you are he Graces will appear and there's an end They step aside Beat Will you not tell me who told you so Bene No you shall pardon me Beat Nor will you not tell me who you are Bene Not now Beat That I was disdainful and that I had my good wit out of the 'Hundred Merry Tales' Well this was Signior Benedick that said so Bene What's he Beat I am sure you know him well enough Bene Not I believe me Beat Did he never make you laugh Bene I pray you what is he Beat Why he is the Prince's jester a very dull fool Only his gift is in devising impossible slanders None but libertines delight in him and the commendation is not in his wit but in his villany for he both pleases men and angers them and then they laugh at him and beat him I am sure he is in the fleet I would he had boarded me Bene When I know the gentleman I'll tell him what you say Beat Do do He'll but break a comparison or two on me which peradventure not marked or not laugh'd at strikes him into melancholy and then there's a partridge wing saved for the fool will eat no supper that night Music We must follow the leaders Bene In every good thing Beat Nay if they lead to any ill I will leave them at the next turning Danceall but Don John Borachio and Claudio John Sure my brother is amorous on Hero and hath withdrawn her father to break with him about it The ladies follow her and but one visor remains Bora And that is Claudio I know him by his bearing John Are you not Signior Benedick Claud You know me well I am he John Signior you are very near my brother in his love He is enamour'd on Hero I pray you dissuade him from her she is no equal for his birth You may do the part of an honest man in it Claud How know you he loves her John I heard him swear his affection Bora So did I too and he swore he would marry her tonight John Come let us to the banquetManet Claudio Claud Thus answer I in name of Benedick But hear these ill news with the ears of Claudio Unmasks 'Tis certain so The Prince wooes for himself Friendship is constant in all other things Save in the office and affairs of love Therefore all hearts in love use their own tongues Let every eye negotiate for itself And trust no agent for beauty is a witch Against whose charms faith melteth into blood This is an accident of hourly proof Which I mistrusted not Farewell therefore HeroBenedick unmasked Bene Count Claudio Claud Yea the same Bene Come will you go with me Claud Whither Bene Even to the next willow about your own business County What fashion will you wear the garland of about your neck like an usurer's chain or under your arm like a lieutenant's scarf You must wear it one way for the Prince hath got your Hero Claud I wish him joy of her Bene Why that's spoken like an honest drovier So they sell bullocks But did you think the Prince would have served you thus Claud I pray you leave me Bene Ho now you strike like the blind man 'Twas the boy that stole your meat and you'll beat the post Claud If it will not be I'll leave you Bene Alas poor hurt fowl now will he creep into sedges But that my Lady Beatrice should know me and not know me The Prince's fool Ha it may be I go under that title because I am merry Yea but so I am apt to do myself wrong I am not so reputed It is the base though bitter disposition of Beatrice that puts the world into her person and so gives me out Well I'll be revenged as I may Don Pedro Pedro Now signior where's the Count Did you see him Bene Troth my lord I have played the part of Lady Fame I found him here as melancholy as a lodge in a warren I told him and I think I told him true that your Grace had got the good will of this young lady and I off'red him my company to a willow tree either to make him a garland as being forsaken or to bind him up a rod as being worthy to be whipt Pedro To be whipt What's his fault Bene The flat transgression of a schoolboy who being overjoyed with finding a bird's nest shows it his companion and he steals it Pedro Wilt thou make a trust a transgression The transgression is in the stealer Bene Yet it had not been amiss the rod had been made and the garland too for the garland he might have worn himself and the rod he might have bestowed on you who as I take it have stol'n his bird's nest Pedro I will but teach them to sing and restore them to the owner Bene If their singing answer your saying by my faith you say honestly Pedro The Lady Beatrice hath a quarrel to you The gentleman that danc'd with her told her she is much wrong'd by you Bene O she misus'd me past the endurance of a block An oak but with one green leaf on it would have answered her my very visor began to assume life and scold with her She told me not thinking I had been myself that I was the Prince's jester that I was duller than a great thaw huddling jest upon jest with such impossible conveyance upon me that I stood like a man at a mark with a whole army shooting at me She speaks poniards and every word stabs If her breath were as terrible as her terminations there were no living near her she would infect to the North Star I would not marry her though she were endowed with all that Adam had left him before he transgress'd She would have made Hercules have turn'd spit yea and have cleft his club to make the fire too Come talk not of her You shall find her the infernal Ate in good apparel I would to God some scholar would conjure her for certainly while she is here a man may live as quiet in hell as in a sanctuary and people sin upon purpose because they would go thither so indeed all disquiet horror and perturbation follows her Claudio and Beatrice Leonato Hero Pedro Look here she comes Bene Will your Grace command me any service to the world's end I will go on the slightest errand now to the Antipodes that you can devise to send me on I will fetch you a toothpicker now from the furthest inch of Asia bring you the length of Prester John's foot fetch you a hair off the great Cham's beard do you any embassage to the Pygmiesrather than hold three words' conference with this harpy You have no employment for me Pedro None but to desire your good company Bene O God sir here's a dish I love not I cannot endure my Lady Tongue Pedro Come lady come you have lost the heart of Signior Benedick Beat Indeed my lord he lent it me awhile and I gave him use for ita double heart for his single one Marry once before he won it of me with false dice therefore your Grace may well say I have lost it Pedro You have put him down lady you have put him down Beat So I would not he should do me my lord lest I should prove the mother of fools I have brought Count Claudio whom you sent me to seek Pedro Why how now Count Wherefore are you sad Claud Not sad my lord Pedro How then sick Claud Neither my lord Beat The Count is neither sad nor sick nor merry nor well but civil countcivil as an orange and something of that jealous complexion Pedro I' faith lady I think your blazon to be true though I'll be sworn if he be so his conceit is false Here Claudio I have wooed in thy name and fair Hero is won I have broke with her father and his good will obtained Name the day of marriage and God give thee joy Leon Count take of me my daughter and with her my fortunes His Grace hath made the match and all grace say Amen to it Beat Speak Count 'tis your cue Claud Silence is the perfectest herald of joy I were but little happy if I could say how much Lady as you are mine I am yours I give away myself for you and dote upon the exchange Beat Speak cousin or if you cannot stop his mouth with a kiss and let not him speak neither Pedro In faith lady you have a merry heart Beat Yea my lord I thank it poor fool it keeps on the windy side of care My cousin tells him in his ear that he is in her heart Claud And so she doth cousin Beat Good Lord for alliance Thus goes every one to the world but I and I am sunburnt I may sit in a corner and cry 'Heighho for a husband' Pedro Lady Beatrice I will get you one Beat I would rather have one of your father's getting Hath your Grace ne'er a brother like you Your father got excellent husbands if a maid could come by them Pedro Will you have me lady Beat No my lord unless I might have another for working days your Grace is too costly to wear every day But I beseech your Grace pardon me I was born to speak all mirth and no matter Pedro Your silence most offends me and to be merry best becomes you for out o' question you were born in a merry hour Beat No sure my lord my mother cried but then there was a star danc'd and under that was I born Cousins God give you joy Leon Niece will you look to those things I told you of Beat I cry you mercy uncle By your Grace's pardon Pedro By my troth a pleasantspirited lady Leon There's little of the melancholy element in her my lord She is never sad but when she sleeps and not ever sad then for I have heard my daughter say she hath often dreamt of unhappiness and wak'd herself with laughing Pedro She cannot endure to hear tell of a husband Leon O by no means She mocks all her wooers out of suit Pedro She were an excellent wife for Benedick Leon O Lord my lord if they were but a week married they would talk themselves mad Pedro County Claudio when mean you to go to church Claud Tomorrow my lord Time goes on crutches till love have all his rites Leon Not till Monday my dear son which is hence a just sevennight and a time too brief too to have all things answer my mind Pedro Come you shake the head at so long a breathing but I warrant thee Claudio the time shall not go dully by us I will in the interim undertake one of Hercules' labours which is to bring Signior Benedick and the Lady Beatrice into a mountain of affection th' one with th' other I would fain have it a match and I doubt not but to fashion it if you three will but minister such assistance as I shall give you direction Leon My lord I am for you though it cost me ten nights' watchings Claud And I my lord Pedro And you too gentle Hero Hero I will do any modest office my lord to help my cousin to a good husband Pedro And Benedick is not the unhopefullest husband that I know Thus far can I praise him he is of a noble strain of approved valour and confirm'd honesty I will teach you how to humour your cousin that she shall fall in love with Benedick and I to Leonato and Claudio with your two helps will so practise on Benedick that in despite of his quick wit and his queasy stomach he shall fall in love with Beatrice If we can do this Cupid is no longer an archer his glory shall be ours for we are the only lovegods Go in with me and I will tell you my driftSceneA hall in Leonato's houseDon John and Borachio John It is so The Count Claudio shall marry the daughter of Leonato Bora Yea my lord but I can cross it John Any bar any cross any impediment will be med'cinable to me I am sick in displeasure to him and whatsoever comes athwart his affection ranges evenly with mine How canst thou cross this marriage Bora Not honestly my lord but so covertly that no dishonesty shall appear in me John Show me briefly how Bora I think I told your lordship a year since how much I am in the favour of Margaret the waiting gentlewoman to Hero John I remember Bora I can at any unseasonable instant of the night appoint her to look out at her lady's chamber window John What life is in that to be the death of this marriage Bora The poison of that lies in you to temper Go you to the Prince your brother spare not to tell him that he hath wronged his honour in marrying the renowned Claudio whose estimation do you mightily hold up to a contaminated stale such a one as Hero John What proof shall I make of that Bora Proof enough to misuse the Prince to vex Claudio to undo Hero and kill Leonato Look you for any other issue John Only to despite them I will endeavour anything Bora Go then find me a meet hour to draw Don Pedro and the Count Claudio alone tell them that you know that Hero loves me intend a kind of zeal both to the Prince and Claudio asin love of your brother's honour who hath made this match and his friend's reputation who is thus like to be cozen'd with the semblance of a maidthat you have discover'd thus They will scarcely believe this without trial Offer them instances which shall bear no less likelihood than to see me at her chamber window hear me call Margaret Hero hear Margaret term me Claudio and bring them to see this the very night before the intended wedding for in the meantime I will so fashion the matter that Hero shall be absent and there shall appear such seeming truth of Hero's disloyalty that jealousy shall be call'd assurance and all the preparation overthrown John Grow this to what adverse issue it can I will put it in practice Be cunning in the working this and thy fee is a thousand ducats Bora Be you constant in the accusation and my cunning shall not shame me John I will presently go learn their day of marriageSceneLeonato's orchardBenedick alone Bene BoyBoy Boy Signior Bene In my chamber window lies a book Bring it hither to me in the orchard Boy I am here already sir Bene I know that but I would have thee hence and here againBoy I do much wonder that one man seeing how much another man is a fool when he dedicates his behaviours to love will after he hath laugh'd at such shallow follies in others become the argument of his own scorn by falling in love and such a man is Claudio I have known when there was no music with him but the drum and the fife and now had he rather hear the tabor and the pipe I have known when he would have walk'd ten mile afoot to see a good armour and now will he lie ten nights awake carving the fashion of a new doublet He was wont to speak plain and to the purpose like an honest man and a soldier and now is he turn'd orthography his words are a very fantastical banquet just so many strange dishes May I be so converted and see with these eyes I cannot tell I think not I will not be sworn but love may transform me to an oyster but I'll take my oath on it till he have made an oyster of me he shall never make me such a fool One woman is fair yet I am well another is wise yet I am well another virtuous yet I am well but till all graces be in one woman one woman shall not come in my grace Rich she shall be that's certain wise or I'll none virtuous or I'll never cheapen her fair or I'll never look on her mild or come not near me noble or not I for an angel of good discourse an excellent musician and her hair shall be of what colour it please God Ha the Prince and Monsieur Love I will hide me in the arbour HidesDon Pedro Leonato Claudio Music within Pedro Come shall we hear this music Claud Yea my good lord How still the evening is As hush'd on purpose to grace harmony Pedro See you where Benedick hath hid himself Claud O very well my lord The music ended We'll fit the kidfox with a pennyworth Balthasar with Music Pedro Come Balthasar we'll hear that song again Balth O good my lord tax not so bad a voice To slander music any more than once Pedro It is the witness still of excellency To put a strange face on his own perfection I pray thee sing and let me woo no more Balth Because you talk of wooing I will sing Since many a wooer doth commence his suit To her he thinks not worthy yet he wooes Yet will he swear he loves Pedro Nay pray thee come Or if thou wilt hold longer argument Do it in notes Balth Note this before my notes There's not a note of mine that's worth the noting Pedro Why these are very crotchets that he speaks Note notes forsooth and nothingMusic Bene aside Now divine air Now is his soul ravish'd Is it not strange that sheep's guts should hale souls out of men's bodies Well a horn for my money when all's done Balthasar sings The Song Sigh no more ladies sigh no more Men were deceivers ever One foot in sea and one on shore To one thing constant never Then sigh not so But let them go And be you blithe and bonny Converting all your sounds of woe Into Hey nonny nonny Sing no more ditties sing no moe Of dumps so dull and heavy The fraud of men was ever so Since summer first was leavy Then sigh not so &c Pedro By my troth a good song Balth And an ill singer my lord Pedro Ha no no faith Thou sing'st well enough for a shift Bene aside An he had been a dog that should have howl'd thus they would have hang'd him and I pray God his bad voice bode no mischief I had as live have heard the night raven come what plague could have come after it Pedro Yea marry Dost thou hear Balthasar I pray thee get us some excellent music for tomorrow night we would have it at the Lady Hero's chamber window Balth The best I can my lord Pedro Do so FarewellBalthasar with Musicians Come hither Leonato What was it you told me of today that your niece Beatrice was in love with Signior Benedick Claud O ayAside to Pedro Stalk on stalk on the fowl sits I did never think that lady would have loved any man Leon No nor I neither but most wonderful that she should so dote on Signior Benedick whom she hath in all outward behaviours seem'd ever to abhor Bene aside Is't possible Sits the wind in that corner Leon By my troth my lord I cannot tell what to think of it but that she loves him with an enraged affection It is past the infinite of thought Pedro May be she doth but counterfeit Claud Faith like enough Leon O God counterfeit There was never counterfeit of passion came so near the life of passion as she discovers it Pedro Why what effects of passion shows she Claud aside Bait the hook well This fish will bite Leon What effects my lord She will sit youyou heard my daughter tell you how Claud She did indeed Pedro How how I pray you You amaze me I would have thought her spirit had been invincible against all assaults of affection Leon I would have sworn it had my lordespecially against Benedick Bene aside I should think this a gull but that the whitebearded fellow speaks it Knavery cannot sure hide himself in such reverence Claud aside He hath ta'en th' infection Hold it up Pedro Hath she made her affection known to Benedick Leon No and swears she never will That's her torment Claud 'Tis true indeed So your daughter says hall I' says she 'that have so oft encount'red him with scorn write to him that I love him' Leon This says she now when she is beginning to write to him for she'll be up twenty times a night and there will she sit in her smock till she have writ a sheet of paper My daughter tells us all Claud Now you talk of a sheet of paper I remember a pretty jest your daughter told us of Leon O when she had writ it and was reading it over she found 'Benedick' and 'Beatrice' between the sheet Claud That Leon O she tore the letter into a thousand halfpence rail'd at herself that she should be so immodest to write to one that she knew would flout her 'I measure him' says she 'by my own spirit for I should flout him if he writ to me Yea though I love him I should' Claud Then down upon her knees she falls weeps sobs beats her heart tears her hair prays curses'O sweet Benedick God give me patience' Leon She doth indeed my daughter says so And the ecstasy hath so much overborne her that my daughter is sometime afeard she will do a desperate outrage to herself It is very true Pedro It were good that Benedick knew of it by some other if she will not discover it Claud To what end He would make but a sport of it and torment the poor lady worse Pedro An he should it were an alms to hang him She's an excellent sweet lady and out of all suspicion she is virtuous Claud And she is exceeding wise Pedro In everything but in loving Benedick Leon O my lord wisdom and blood combating in so tender a body we have ten proofs to one that blood hath the victory I am sorry for her as I have just cause being her uncle and her guardian Pedro I would she had bestowed this dotage on me I would have daff'd all other respects and made her half myself I pray you tell Benedick of it and hear what 'a will say Leon Were it good think you Claud Hero thinks surely she will die for she says she will die if he love her not and she will die ere she make her love known and she will die if he woo her rather than she will bate one breath of her accustomed crossness Pedro She doth well If she should make tender of her love 'tis very possible he'll scorn it for the man as you know all hath a contemptible spirit Claud He is a very proper man Pedro He hath indeed a good outward happiness Claud Before God and in my mind very wise Pedro He doth indeed show some sparks that are like wit Claud And I take him to be valiant Pedro As Hector I assure you and in the managing of quarrels you may say he is wise for either he avoids them with great discretion or undertakes them with a most Christianlike fear Leon If he do fear God 'a must necessarily keep peace If he break the peace he ought tointo a quarrel with fear and trembling Pedro And so will he do for the man doth fear God howsoever it seems not in him by some large jests he will make Well I am sorry for your niece Shall we go seek Benedick and tell him of her love Claud Never tell him my lord Let her wear it out with good counsel Leon Nay that's impossible she may wear her heart out first Pedro Well we will hear further of it by your daughter Let it cool the while I love Benedick well and I could wish he would modestly examine himself to see how much he is unworthy so good a lady Leon My lord will you walk Dinner is readyThey walk away Claud If he dote on her upon this I will never trust my expectation Pedro Let there be the same net spread for her and that must your daughter and her gentlewomen carry The sport will be when they hold one an opinion of another's dotage and no such matter That's the scene that I would see which will be merely a dumb show Let us send her to call him in to dinner Don Pedro Claudio and Leonato Benedick advances from the arbour Bene This can be no trick The conference was sadly borne they have the truth of this from Hero they seem to pity the lady It seems her affections have their full bent Love me Why it must be requited I hear how I am censur'd They say I will bear myself proudly if I perceive the love come from her They say too that she will rather die than give any sign of affection I did never think to marry I must not seem proud Happy are they that hear their detractions and can put them to mending They say the lady is fair'tis a truth I can bear them witness and virtuous 'tis so I cannot reprove it and wise but for loving meby my troth it is no addition to her wit nor no great argument of her folly for I will be horribly in love with her I may chance have some odd quirks and remnants of wit broken on me because I have railed so long against marriage But doth not the appetite alters A man loves the meat in his youth that he cannot endure in his age Shall quips and sentences and these paper bullets of the brain awe a man from the career of his humour No the world must be peopled When I said I would die a bachelor I did not think I should live till I were married Beatrice Here comes Beatrice By this day she's a fair lady I do spy some marks of love in her Beat Against my will I am sent to bid You come in to dinner Bene Fair Beatrice I thank you for your pains Beat I took no more pains for those thanks than you take pains to thank me If it had been painful I would not have come Bene You take pleasure then in the message Beat Yea just so much as you may take upon a knives point and choke a daw withal You have no stomach signior Fare you wellBene Ha 'Against my will I am sent to bid you come in to dinner' There's a double meaning in that 'I took no more pains for those thanks than you took pains to thank me' That's as much as to say 'Any pains that I take for you is as easy as thanks' If I do not take pity of her I am a villain if I do not love her I am a Jew I will go get her picture
