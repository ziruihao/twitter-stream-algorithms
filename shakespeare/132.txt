now sweetheart who's at home besides yourself Why none but mine own people Indeed No certainlyAside to herSpeak louder Truly I am so glad you have nobody here Why Why woman your husband is in his old lunes again He so takes on yonder with my husband so rails against all married mankind so curses an Eve's daughters of what complexion soever and so buffets himself on the forehead crying 'Peerout peerout' that any madness I ever yet beheld seem'd but tameness civility and patience to this his distemper he is in now I am glad the fat knight is not here Why does he talk of him Of none but him and swears he was carried out the last time he search'd for him in a basket protests to my husband he is now here and hath drawn him and the rest of their company from their sport to make another experiment of his suspicion But I am glad the knight is not here now he shall see his own foolery How near is he Mistress Page Hard by at street end he will be here anon I am undone the knight is here

away ere he came But what make you hereWhat shall I do I'll creep up into the chimney There they always use to discharge their birdingpieces Creep into the kilnholeWhere is it He will seek there on my

out in your own semblance you die Sir John Unless you go out disguis'd How might we disguise him Alas the day I know not There is no woman's gown big enough for him otherwise he might put on a hat a muffler and a kerchief and so escapeGood hearts devise something any extremity rather than a mischief My Maid's aunt the fat woman of Brainford has a gown above On my word it will serve him she's as big as he is and there's her thrumm'd hat and her muffler too Run up Sir John Go go sweet Sir John Mistress Page and I will look some linen for your head Quick quick we'll come dress you straight Put on the gown the while I would my husband would meet him in this shape he cannot abide the old woman of Brainford he swears she's a witch forbade her my house and hath threat'ned to beat her Heaven

that for I'll appoint my men to carry the basket again to meet him at the door with it as they did last time Nay but he'll be here presently let's go dress him like the witch of Brainford I'll first direct my men what they shall do with the basket Go up I'll bring linen for him straightHang him dishonest varlet we cannot misuse him enough We'll leave a proof by that which we will do Wives may be

our element We know nothing Come down you witch you hag you come down I say Nay good sweet husband Good gentlemen let him not strike the old womanRe in woman's clothes andCome Mother Prat come give me your handI'll prat herBeating himOut of my door you witch you hag you baggage you polecat you ronyon Out out I'll conjure you I'll fortunetell youAre you not asham'd I think you have kill'd the poor woman Nay he will do it 'Tis a goodly credit for youHang her witchBy yea and no I think the oman is a witch indeed I like not when a oman has a great peard I spy a great peard under his mufflerWill you follow gentlemen I beseech you follow see but the issue of my jealousy if I cry out thus upon no trail never trust me when I open againLet's obey his humour a little further Come gentlemen all butand Trust me he beat him most pitifully Nay by th' mass that he did not he beat him most unpitifully methought I'll have the cudgel hallow'd and hung o'er the altar it hath done meritorious service What think you May we with the warrant of womanhood and the witness of a good conscience pursue him with any further revenge The spirit of wantonness is sure scar'd out of him if the devil have him not in feesimple with fine and recovery he will never I think in the way of waste attempt us again Shall we tell our husbands how we have serv'd him Yes by all means if it be but to scrape the figures out of your husband's brains If they can find in their hearts the poor unvirtuous fat knight shall be any further afflicted we two will still be the ministers I'll warrant they'll have him publicly sham'd and methinks there would be no period to the jest should he not be publicly sham'd Come to the forge with it then shape it I would not have things coolThe Garter Innand Sir the Germans desire to have three of your horses the Duke himself will be tomorrow at court and they are going to meet himWhat duke should that be comes so secretly I hear not of him in the court Let me speak with the gentlemen they speak EnglishAy sir I'll call them to youThey shall have my horses but I'll make them pay I'll sauce them they have had my house a week at command I have turn'd away my other guests They must come off I'll sauce them Come houseand 'Tis one of the best discretions of a oman as ever did look uponAnd did he send you both these letters at an instant Within a quarter of an hourPardon me wife Henceforth do what thou wilt I rather will suspect the sun with cold Than thee with wantonness Now doth thy honour stand In him that was of late an heretic As firm as faith'Tis well 'tis well no more Be not as extreme in submission as in offence But let our plot go forward Let our wives Yet once again to make us public sport Appoint a meeting with this old fat fellow Where we may take him and disgrace him for itThere is no better way than that they spoke ofHow To send him word they'll meet him in the Park at midnight Fie fie he'll never comeYou say he has been thrown in the rivers and has been grievously peaten as an old oman methinks there should be terrors in him that he should not come methinks his flesh is punish'd he shall have no desiresSo think I too Devise but how you'll use him when he comes And let us two devise to bring him thither There is an old tale goes that Heme the Hunter Sometime a keeper here in Windsor Forest Doth all the wintertime at still midnight Walk round about an oak with great ragg'd horns And there he blasts the tree and takes the cattle And makes milchkine yield blood and shakes a chain In a most hideous and dreadful manner You have heard of such a spirit and well you know The superstitious idleheaded eld Receiv'd and did deliver to our age This tale of Heme the Hunter for a truthWhy yet there want not many that do fear In deep of night to walk by this Herne's oak But what of this Marry this is our device That Falstaff at that oak shall meet with us Disguis'd like Heme with huge horns on his headWell let it not be doubted but he'll come And in this shape When you have brought him thither What shall be done with him What is your plot That likewise have we thought upon and thus Nan Page my daughter and my little son And three or four more of their growth we'll dress Like urchins ouphes and fairies green and white With rounds of waxen tapers on their heads And rattles in their hands upon a sudden As Falstaff she and I are newly met Let them from forth a sawpit rush at once With some diffused song upon their sight We two in great amazedness will fly Then let them all encircle him about And fairylike to pinch the unclean knight And ask him why that hour of fairy revel In their so sacred paths he dares to tread In shape profane And till he tell the truth Let the supposed fairies pinch him sound And burn him with their tapers The truth being known We'll all present ourselves dishorn the spirit And mock him home to WindsorThe children must Be practis'd well to this or they'll nev'r do 'tI will teach the children their behaviours and I will be like a jackanapes also to burn the knight with my taberThat will be excellent I'll go buy them vizards My Nan shall be the Queen of all the Fairies Finely attired in a robe of whiteThat silk will I go buyAsideAnd in that time Shall Master Slender steal my Nan away And marry her at EtonGo send to Falstaff straightNay I'll to him again in name of Brook He'll tell me all his purpose Sure he'll come Fear not you that Go get us properties And tricking for our fairiesLet us about it It is admirable pleasures and fery honest knaveriesandGo Mistress Ford Send Quickly to Sir John to know his mindI'll to the Doctor he hath my good will And none but he to marry with Nan Page That Slender though well landed is an idiot And he my husband best of all affects The Doctor

beaten too If it should come to the car of the court how I have been transformed and how my transformation hath been wash'd and cudgell'd they would melt me out of my fat drop by drop and liquor fishermen's boots with me I warrant they would whip me with their fine wits till I were as crestfall'n as a dried pear I never prosper'd since I forswore myself at primero Well if my wind were but long enough to say my prayers would repent Now whence come youFrom the two parties forsoothThe devil take one party and his dam the other And so they shall be both bestowed I have suffer'd more for their sakes more than the villainous inconstancy of man's disposition is able to bearAnd have not they suffer'd Yes I warrant speciously one of them Mistress Ford good heart is beaten black and blue that you cannot see a white spot about herWhat tell'st thou me of black and blue I was beaten myself into all the colours of the rainbow and was like to be apprehended for the witch of Brainford But that my admirable dexterity of wit my counterfeiting the action of an old woman deliver'd me the knave constable had set me i' th' stocks i' th' common stocks for a witchSir let me speak with you in

I'll give the A hundred pound in gold more than your lossI will hear you Master Fenton and I will at the least keep your counselFrom time to time I have acquainted you With the dear love I bear to fair Anne Page Who mutually hath answer'd my affection So far forth as herself might be her chooser Even to my wish I have a letter from her Of such contents as you will wonder at The mirth whereof so larded with my matter That neither singly can be manifested Without the show of both Fat Falstaff Hath a great scene The image of the jest I'll show you here at large Hark good mine host Tonight at Heme's oak just 'twixt twelve and one Must my sweet Nan present the Fairy Queen The purpose why is herein which disguise While other jests are something rank on foot Her father hath commanded her to slip Away with Slender and with him at Eton Immediately to marry she hath consented Now sir Her mother even strong against that match And firm for Doctor Caius hath appointed That he shall likewise shuffle her away While other sports are tasking of their minds And at the dean'ry where a priest attends Straight marry her To this her mother's plot She seemingly obedient likewise hath Made promise to the doctor Now thus it rests Her father means she shall be all in white And in that habit when Slender sees his time To take her by the hand and bid her go She shall go with him her mother hath intended The better to denote her to the doctor For they must all be mask'd and vizarded That quaint in green she shall be loose enrob'd With ribands pendent flaring 'bout her head And when the doctor spies his vantage ripe To pinch her by the hand and on that token The maid hath given consent to go with himWhich means she to deceive father or motherBoth my good host to go along with me And here it reststhat you'll procure the vicar To stay for me at church 'twixt twelve and one And in the lawful name of marrying To give our hearts united ceremonyWell husband your device I'll to the vicar Bring you the maid you shall not lack a priestSo shall I evermore be bound to thee Besides I'll make a present recompense
