 camp at BristolandprisonersBring forth these men Bushy and Green I will not vex your souls Since presently your souls must part your bodies With too much urging your pernicious lives For 'twere no charity yet to wash your blood From off my hands here in the view of men I will unfold some causes of your deaths You have misled a prince a royal king A happy gentleman in blood and lineaments By you unhappied and disfigured clean You have in manner with your sinful hours Made a divorce betwixt his queen and him Broke the possession of a royal bed And stain'd the beauty of a fair queen's cheeks With tears drawn from her eyes by your foul wrongs Myselfa prince by fortune of my birth Near to the King in blood and near in love Till you did make him misinterpret me Have stoop'd my neck under your injuries And sigh'd my English breath in foreign clouds Eating the bitter bread of banishment Whilst you have fed upon my signories Dispark'd my parks and fell'd my forest woods From my own windows torn my household coat Raz'd out my imprese leaving me no sign Save men's opinions and my living blood To show the world I am a gentleman This and much more much more than twice all this Condemns you to the death See them delivered over To execution and the hand of deathMore welcome is the stroke of death to me Than Bolingbroke to England Lords farewellMy comfort is that heaven will take our souls And plague injustice with the pains of hellMy Lord Northumberland see them dispatch'dand others with the prisoners Uncle you say the Queen is at your house For God's sake fairly let her be entreated Tell her I send to her my kind commends Take special care my greetings be deliveredA gentleman of mine I have dispatch'd With letters of your love to her at largeThanks gentle uncle Come lords away To fight with Glendower and his complices Awhile to work and after holiday The coast of Wales A castle in view Drums Flourish and coloursthetheand soldiersBarkloughly Castle can they this at handYea my lord How brooks your Grace the air After your late tossing on the breaking seasNeeds must I like it well I weep for joy To stand upon my kingdom once again Dear earth I do salute thee with my hand Though rebels wound thee with their horses' hoofs As a longparted mother with her child Plays fondly with her tears and smiles in meeting So weepingsmiling greet I thee my earth And do thee favours with my royal hands Feed not thy sovereign's foe my gentle earth Nor with thy sweets comfort his ravenous sense But let thy spiders that suck up thy venom And heavygaited toads lie in their way Doing annoyance to the treacherous feet Which with usurping steps do trample thee Yield stinging nettles to mine enemies And when they from thy bosom pluck a flower Guard it I pray thee with a lurking adder Whose double tongue may with a mortal touch Throw death upon thy sovereign's enemies Mock not my senseless conjuration lords This earth shall have a feeling and these stones Prove armed soldiers ere her native king Shall falter under foul rebellion's armsFear not my lord that Power that made you king Hath power to keep you king in spite of all The means that heaven yields must be embrac'd And not neglected else if heaven would And we will not heaven's offer we refuse The proffered means of succour and redressHe means my lord that we are too remiss Whilst Bolingbroke through our security Grows strong and great in substance and in powerDiscomfortable cousin know'st thou not That when the searching eye of heaven is hid Behind the globe that lights the lower world Then thieves and robbers range abroad unseen In murders and in outrage boldly here But when from under this terrestrial ball He fires the proud tops of the eastern pines And darts his light through every guilty hole Then murders treasons and detested sins The cloak of night being pluck'd from off their backs Stand bare and naked trembling at themselves So when this thief this traitor Bolingbroke Who all this while hath revell'd in the night Whilst we were wand'ring with the Antipodes Shall see us rising in our throne the east His treasons will sit blushing in his face Not able to endure the sight of day But selfaffrighted tremble at his sin Not all the water in the rough rude sea Can wash the balm off from an anointed king The breath of worldly men cannot depose The deputy elected by the Lord For every man that Bolingbroke hath press'd To lift shrewd steel against our golden crown God for his Richard hath in heavenly pay A glorious angel Then if angels fight Weak men must fall for heaven still guards the rightWelcome my lord How far off lies your powerNor near nor farther off my gracious lord Than this weak arm Discomfort guides my tongue And bids me speak of nothing but despair One day too late I fear me noble lord Hath clouded all thy happy days on earth O call back yesterday bid time return And thou shalt have twelve thousand fighting men Today today unhappy day too late O'erthrows thy joys friends fortune and thy state For all the Welshmen hearing thou wert dead Are gone to Bolingbroke dispers'd and fledComfort my liege why looks your Grace so paleBut now the blood of twenty thousand men Did triumph in my face and they are fled And till so much blood thither come again Have I not reason to look pale and dead All souls that will be safe fly from my side For time hath set a blot upon my prideComfort my liege remember who you areI had forgot myself am I not King Awake thou coward majesty thou sleepest Is not the King's name twenty thousand names Arm arm my name a puny subject strikes At thy great glory Look not to the ground Ye favourites of a king are we not high High be our thoughts I know my uncle York Hath power enough to serve our turn But who comes here More health and happiness betide my liege Than can my caretun'd tongue deliver himMine ear is open and my heart prepar'd The worst is worldly loss thou canst unfold Say is my kingdom lost Why 'twas my care And what loss is it to be rid of care Strives Bolingbroke to be as great as we Greater he shall not be if he serve God We'll serve him too and be his fellow so Revolt our subjects That we cannot mend They break their faith to God as well as us Cry woe destruction ruin and decay The worst is death and death will have his dayGlad am I that your Highness is so arm'd To bear the tidings of calamity Like an unseasonable stormy day Which makes the silver rivers drown their shores As if the world were all dissolv'd to tears So high above his limits swells the rage Of Bolingbroke covering your fearful land With hard bright steel and hearts harder than steel Whitebeards have arm'd their thin and hairless scalps Against thy majesty boys with women's voices Strive to speak big and clap their female joints In stiff unwieldy arms against thy crown Thy very beadsmen learn to bend their bows Of doublefatal yew against thy state Yea distaffwomen manage rusty bills Against thy seat both young and old rebel And all goes worse than I have power to tellToo well too well thou tell'st a tale so in Where is the Earl of Wiltshire Where is Bagot What is become of Bushy Where is Green That they have let the dangerous enemy Measure our confines with such peaceful steps If we prevail their heads shall pay for it I warrant they have made peace with BolingbrokePeace have they made with him indeed my lordO villains vipers damn'd without redemption Dogs easily won to fawn on any man Snakes in my heartblood warm'd that sting my heart Three Judases each one thrice worse than Judas Would they make peace Terrible hell make war Upon their spotted souls for this offenceSweet love I see changing his property Turns to the sourest and most deadly hate Again uncurse their souls their peace is made With heads and not with hands those whom you curse Have felt the worst of death's destroying wound And lie full low grav'd in the hollow groundIs Bushy Green and the Earl of Wiltshire deadAy all of them at Bristow lost their headsWhere is the Duke my father with his powerNo matter whereof comfort no man speak Let's talk of graves of worms and epitaphs Make dust our paper and with rainy eyes Write sorrow on the bosom of the earth Let's choose executors and talk of wills And yet not sofor what can we bequeath Save our deposed bodies to the ground Our lands our lives and an are Bolingbroke's And nothing can we can our own but death And that small model of the barren earth Which serves as paste and cover to our bones For God's sake let us sit upon the ground And tell sad stories of the death of kings How some have been depos'd some slain in war Some haunted by the ghosts they have depos'd Some poison'd by their wives some sleeping kill'd All murder'dfor within the hollow crown That rounds the mortal temples of a king Keeps Death his court and there the antic sits Scoffing his state and grinning at his pomp Allowing him a breath a little scene To monarchize be fear'd and kill with looks Infusing him with self and vain conceit As if this flesh which walls about our life Were brass impregnable and humour'd thus Comes at the last and with a little pin Bores through his castle wall and farewell king Cover your heads and mock not flesh and blood With solemn reverence throw away respect Tradition form and ceremonious duty For you have but mistook me all this while I live with bread like you feel want Taste grief need friends subjected thus How can you say to me I am a kingMy lord wise men ne'er sit and wail their woes But presently prevent the ways to wail To fear the foe since fear oppresseth strength Gives in your weakness strength unto your foe And so your follies fight against yourself Fear and be slainno worse can come to fight And fight and die is death destroying death Where fearing dying pays death servile breathMy father hath a power inquire of him And learn to make a body of a limbThou chid'st me well Proud Bolingbroke I come To change blows with thee for our day of doom This ague fit of fear is overblown An easy task it is to win our own Say Scroop where lies our uncle with his power Speak sweetly man although thy looks be sourMen judge by the complexion of the sky The state in inclination of the day So may you by my dull and heavy eye My tongue hath but a heavier tale to say I play the torturer by small and small To lengthen out the worst that must be spoken Your uncle York is join'd with Bolingbroke And all your northern castles yielded up And all your southern gentlemen in arms Upon his partyThou hast said enough ToBeshrew thee cousin which didst lead me forth Of that sweet way I was in to despair What say you now What comfort have we now By heaven I'll hate him everlastingly That bids me be of comfort any more Go to Flint Castle there I'll pine away A king woe's slave shall kingly woe obey That power I have discharge and let them go To ear the land that hath some hope to grow For I have none Let no man speak again To alter this for counsel is but vainMy liege one wordHe does me double wrong That wounds me with the flatteries of his tongue Discharge my followers let them hence away From Richard's night to Bolingbroke's fair dayWales Before Flint Castlewith drum and coloursand forcesSo that by this intelligence we learn The Welshmen are dispers'd and Salisbury Is gone to meet the King who lately landed With some few private friends upon this coastThe news is very fair and good my lord Richard not far from hence hath hid his headIt would beseem the Lord Northumberland To say 'King Richard' Alack the heavy day When such a sacred king should hide his headYour Grace mistakes only to be brief Left I his title outThe time hath been Would you have been so brief with him he would Have been so brief with you to shorten you For taking so the head your whole head's lengthMistake not uncle further than you shouldTake not good cousin further than you should Lest you mistake The heavens are over our headsI know it uncle and oppose not myself Against their will But who comes here Welcome Harry What will not this castle yieldThe castle royally is mann'd my lord Against thy entranceRoyally Why it contains no kingYes my good lord It doth contain a king King Richard lies Within the limits of yon lime and stone And with him are the Lord Aumerle Lord Salisbury Sir Stephen Scroop besides a clergyman Of holy reverence who I cannot learnO belike it is the Bishop of CarlisleToNoble lord Go to the rude ribs of that ancient castle Through brazen trumpet send the breath of parley Into his ruin'd ears and thus deliver Henry Bolingbroke On both his knees doth kiss King Richard's hand And sends allegiance and true faith of heart To his most royal person hither come Even at his feet to lay my arms and power Provided that my banishment repeal'd And lands restor'd again be freely granted If not I'll use the advantage of my power And lay the summer's dust with showers of blood Rain'd from the wounds of slaughtered Englishmen The which how far off from the mind of Bolingbroke It is such crimson tempest should bedrench The fresh green lap of fair King Richard's land My stooping duty tenderly shall show Go signify as much while here we march Upon the grassy carpet of this plainadvances to the Castle with a trumpet Let's march without the noise of threat'ning drum That from this castle's tottered battlements Our fair appointments may be well perus'd Methinks King Richard and myself should meet With no less terror than the elements Of fire and water when their thund'ring shock At meeting tears the cloudy cheeks of heaven Be he the fire I'll be the yielding water The rage be his whilst on the earth I rain My waterson the earth and not on him March on and mark King Richard how he looks Parle without and answer within then a flourishon the walls thethe andSee see King Richard doth himself appear As doth the blushing discontented sun From out the fiery portal of the east When he perceives the envious clouds are bent To dim his glory and to stain the track Of his bright passage to the occidentYet he looks like a king Behold his eye As bright as is the eagle's lightens forth Controlling majesty Alack alack for woe That any harm should stain so fair a showToWe are amaz'd and thus long have we stood To watch the fearful bending of thy knee Because we thought ourself thy lawful King And if we be how dare thy joints forget To pay their awful duty to our presence If we be not show us the hand of God That hath dismiss'd us from our stewardship For well we know no hand of blood and bone Can gripe the sacred handle of our sceptre Unless he do profane steal or usurp And though you think that all as you have done Have torn their souls by turning them from us And we are barren and bereft of friends Yet knowmy master God omnipotent Is mustering in his clouds on our behalf Armies of pestilence and they shall strike Your children yet unborn and unbegot That lift your vassal hands against my head And threat the glory of my precious crown Tell Bolingbroke for yon methinks he stands That every stride he makes upon my land Is dangerous treason he is come to open The purple testament of bleeding war But ere the crown he looks for live in peace Ten thousand bloody crowns of mothers' sons Shall ill become the flower of England's face Change the complexion of her maidpale peace To scarlet indignation and bedew Her pastures' grass with faithful English bloodThe King of Heaven forbid our lord the King Should so with civil and uncivil arms Be rush'd upon Thy thrice noble cousin Harry Bolingbroke doth humbly kiss thy hand And by the honourable tomb he swears That stands upon your royal grandsire's bones And by the royalties of both your bloods Currents that spring from one most gracious head And by the buried hand of warlike Gaunt And by the worth and honour of himself Comprising all that may be sworn or said His coming hither hath no further scope Than for his lineal royalties and to beg Enfranchisement immediate on his knees Which on thy royal party granted once His glittering arms he will commend to rust His barbed steeds to stables and his heart To faithful service of your Majesty This swears he as he is a prince is just And as I am a gentleman I credit himNorthumberland say thus the King returns His noble cousin is right welcome hither And all the number of his fair demands Shall be accomplish'd without contradiction With all the gracious utterance thou hast Speak to his gentle hearing kind commends ToWe do debase ourselves cousin do we not To look so poorly and to speak so fair Shall we call back Northumberland and send Defiance to the traitor and so dieNo good my lord let's fight with gentle words Till time lend friends and friends their helpful swordsO God O God that e'er this tongue of mine That laid the sentence of dread banishment On yon proud man should take it off again With words of sooth O that I were as great As is my grief or lesser than my name Or that I could forget what I have been Or not remember what I must be now Swell'st thou proud heart I'll give thee scope to beat Since foes have scope to beat both thee and meNorthumberland comes back from BolingbrokeWhat must the King do now Must he submit The King shall do it Must he be depos'd The King shall be contented Must he lose The name of king A God's name let it go I'll give my jewels for a set of beads My gorgeous palace for a hermitage My gay apparel for an almsman's gown My figur'd goblets for a dish of wood My sceptre for a palmer's walking staff My subjects for a pair of carved saints And my large kingdom for a little grave A little little grave an obscure grave Or I'll be buried in the king's high way Some way of common trade where subjects' feet May hourly trample on their sovereign's head For on my heart they tread now whilst I live And buried once why not upon my head Aumerle thou weep'st my tenderhearted cousin We'll make foul weather with despised tears Our sighs and they shall lodge the summer corn And make a dearth in this revolting land Or shall we play the wantons with our woes And make some pretty match with shedding tears As thus to drop them still upon one place Till they have fretted us a pair of graves Within the earth and therein laidthere lies Two kinsmen digg'd their graves with weeping eyes Would not this ill do well Well well I see I talk but idly and you laugh at me Most mighty prince my Lord Northumberland What says King Bolingbroke Will his Majesty Give Richard leave to live till Richard die You make a leg and Bolingbroke says ayMy lord in the base court he doth attend To speak with you may it please you to come downDown down I come like glist'ring Phaethon Wanting the manage of unruly jades In the base court Base court where kings grow base To come at traitors' calls and do them grace In the base court Come down Down court down king For nightowls shriek where mounting larks should sing from aboveWhat says his MajestySorrow and grief of heart Makes him speak fondly like a frantic man Yet he is cometheand his attendants belowStand all apart And show fair duty to his Majesty He kneels down My gracious lordFair cousin you debase your princely knee To make the base earth proud with kissing it Me rather had my heart might feel your love Than my unpleas'd eye see your courtesy Up cousin up your heart is up I know Touching his own head Thus high at least although your knee be lowMy gracious lord I come but for mine ownYour own is yours and I am yours and allSo far be mine my most redoubted lord As my true service shall deserve your loveWell you deserve They well deserve to have That know the strong'st and surest way to get Uncle give me your hands nay dry your eyes Tears show their love but want their remedies Cousin I am too young to be your father Though you are old enough to be my heir What you will have I'll give and willing too For do we must what force will have us do Set on towards London Cousin is it soYea my good lordThen I must not say no FlourishThe's gardenthe and two What sport shall we devise here in this garden To drive away the heavy thought of careMadam we'll play at bowls'Twill make me think the world is full of rubs And that my fortune runs against the biasMadam we'll danceMy legs can keep no measure in delight When my poor heart no measure keeps in grief Therefore no dancing girl some other sportMadam we'll tell talesOf sorrow or of joyOf either madamOf neither girl For if of joy being altogether wanting It doth

sing'Tis well' that thou hast cause But thou shouldst please me better wouldst thou weepI could weep madam would it do you goodAnd I could sing would weeping do me good And never borrow any tear of thee a and twoBut stay here come the gardeners Let's step into the shadow of these trees My wretchedness unto a row of pins They will talk of state for every one doth so Against a change woe is forerun with woeand retireGo bind thou up yon dangling apricocks Which like unruly children make their sire Stoop with oppression of their prodigal weight Give some supportance to the bending twigs Go thou and Eke an executioner Cut off the heads of too fast growing sprays That look too lofty in our commonwealth All must be even in our government You thus employ'd I will go root away The noisome weeds which without profit suck The soil's fertility from wholesome flowersWhy should we in the compass of a pale Keep law and form and due proportion Showing as in a model our firm estate When our seawalled garden the whole land Is full of weeds her fairest flowers chok'd up Her fruit trees all unprun'd her hedges ruin'd Her knots disordered and her wholesome herbs Swarming with caterpillarsHold thy peace He that hath suffer'd this disorder'd spring Hath now himself met with the fall of leaf The weeds which his broadspreading leaves did shelter That seem'd in eating him to hold him up Are pluck'd up root and all by Bolingbroke I mean the Earl of Wiltshire Bushy GreenWhat are they deadThey are and Bolingbroke Hath seiz'd the wasteful King O what pity is it That he had not so trimm'd and dress'd his land As we this garden We at time of year Do wound the bark the skin of our fruit trees Lest being overproud in sap and blood With too much riches it confound itself Had he done so to great and growing men They might have Ev'd to bear and he to taste Their fruits of duty Superfluous branches We lop away that bearing boughs may live Had he done so himself had home the crown Which waste of idle hours hath quite thrown downWhat think you the King shall be deposedDepress'd he is already and depos'd 'Tis doubt he will be Letters came last night To a dear friend of the good Duke of York's That tell black tidingsO I am press'd to death through want of speaking Coming forward Thou old Adam's likeness set to dress this garden How dares thy harsh rude tongue sound this unpleasing news What Eve what serpent hath suggested the To make a second fall of cursed man Why dost thou say King Richard is depos'd Dar'st thou thou little better thing than earth Divine his downfall Say where when and how Cam'st thou by this ill tidings Speak thou wretchPardon me madam little joy have To breathe this news yet what I say is true King Richard he is in the mighty hold Of Bolingbroke Their fortunes both are weigh'd In your lord's scale is nothing but himself And some few vanities that make him light But in the balance of great Bolingbroke Besides himself are all the English peers And with that odds he weighs King Richard down Post you to London and you will find it so I speak no more than every one doth knowNimble mischance that art so light of foot Doth not thy embassage belong to me And am I last that knows it O thou thinkest To serve me last that I may longest keep Thy sorrow in my breast Come ladies go To meet at London London's King in woe What was I born to this that my sad look Should grace the triumph of great Bolingbroke Gard'ner for telling me these news of woe Pray God the plants thou graft'st may never grow Poor Queen so that thy state might be no worse I would my skill were subject to thy curse Here did she fall a tear here in this place I'll set a bank of rue sour herb of grace Rue even for ruth here shortly shall be seen In the remembrance of a weeping queen
