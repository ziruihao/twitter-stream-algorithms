verdictNo more talking on't let it be done Away awayOne word good citizensWe are accounted poor citizens the patricians good What authority surfeits on would relieve us if they would yield us but the superfluity while it were wholesome we might guess they relieved us humanely but they think we are too dear The leanness that afflicts us the object of our misery is as an inventory to particularize their abundance our sufferance is a gain to them Let us revenge this with our pikes ere we become rakes for the gods know I speak this in hunger for bread not in thirst for revengeWould you proceed especially against Caius MarciusAgainst him first he's a very dog to the commonaltyConsider you what services he has done for his countryVery well and could be content to give him good report for't but that he pays himself with being proudNay but speak not maliciouslyI say unto you what he hath done famously he did it to that end though softconscienc'd men can be content to say it was for his country he did it to please his mother and to be partly proud which he is even to the altitude of his virtueWhat he cannot help in his nature you account a vice in him You must in no way say he is covetousIf I must not I need not be barren of accusations he hath faults with surplus to tire in repetitionShouts withinWhat shouts are these The other side o' th' city is risen Why stay we prating here To th' CapitolCome comeSoft who comes here Worthy Menenius Agrippa one that hath always lov'd the peopleHe's one honest enough would all the rest were soWhat work's my countrymen in hand Where go

help Alack You are transported by calamity Thither where more attends you and you slander The helms o' th' state who care for you like fathers When you curse them as enemiesCare for us True indeed They ne'er car'd for us yet Suffer us to famish and their storehouses cramm'd with grain make edicts for usury to support usurers repeal daily any wholesome act established against the rich and provide more piercing statutes daily to chain up and restrain the poor If the wars eat us not up they will and there's all the love they bear usEither you must Confess yourselves wondrous malicious Or be accus'd of folly I shall tell you A pretty tale It may be you have heard it But since it serves my purpose I will venture To stale't a little moreWell I'll hear it sir yet you must not think to fob off our disgrace with a tale But an't please you deliverThere was a time when all the body's members Rebell'd against the belly thus accus'd it That only like a gulf it did remain I' th' midst o' th' body idle and unactive Still cupboarding the viand never bearing Like labour with the rest where th' other instruments Did see and hear devise instruct walk feel And mutually participate did minister Unto the appetite and affection common Of the whole body The belly answer'dWell sir what answer made the bellySir I shall tell you With a kind of smile Which ne'er came from the lungs but even thus For look you I may make the belly smile As well as speak it tauntingly replied To th' discontented members the mutinous parts That envied his receipt even so most fitly As you malign our senators for that They are not such as youYour belly's answer What The kingly crowned head the vigilant eye The counsellor heart the arm our soldier Our steed the leg the tongue our trumpeter With other muniments and petty helps Is this our fabric if that theyWhat then Fore me this fellow speaks What then What thenShould by the cormorant belly be restrain'd Who is the sink o' th' bodyWell what thenThe former agents if they did complain What could the belly answerI will tell you If you'll bestow a small of what you have little Patience awhile you'st hear the belly's answerY'are long about itNote me this good friend Your most grave belly was deliberate Not rash like his accusers and thus answered 'True is it my incorporate friends' quoth he 'That I receive the general food at first Which you do live upon and fit it is Because I am the storehouse and the shop Of the whole body But if you do remember I send it through the rivers of your blood Even to the court the heart to th' seat o' th' brain And through the cranks and offices of man The strongest nerves and small inferior veins From me receive that natural competency Whereby they live And though that all at once You my good friends' this says the belly mark meAy sir well well'Though all at once cannot See what I do deliver out to each Yet I can make my audit up that all From me do back receive the flour of all And leave me but the bran' What say you to' tIt was an answer How apply you thisThe senators of Rome are this good belly And you the mutinous members for examine Their counsels and their cares digest things rightly Touching the weal o' th' common you shall find No public benefit which you receive But it proceeds or comes from them to you And no way from yourselves What do you think You the great toe of this assemblyI the great toe Why the great toeFor that being one o' th' lowest basest poorest Of this most wise rebellion thou goest foremost Thou rascal that art worst in blood to run Lead'st first to win some vantage But make you ready your stiff bats and clubs Rome and her rats are at the point of battle The one side must have bale Hail noble MarciusThanks What's the matter you dissentious rogues That rubbing the poor itch of your opinion Make yourselves scabsWe have ever your good wordHe that will give good words to thee will flatter Beneath abhorring What would you have you curs That like nor peace nor war The one affrights you The other makes you proud He that trusts to you Where he should find you lions finds you hares Where foxes geese you are no surer no Than is the coal of fire upon the ice Or hailstone in the sun Your virtue is To make him worthy whose offence subdues him And curse that justice did it Who deserves greatness Deserves your hate and your affections are A sick man's appetite who desires most that Which would increase his evil He that depends Upon your favours swims with fins of lead And hews down oaks with rushes Hang ye Trust ye With every minute you do change a mind And call him noble that was now your hate Him vile that was your garland What's the matter That in these several places of the city You cry against the noble Senate who Under the gods keep you in awe which else Would feed on one another What's their seekingFor corn at their own rates whereof they say The city is well stor'dHang 'em They say They'll sit by th' fire and presume to know What's done i' th' Capitol who's like to rise Who thrives and who declines side factions and give out Conjectural marriages making parties strong And feebling such as stand not in their liking Below their cobbled shoes They say there's grain enough Would the nobility lay aside their ruth And let me use my sword I'd make a quarry With thousands of these quarter'd slaves as high As I could pick my lanceNay these are almost thoroughly persuaded For though abundantly they lack discretion Yet are they passing cowardly But I beseech you What says the other troopThey are dissolv'd Hang 'em They said they were anhungry sigh'd forth proverbs That hunger broke stone walls that dogs must eat That meat was made for mouths that the gods sent not Corn for the rich men only With these shreds They vented their complainings which being answer'd And a petition granted them a strange one To break the heart of generosity And make bold power look pale they threw their caps As they would hang them on the horns o' th' moon Shouting their emulationWhat is granted themFive tribunes to defend their vulgar wisdoms Of their own choice One's Junius Brutus Sicinius Velutus and I know not death The rabble should have first unroof'd the city Ere so prevail'd with me it will in time Win upon power and throw forth greater themes For insurrection's arguingThis is strangeGo get you home you fragments ahastilyWhere's Caius MarciusHere What's the matterThe news is sir the Volsces are in armsI am glad on't then we shall ha' means to vent Our musty superfluity See our best elders with otherand Marcius 'tis true that you have lately told us The Volsces are in armsThey have a leader Tullus Aufidius that will put you to't I sin in envying his nobility And were I anything but what I am I would wish me only heYou have fought togetherWere half to half the world by th' ears and he Upon my party I'd revolt to make Only my wars with him He is a lion That I am proud to huntThen worthy Marcius Attend upon Cominius to these warsIt is your former promiseSir it is And I am constant Titus Lartius thou Shalt see me once more strike at Tullus' face What art thou stiff Stand'st outNo Caius Marcius I'll lean upon one

tauntsBeing mov'd he will not spare to gird the godsBemock the modest moonThe present wars devour him He is grown Too proud to be so valiantSuch a nature Tickled with good success disdains the shadow Which he treads on at noon But I do wonder His insolence can brook to be commanded Under CominiusFame at the which he aims In whom already he is well grac'd cannot Better be held nor more attain'd than by A place below the first for what miscarries Shall be the general's fault though he perform To th' utmost of a man and giddy censure Will then cry out of Marcius 'O if he Had borne the business'Besides if things go well Opinion that so sticks on Marcius shall Of his demerits rob CominiusCome Half all Cominius' honours are to Marcius Though Marcius earn'd them not and all his faults

houseandmother and wife tothey set them down on two low stools and sewI pray you daughter sing or express yourself in a more comfortable sort If my son were my husband I should freelier rejoice in

gaze his way when for a day of kings' entreaties a mother should not sell him an hour from her beholding I considering how honour would become such a person that it was no better than picturelike to
