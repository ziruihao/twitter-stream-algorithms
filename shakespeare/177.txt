this roar allay them The sky it seems would pour down stinking pitch But that the sea mounting to th' welkin's cheek Dashes the fire out O I have suffered With those that I saw suffer A brave vessel Who had no doubt some noble creature in her Dash'd all to pieces O the cry did knock Against my very heart Poor souls they perish'd Had I been any god of power I would Have sunk the sea within the earth or ere It should the good ship so have swallow'd and The fraughting souls within herBe conected No more amazement tell your piteous heart There's no harm doneO woe the dayNo harm I have done nothing but in care of thee Of thee my dear one thee my daughter who Art ignorant of what thou art nought knowing Of whence I am nor that I am more better Than Prospero master of a full poor cell And thy no greater fatherMore to know Did never meddle with my thoughts'Tis time I should inform thee farther Lend thy hand And pluck my magic garment from me So Lays down his mantle Lie there my art Wipe thou thine eyes have comfort The direful spectacle of the wreck which touch'd The very virtue of compassion in thee I have with such provision in mine art So safely ordered that there is no soul No not so much perdition as an hair Betid to any creature in the vessel Which thou heard'st cry which thou saw'st sink Sit down for thou must now know fartherYou have often Begun to tell me what I am but stopp'd And left me to a bootless inquisition Concluding tay not yet'The hour's now come The very minute bids thee ope thine ear Obey and be attentive Canst thou remember A time before we came unto this cell I do not think thou canst for then thou wast not Out three years oldCertainly sir I canBy what By any other house or person Of any thing the image tell me that Hath kept with thy remembrance'Tis far off And rather like a dream than an assurance That my remembrance warrants Had I not Four or five women once that tended meThou hadst and more Miranda But how is it That this lives in thy mind What seest thou else In the dark backward and abysm of time If thou rememb'rest aught ere thou cam'st here How thou cam'st here thou maystBut that I do notTwelve year since Miranda twelve year since Thy father was the Duke of Milan and A prince of powerSir are not you my fatherThy mother was a piece of virtue and She said thou wast my daughter and thy father Was Duke of Milan and his only heir And princess no worse issuedO the heavens What foul play had we that we came from thence Or blessed was't we didBoth both my girl By foul play as thou say'st were we heav'd thence But blessedly holp hitherO my heart bleeds To think o' th' teen that I have turn'd you to Which is from my remembrance Please you fartherMy brother and thy uncle call'd Antonio I pray thee mark me that a brother should Be so perfidious He whom next thyself Of all the world I lov'd and to him put The manage of my state as at that time Through all the signories it was the first And Prospero the prime duke being so reputed In dignity and for the liberal arts Without a parallel those being all my study The government I cast upon my brother And to my state grew stranger being transported And rapt in secret studies Thy false uncle Dost thou attend meSir most heedfullyBeing once perfected how to grant suits How to deny them who t' advance and who To trash for overtopping new created The creatures that were mine I say or chang'd 'em Or else new form'd 'em having both the key Of officer and office set all hearts i' th' state To what tune pleas'd his ear that now he was The ivy which had hid my princely trunk And suck'd my verdure out on't Thou attend'st notO good sir I doI pray thee mark me I thus neglecting worldly ends all dedicated To closeness and the bettering of my mind With that which but by being so retir'd O'erpriz'd all popular rate in my false brother Awak'd an evil nature and my trust Like a good parent did beget of him A falsehood in its contrary as great As my trust was which had indeed no limit A confidence sans bound He being thus lorded Not only with what my revenue yielded But what my power might else exact like one Who having into truth by telling of it Made such a sinner of his memory To credit his own liehe did believe He was indeed the Duke out o' th' substitution And executing th' outward face of royalty With all prerogative Hence his ambition growing Dost thou hearYour tale sir would cure deafnessTo have no screen between this part he play'd And him he play'd it for he needs will be Absolute Milan Me poor manmy library Was dukedom large enoughof temporal royalties He thinks me now incapable confederates So dry he was for sway wi' th' King of Naples To give him annual tribute do him homage Subject his coronet to his crown and bend The dukedom yet unbow'dalas poor Milan To most ignoble stoopingO the heavensMark his condition and th' event then tell me If this might be a brotherI should sin To think but nobly of my grandmother Good wombs have borne bad sonsNow the condition This King of Naples being an enemy To me inveterate hearkens my brother's suit Which was that he in lieu o' th' premises Of homage and I know not how much tribute Should presently extirpate me and mine Out of the dukedom and confer fair Milan With all the honours on my brother Whereon A treacherous army levied one midnight Fated to th' purpose did Antonio open The gates of Milan and i' th' dead of darkness The ministers for th' purpose hurried thence Me and thy crying selfAlack for pity I not rememb'ring how I cried out then Will cry it o'er again it is a hint That wrings mine eyes to'tHear a little further And then I'll bring thee to the present busines Which now's upon 's without the which this story Were most impertinentWherefore did they not That hour destroy usWell demanded wench My tale provokes that question Dear they durst not So dear the love my people bore me nor set A mark so bloody on the business but With colours fairer painted their foul ends In few they hurried us aboard a bark Bore us some leagues to sea where they prepared A rotten carcass of a butt not rigg'd Nor tackle sail nor mast the very rats Instinctively have quit it There they hoist us To cry to th' sea that roar'd to us to sigh To th' winds whose pity sighing back again Did us but loving wrongAlack what trouble Was I then to youO a cherubin Thou wast that did preserve me Thou didst smile Infused with a fortitude from heaven When I have deck'd the sea with drops full salt Under my burden groan'd which rais'd in me An undergoing stomach to bear up Against what should ensueHow came we ashoreBy Providence divine Some food we had and some fresh water that A noble Neapolitan Gonzalo Out of his charity who being then appointed Master of this design did give us with Rich garments linens stuffs and necessaries Which since have steaded much so of his gentleness Knowing I lov'd my books he furnish'd me From mine own library with volumes that I prize above my dukedomWould I might But ever see that manNow I arisePuts on his mantle Sit still and hear the last of our seasorrow Here in this island we arriv'd and here Have I thy schoolmaster made thee more profit Than other princess' can that have more time For vainer hours and tutors not so carefulHeavens thank you for't And now I pray you sir For still 'tis beating in my mind your reason For raising this seastormKnow thus far forth By accident most strange bountiful Fortune Now my dear lady hath mine enemies Brought to this shore and by my prescience I find my zenith doth depend upon A most auspicious star whose influence If now I court not but omit my fortunes Will ever after droop Here cease more questions Thou art inclin'd to sleep 'tis a good dullness And give it way I know thou canst not choose sleeps Come away servant come I am ready now Approach my Ariel ComeAll hail great master grave sir hail I come To answer thy best pleasure be't to fly To swim to dive into the fire to ride On the curl'd clouds To thy strong bidding task Ariel and all his qualityHast thou spirit Perform'd to point the tempest that I bade theeTo every article I boarded the King's ship now on the beak Now in the waist the deck in every cabin I flam'd amazement Sometime I'd divide And burn in many places on the topmast The yards and bowsprit would I flame distinctly Then meet and join Jove's lightning the precursors O' th' dreadful thunderclaps more momentary And sightoutrunning were not the fire and cracks Of sulphurous roaring the most mighty Neptune Seem to besiege and make his bold waves tremble Yea his dread trident shakeMy brave spirit Who was so firm so constant that this coil Would not infect his reasonNot a soul But felt a fever of the mad and play'd Some tricks of desperation All but mariners Plung'd in the foaming brine and quit the vessel Then all afire with me the King's son Ferdinand With hair upstaringthen like reeds not hair Was the first man that leapt cried 'Hell is empty And all the devils are here'Why that's my spirit But was not this nigh shoreClose by my masterBut are they Ariel safeNot a hair perish'd On their sustaining garments not a blemish But fresher than before and as thou bad'st me In troops I have dispers'd them 'bout the isle The King's son have I landed by himself Whom I left cooling of the air with sighs In an odd angle of the isle and sitting His arms in this sad knotOf the King's ship The mariners say how thou hast dispos'd And all the rest o' th' fleetSafely in harbour Is the King's ship in the deep nook where once Thou call'dst me up at midnight to fetch dew From the stillvex'd Bermoothes there she's hid The mariners all under hatches stowed Who with a charm join'd to their suff'red labour I have left asleep and for the rest o' th' fleet Which I dispers'd they all have met again And are upon the Mediterranean flote Bound sadly home for Naples Supposing that they saw the King's ship wreck'd And his great person perishAriel thy charge Exactly is perform'd but there's more work What is the time o' th' dayPast the mid seasonAt least two glasses The time 'twixt six and now Must by us both be spent most

potent ministers And in her most unmitigable rage Into a cloven pine within which rift Imprison'd thou didst painfully remain A dozen years within which space she died And left thee there where thou
