A house in Rome Antony Octavius and Lepidus seated at a tableThese many then shall die their names are prick'dYour brother too must die consent you LepidusI do consentPrick him down AntonyUpon condition Publius shall not live Who is your sister's son Mark AntonyHe shall not live look with a spot I damn him But Lepidus go you to Caesar's house Fetch the will hither and we shall determine How to cut off some charge in legaciesWhat shall I find you hereOr here or at the Capitol LepidusThis is a slight unmeritable man Meet to be sent on errands Is it fit The threefold world divided he should stand One of the three to share itSo you thought him And took his voice who should be prick'd to die In our black sentence and proscriptionOctavius I have seen more days than you And though we lay these honors on this man To ease ourselves of divers slanderous loads He shall but bear them as the ass bears gold To groan and sweat under the business Either led or driven as we point the way And having brought our treasure where we will Then take we down his load and turn him off Like to the empty ass to shake his ears And graze in commonsYou may do your will But he's a tried and valiant soldierSo is my horse Octavius and for that I do appoint him store of provender It is a creature that I teach to fight To wind to stop to run directly on His corporal motion govern'd by my spirit And in some taste is Lepidus but so He must be taught and train'd and bid go forth A barrenspirited fellow one that feeds On objects arts and imitations Which out of use and staled by other men Begin his fashion Do not talk of him But as a property And now Octavius Listen great things Brutus and Cassius Are levying powers we must straight make head Therefore let our alliance be combined Our best friends made our means stretch'd And let us presently go sit in council How covert matters may be best disclosed And open perils surest answeredLet us do so for we are at the stake And bay'd about with many enemies And some that smile have in their hearts I fear Millions of mischiefs Camp near Sardis Before Brutus' tent DrumBrutus Lucilius Lucius and Soldiers Titinius and Pindarus meet themStand hoGive the word ho and standWhat now Lucilius is Cassius nearHe is at hand and Pindarus is come To do you salutation from his masterHe greets me well Your master Pindarus In his own change or by ill officers Hath given me some worthy cause to wish Things done undone but if he be at hand I shall be satisfiedI do not doubt But that my noble master will appear Such as he is full of regard and honorHe is not doubted A word Lucilius How he received you Let me be resolvedWith courtesy and with respect enough But not with such familiar instances Nor with such free and friendly conference As he hath used of oldThou hast described A hot friend cooling Ever note Lucilius When love begins to sicken and decay It useth an enforced ceremony There are no tricks in plain and simple faith But hollow men like horses hot at hand Make gallant show and promise of their mettle But when they should endure the bloody spur They fall their crests and like deceitful jades Sink in the trial Comes his army onThey meant his night in Sard is to be quarter'd The greater part the horse in general Are come with Cassius Low march withinHark he is arrived March gently on to meet himCassius and his PowersStand hoStand ho Speak the word alongStandStandStandMost noble brother you have done me wrongJudge me you gods Wrong I mine enemies And if not so how should I wrong a brotherBrutus this sober form of yours hides wrongs And when you do themCassius be content Speak your griefs softly I do know you well Before the eyes of both our armies here Which should perceive nothing but love from us Let us not wrangle Bid them move away Then in my tent Cassius enlarge your griefs And I will give you audiencePindarus Bid our commanders lead their charges off A little from this groundLucilius do you the like and let no man Come to our tent till we have done our conference Let Lucius and Titinius guard our door Brutus' tentBrutus and CassiusThat you have wrong'd me doth appear in this You have condemn'd and noted Lucius Pella For taking bribes here of the Sardians Wherein my letters praying on his side Because I knew the man were slighted offYou wrong'd yourself to write in such a caseIn such a time as this it is not meet That every nice offense should bear his commentLet me tell you Cassius you yourself Are much condemn'd to have an itching palm To sell and mart your offices for gold To undeserversI an itching palm You know that you are Brutus that speaks this Or by the gods this speech were else your lastThe name of Cassius honors this corruption And chastisement doth therefore hide his headChastisementRemember March the ides of March remember Did not great Julius bleed for justice' sake What villain touch'd his body that did stab And not for justice What shall one of us That struck the foremost man of all this world But for supporting robbers shall we now Contaminate our fingers with base bribes And sell the mighty space of our large honors For so much trash as may be grasped thus I had rather be a dog and bay the moon Than such a RomanBrutus bait not me I'll not endure it You forget yourself To hedge me in I am a soldier I Older in practice abler than yourself To make conditionsGo to you are not CassiusI amI say you are notUrge me no more I shall forget myself Have mind upon your health tempt me no fartherAway slight manIs't possibleHear me for I will speak Must I give way and room to your rash choler Shall I be frighted when a madman staresO gods ye gods Must I endure all thisAll this Ay more Fret till your proud heart break Go show your slaves how choleric you are And make your bondmen tremble Must I bouge Must I observe you Must I stand and crouch Under your testy humor By the gods You shall digest the venom of your spleen Though it do split you for from this day forth I'll use you for my mirth yea for my laughter When you are waspishIs it come to thisYou say you are a better soldier Let it appear so make your vaunting true And it shall please me well For mine own part I shall be glad to learn of noble menYou wrong me every way you wrong me Brutus I said an elder soldier not a better Did I say betterIf you did I care notWhen Caesar lived he durst not thus have moved mePeace peace You durst not so have tempted himI durst notNoWhat durst not tempt himFor your life you durst notDo not presume too much upon my love I may do that I shall be sorry forYou have done that you should be sorry for There is no terror Cassius in your threats For I am arm'd so strong in honesty That they pass by me as the idle wind Which I respect not I did send to you For certain sums of gold which you denied me For I can raise no money by vile means By heaven I had rather coin my heart And drop my blood for drachmas than to wring From the hard hands of peasants their vile trash By any indirection I did send To you for gold to pay my legions Which you denied me Was that done like Cassius Should I have answer'd Caius Cassius so When Marcus Brutus grows so covetous To lock such rascal counters from his friends Be ready gods with all your thunderbolts Dash him to piecesI denied you notYou didI did not He was but a fool That brought my answer back Brutus hath rived my heart A friend should bear his friend's infirmities But Brutus makes mine greater than they areI do not till you practise them on meYou love me notI do not like your faultsA friendly eye could never see such faultsA flatterer's would not though they do appear As huge as high OlympusCome Antony and young Octavius come Revenge yourselves alone on Cassius For Cassius is aweary of the world Hated by one he loves braved by his brother Check'd like a bondman all his faults observed Set in a notebook learn'd and conn'd by rote To cast into my teeth O I could weep My spirit from mine eyes There is my dagger And here my naked breast within a heart Dearer than Pluto's mine richer than gold If that thou best a Roman take it forth I that denied thee gold will give my heart Strike as thou didst at Caesar for I know When thou didst hate him worst thou lovedst him better Than ever thou lovedst CassiusSheathe your dagger Be angry when you will it shall have scope Do what you will dishonor shall be humor O Cassius you are yoked with a lamb That carries anger as the flint bears fire Who much enforced shows a hasty spark And straight is cold againHath Cassius lived To be but mirth and laughter to his Brutus When grief and blood illtemper'd vexeth himWhen I spoke that I was illtemper'd tooDo you confess so much Give me your handAnd my heart tooO BrutusWhat's the matterHave not you love enough to bear with me When that rash humor which my mother gave me Makes me forgetfulYes Cassius and from henceforth When you are overearnest with your Brutus He'll think your mother chides and leave you soWithin Let me go in to see the generals There is some grudge between 'em 'tis not meet They be aloneWithin You shall not come to themWithin Nothing but death shall stay mePoet followed by Lucilius Titinius and LuciusHow now what's the matterFor shame you generals What do you mean Love and be friends as two such men should be For I have seen more years I'm sure than yeHa ha How vilely doth this cynic rhymeGet you hence sirrah saucy fellow henceBear with him Brutus 'tis his fashionI'll know his humor when he knows his time What should the wars do with these jigging fools Companion henceAway away be gonePoetLucilius and Titinius bid the commanders Prepare to lodge their companies tonightAnd come yourselves and bring Messala with you Immediately to usLucilius and TitiniusLucius a bowl of wineLuciusI did not think you could have been so angryO Cassius I am sick of many griefsOf your philosophy you make no use If you give place to accidental evilsNo man bears sorrow better Portia is deadHa PortiaShe is deadHow 'scaped killing when I cross'd you so O insupportable and touching loss Upon what sicknessImpatient of my absence And grief that young Octavius with Mark Antony Have made themselves so strong for with her death That tidings came with this she fell distract And her attendants absent swallow'd fireAnd died soEven soO ye immortal godsRe Lucius with wine and taperSpeak no more of her Give me a bowl of wine In this I bury all unkindness CassiusDrinksMy heart is thirsty for that noble pledge Fill Lucius till the wine o'erswell

necessitiesPortia art thou goneNo more I pray you Messala I have here received letters That young Octavius and Mark Antony Come down upon us with a mighty power Bending their expedition toward PhilippiMyself have letters of the selfsame tenureWith what additionThat by proscription and bills of outlawry Octavius Antony and Lepidus Have put to death an hundred senatorsThere in our letters do not well agree Mine speak of seventy senators that died By their proscriptions Cicero being oneCicero oneCicero is dead And by that order of proscription Had you your letters from your wife my lordNo MessalaNor nothing in your letters writ of herNothing MessalaThat methinks is strangeWhy ask you Hear you aught of her in yoursNo my lordNow as you are a Roman tell me trueThen like a Roman bear the truth I tell For certain she is dead and by strange mannerWhy farewell Portia We must die Messala With meditating that she must die once I have the patience to endure it nowEven so great men great losses should endureI have as much of this in art as you But yet my nature could not bear it soWell to our work alive What do you think Of marching to Philippi presentlyI do not think it goodYour reasonThis it is 'Tis better that the enemy seek us So shall he waste his means weary his soldiers Doing himself offense whilst we lying still Are full of rest defense and nimblenessGood reasons must of force give place to better The people 'twixt Philippi and this ground Do stand but in a forced affection For they have grudged us contribution The enemy marching along by them By them shall make a fuller number up Come on refresh'd newadded and encouraged From which advantage shall we cut him off If at Philippi we do face him there These people at our backHear me good brotherUnder your pardon You must note beside That we have tried the utmost of our friends Our legions are brimfull our cause is ripe The enemy increaseth every day We at the height are ready to decline There is a tide in the affairs of men Which taken at the flood leads on to fortune Omitted all the voyage of their life Is bound in shallows and in miseries On such a full sea are we now afloat And we must take the current when it serves Or lose our venturesThen with your will go on We'll along ourselves and meet them at PhilippiThe deep of night is crept upon our talk And nature must obey necessity Which we will niggard with a little rest There is no more to sayNo more Good night Early tomorrow will we rise and henceLuciusRe Lucius My gown Lucius Farewell good Messala Good night Titinius noble noble Cassius
