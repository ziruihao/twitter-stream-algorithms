Milan An abbeyThe sun begins to gild the western sky And now it is about the very hour That Silvia at Friar Patrick's cell should meet me She will not fail for lovers break not hours Unless it be to come before their time So much they spur their expeditionSee where she comes Lady a happy eveningAmen amen Go on good Eglamour Out at the postern by the abbey wall I fear I am attended by some spiesFear not The forest is not three leagues off If we recover that we are sure enough Milan Thepalaceand as Sir Proteus what says Silvia to my suitO sir I find her milder than she was And yet she takes exceptions at your personWhat that my leg is too longNo that it is too littleI'll wear a boot to make it somewhat rounder AsideBut love will not be spurr'd to what it loathesWhat says she to my faceShe says it is a fair oneNay then the wanton lies my face is blackBut pearls are fair and the old saying is Black men are pearls in beauteous ladies' eyes Aside'Tis true such pearls as put out ladies' eyes For I had rather wink than look on themHow likes she my discourseIll when you talk of warBut well when I discourse of love and peace AsideBut better indeed when you hold your peaceWhat says she to my valourO sir she makes no doubt of that AsideShe needs not when she knows it cowardiceWhat says she to my birthThat you are well deriv'd AsideTrue from a gentleman to a foolConsiders she my possessionsO ay and pities themWherefore AsideThat such an ass should owe themThat they are out by leaseHere comes the DukeHow now Sir Proteus how now Thurio Which of you saw Sir Eglamour of lateNot Nor Saw you my daughterNeitherWhy then She's fled unto that peasant Valentine And Eglamour is in her company 'Tis true for Friar Lawrence met them both As he in penance wander'd through the forest Him he knew well and guess'd that it was she But being mask'd he was not sure of it Besides she did intend confession At Patrick's cell this even and there she was not These likelihoods confirm her flight from hence Therefore I pray you stand not to discourse But mount you presently and meet with me Upon the rising of the mountain foot That leads toward Mantua whither they are fled Dispatch sweet gentlemen and follow me Why this it is to be a peevish girl That flies her fortune when it follows her I'll after more to be reveng'd on Eglamour Than for the love of reckless Silvia And I will follow more for Silvia's love Than hate of Eglamour that goes with herAnd I will follow more to cross that love Than hate for Silvia that is gone for loveThe frontiers of Mantua The forestwith Come come Be patient we must bring you to our captainA thousand more mischances than this one Have learn'd me how to brook this patientlyCome bring her awayWhere is the gentleman that was with herBeing nimblefooted he hath outrun us But Moyses and Valerius follow him Go thou with her to the west end of the wood There is our captain we'll follow him that's fled The thicket is beset he cannot 'scapeCome I must bring you to our captain's cave Fear not he bears an honourable mind And will not use a woman lawlesslyO Valentine this I endure for theeAnother part of the forestHow use doth breed a habit in a man This shadowy desert unfrequented woods I better brook than flourishing peopled towns Here can I sit alone unseen of any And to the nightingale's complaining notes Tune my distresses and record my woes O thou that dost inhabit in my breast Leave not the mansion so long tenantless Lest growing ruinous the building fall And leave no memory of what it was Repair me with thy presence Silvia Thou gentle nymph cherish thy forlorn swain What halloing and what stir is this today These are my mates that make their wills their law Have some unhappy passenger in chase They love me well yet I have much to do To keep them from uncivil outrages Withdraw thee Valentine Who's this comes hereSteps asideand as SebastianMadam this service I have done for you Though you respect not aught your servant doth To hazard life and rescue you from him That would have forc'd your honour and your love Vouchsafe me for my meed but one fair look A smaller boon than this I cannot beg And less than this I am sure you cannot give AsideHow like a dream is this I see and hear Love lend me patience to forbear awhileO miserable unhappy that I amUnhappy were you madam ere I came But by my coming I have made you happyBy thy approach thou mak'st me most unhappy AsideAnd me when he approacheth to your presenceHad I been seized by a hungry lion I would have been a breakfast to the beast Rather than have false Proteus rescue me O heaven be judge how I love Valentine Whose life's as tender to me as my soul And full as much for more there cannot be I do detest false perjur'd Proteus Therefore be gone solicit me no moreWhat dangerous action stood it next to death Would I not undergo for one calm look O 'tis the curse in love and still approv'd When women cannot love where they're belov'dWhen Proteus cannot love where he's belov'd Read over Julia's heart thy first best love For whose dear sake thou didst then rend thy faith Into a thousand oaths and all those oaths Descended into perjury to love me Thou hast no faith left now unless thou'dst two And that's far worse than none better have none Than plural faith which is too much by one Thou counterfeit to thy true friendIn love Who respects friendAll men but ProteusNay if the gentle spirit of moving words Can no way change you to a milder form I'll woo you like a soldier at arms' end And love you 'gainst the nature of love force yeO heavenI'll force thee yield to my desireRuffian let go that rude uncivil touch Thou friend of an ill fashionValentineThou common friend that's without faith or love For such is a friend now treacherous man Thou hast beguil'd my hopes nought but mine eye Could have persuaded me Now I dare not say I have one friend alive thou wouldst disprove me Who should be trusted when one's own right hand Is perjured to the bosom Proteus I am sorry I must never trust thee more But count the world a stranger for thy sake The private wound is deepest O time most accurst 'Mongst all foes that a friend should be the worstMy shame and guilt confounds me Forgive me Valentine if hearty sorrow Be a sufficient ransom for offence I tender 't here I do as truly suffer As e'er I did commitThen I am paid And once again I do receive thee honest Who by repentance is not satisfied Is nor of heaven nor earth for these are pleas'd By penitence th' Eternal's wrath's appeas'd And that my love may appear plain and free All that was mine in Silvia I give theeO me unhappySwoonsLook to the boyWhy boy why wag how now What's the matter Look up speakO good sir my master charg'd me to deliver a ring to Madam Silvia which out of my neglect was never doneWhere is that ring boyHere 'tis this is itHow let me see Why this is the ring I gave to JuliaO cry you mercy sir I have mistook This is the ring you sent to SilviaBut how cam'st thou by this ring At my depart I gave this unto JuliaAnd Julia herself did give it me And Julia herself have brought it hitherHow JuliaBehold her that gave aim to all thy oaths And tain'd 'em deeply in her heart How oft hast thou with perjury cleft the root O Proteus let this habit make thee blush Be thou asham'd that I have took upon me Such an immodest raiment if shame live In a disguise of love It is the lesser blot modesty finds Women to change their shapes than men their mindsThan men their minds 'tis true O heaven were man But constant he were perfect That one error Fills him with faults makes him run through all th' sins Inconstancy falls off ere it begins What is in Silvia's face but I may spy More fresh in Julia's with a constant eyeCome come a hand from either Let me be blest to make this happy close 'Twere pity two such friends should be long foesBear witness heaven I have my wish for everAnd I mine with and A prize a prize a prizeForbear forbear I say it is my lord the Duke Your Grace is welcome to a man disgrac'd Banished ValentineSir ValentineYonder is Silvia and Silvia's mineThurio give back or else embrace thy death Come not within the measure of my wrath Do not name Silvia thine if once again Verona shall not hold thee Here she stands Take but possession of her with a touch I dare thee but to breathe upon my loveSir Valentine I care not for her I I hold him but a fool that will endanger His body for a girl that loves him not I claim her not and therefore she is thineThe more degenerate and base art thou To make such means for her as thou hast done And leave her on such slight conditions Now by the honour of my ancestry I do applaud thy spirit Valentine And think thee worthy of an empress' love Know then I here forget all former griefs Cancel all grudge repeal thee home again Plead a new state in thy unrivall'd merit To which I thus subscribe Sir Valentine Thou art a gentleman and well deriv'd Take thou thy Silvia for thou hast deserv'd herI thank your Grace the gift hath made me happy I now beseech you for your daughter's sake To grant one boon that I shall ask of youI grant it for thine own whate'er it beThese banish'd men that I have kept withal Are men endu'd with worthy qualities Forgive them what they have committed here And let them be recall'd from their exile They are reformed civil full of good And fit for great employment worthy lordThou hast prevail'd I pardon them and thee Dispose of them as thou know'st their deserts Come let us go we will include all jars With triumphs mirth and rare solemnityAnd as we walk along I dare be bold With our discourse to make your Grace to smile What think you of this page my lordI think the boy hath grace in him he blushesI warrant you my lord more grace than boyWhat mean you by that sayingPlease you I'll tell you as we pass along That you will wonder what hath fortuned Come Proteus 'tis your penance but to hear The story of your loves discovered That done our day of marriage shall be yours One feast one house one mutual happiness
