London The palacetheat one door at the other theand the Good morrow and well met How have ye done Since last we saw in FranceI thank your Grace Healthful and ever since a fresh admirer Of what I saw thereAn untimely ague Stay'd me a prisoner in my chamber when Those suns of glory those two lights of men Met in the vale of Andren'Twixt Guynes and Arde I was then present saw them salute on horseback Beheld them when they lighted how they clung In their embracement as they grew together Which had they what four thron'd ones could have weigh'd Such a compounded oneAll the whole time I was my chamber's prisonerThen you lost The view of earthly glory men might say Till this time pomp was single but now married To one above itself Each following day Became the next day's master till the last Made former wonders its Today the French All clinquant all in gold like heathen gods Shone down the English and tomorrow they Made Britain India every man that stood Show'd like a mine Their dwarfish pages were As cherubins an gilt the madams too Not us'd to toil did almost sweat to bear The pride upon them that their very labour Was to them as a painting Now this masque Was cried incomparable and th' ensuing night Made it a fool and beggar The two kings Equal in lustre were now best now worst As presence did present them him in eye still him in praise and being present both 'Twas said they saw but one and no discerner Durst wag his tongue in censure When these suns For so they phrase 'emby their heralds challeng'd The noble spirits to arms they did perform Beyond thought's compass that former fabulous story Being now seen possible enough got credit That Bevis was believ'dO you go farAs I belong to worship and affect In honour honesty the tract of ev'rything Would by a good discourser lose some life Which action's self was tongue to All was royal To the disposing of it nought rebell'd Order gave each thing view The office did Distinctly his full functionWho did guide I mean who set the body and the limbs Of this great sport together as you guessOne certes that promises no element In such a businessI pray you who my lordAll this was ord'red by the good discretion Of the right reverend Cardinal of YorkThe devil speed him No man's pie is freed From his ambitious finger What had he To do in these fierce vanities I wonder That such a keech can with his very bulk Take up the rays o' th' beneficial sun And keep it from the earthSurely sir There's in him stuff that puts him to these ends For being not propp'd by ancestry whose grace Chalks successors their way nor call'd upon For high feats done to th' crown neither allied To eminent assistants but spiderlike Out of his selfdrawing web 'a gives us note The force of his own merit makes his way A gift that heaven gives for him which buys A place next to the KingI cannot tell What heaven hath given himlet some graver eye Pierce into that but I can see his pride Peep through each part of him Whence has he that If not from hell the devil is a niggard Or has given all before and he begins A new hell in himselfWhy the devil Upon this French going out took he upon him Without the privity o' th' Kingt' appoint Who should attend on him He makes up the file Of all the gentry for the most part such To whom as great a charge as little honour He meant to lay upon and his own letter The honourable board of council out Must fetch him in he papersI do know Kinsmen of mine three at the least that have By this so sicken'd their estates that never They shall abound as formerlyO many Have broke their backs with laying manors on 'em For this great journey What did this vanity But minister communication of A most poor issueGrievingly I think The peace between the French and us not values The cost that did conclude itEvery man After the hideous storm that follow'd was A thing inspir'd and not consulting broke Into a general prophecythat this tempest Dashing the garment of this peace aboded The sudden breach on'tWhich is budded out For France hath flaw'd the league and hath attach'd Our merchants' goods at BordeauxIs it therefore Th' ambassador is silenc'dMarry is'tA proper tide of a peace and purchas'd At a superfluous rateWhy all this business Our reverend Cardinal carriedLike it your Grace The state takes notice of the private difference Betwixt you and the Cardinal I advise you And take it from a heart that wishes towards you Honour and plenteous safetythat you read The Cardinal's malice and his potency Together to consider further that What his high hatred would effect wants not A minister in his power You know his nature That he's revengeful and I know his sword Hath a sharp edgeit's long and't may be said It reaches far and where 'twill not extend Thither he darts it Bosom up my counsel You'll find it wholesome Lo where comes that rock That I advise your shunning the purse borne before him certain of the guard and twowith papers The in his passage fixeth his eye onand on him both full of disdainThe Duke of Buckingham's surveyor Ha Where's his examinationHere so please youIs he in person readyAy please your GraceWell we shall then know more and Buckingham shall lessen this big lookhis trainThis butcher's cur is venommouth'd and I Have not the power to muzzle him therefore best Not wake him in his slumber A beggar's book Outworths a noble's bloodWhat are you chaf'd Ask God for temp'rance that's th' appliance only Which your disease requiresI read in's looks Matter against me and his eye revil'd Me as his abject object At this instant He bores me with some trick He's gone to th' King I'll follow and outstare himStay my lord And let your reason with your choler question What 'tis you go about To climb steep hills Requires slow pace at first Anger is like A full hot horse who being allow'd his way Selfmettle tires him Not a man in England Can advise me like you be to yourself As you would to your friendI'll to the King And from a mouth of honour quite cry down This Ipswich fellow's insolence or proclaim There's difference in no personsBe advis'd Heat not a furnace for your foe so hot That it do singe yourself We may outrun By violent swiftness that which we run at And lose by overrunning Know you not The fire that mounts the liquor till't run o'er In seeming to augment it wastes it Be advis'd I say again there is no English soul More stronger to direct you than yourself If with the sap of reason you would quench Or but allay the fire of passionSir I am thankful to you and I'll go along By your prescription but this topproud fellow Whom from the flow of gan I name not but From sincere motions by intelligence And proofs as clear as founts in July when We see each grain of gravelI do know To be corrupt and treasonousSay not treasonousTo th' King I'll say't and make my vouch as strong As shore of rock Attend this holy fox Or wolf or bothfor he is equal rav'nous As he is subtle and as prone to mischief As able to perform't his mind and place Infecting one another yea reciprocally Only to show his pomp as well in France As here at home suggests the King our master To this last costly treaty th' interview That swallowed so much treasure and like a glass Did break i' th' wrenchingFaith and so it didPray give me favour sir this cunning cardinal The articles o' th' combination drew As himself pleas'd and they were ratified As he cried 'Thus let be' to as much end As give a crutch to th' dead But our CountCardinal Has done this and 'tis well for worthy Wolsey Who cannot err he did it Now this follows Which as I take it is a kind of puppy To th' old dam treason Charles the Emperor Under pretence to see the Queen his aunt For 'twas indeed his colour but he came To whisper Wolseyhere makes visitation His fears were that the interview betwixt England and France might through their amity Breed him some prejudice for from this league Peep'd harms that menac'd himprivily Deals with our Cardinal and as I trow Which I do well for I am sure the Emperor Paid ere he promis'd whereby his suit was granted Ere it was ask'dbut when the way was made And pav'd with gold the Emperor thus desir'd That he would please to alter the King's course And break the foresaid peace Let the King know As soon he shall by me that thus the Cardinal Does buy and sell his honour as he pleases And for his own advantageI am sorry To hear this of him and could wish he were Something mistaken in'tNo not a syllable I do pronounce him in that very shape He shall appear in proofa before him and two or

Repeat your will and take itThank your Majesty That you would love yourself and in that love Not unconsidered leave your honour nor The dignity of your office is the point Of my petitionLady mine proceedI am solicited not by a few And those of true condition that your subjects Are in great grievance there have been commissions Sent down among 'em which hath flaw'd the heart Of all their loyalties wherein although My good Lord Cardinal they vent reproaches Most bitterly on you as putteron Of these exactions yet the King our master Whose honour Heaven shield from soileven he escapes not Language unmannerly yea such which breaks The sides of loyalty and almost appears In loud rebellionNot almost appears It doth appear for upon these taxations The clothiers all not able to maintain The many to them 'longing have put of The spinsters carders fullers weavers who Unfit for other life compell'd by hunger And lack of other means in desperate manner Daring th' event to th' teeth are all in uproar And danger serves among themTaxation Wherein and what taxation My Lord Cardinal You that are blam'd for it alike with us Know you of this taxationPlease you sir I know but of a single part in aught Pertains to th' state and front but in that file Where others tell steps with meNo my lord You know no more than others But you frame Things that are known alike which are not wholesome To those which would not know them and yet must Perforce be their acquaintance These exactions Whereof my sovereign would have note they are Most pestilent to th' hearing and to bear 'em The back is sacrifice to th' load They say They are devis'd by you or else you suffer Too hard an exclamationStill exaction The nature of it In what kind let's know Is this exactionI am much too venturous In tempting of your patience but am bold'ned Under your promis'd pardon The subjects' grief Comes through commissions which compels from each The sixth part of his substance to be levied Without delay and the pretence for this Is nam'd your wars in France This makes bold mouths Tongues spit their duties out and cold hearts freeze Allegiance in them their curses now Live where their prayers did and it's come to pass This tractable obedience is a slave To each incensed will I would your Highness Would give it quick consideration for There is no primer businessBy my life This is against our pleasureAnd for me I have no further gone in this than by A single voice and that not pass'd me but By learned approbation of the judges If I am Traduc'd by ignorant tongues which neither know My faculties nor person yet will be The chronicles of my doing let me say 'Tis but the fate of place and the rough brake That virtue must go through We must not stint Our necessary actions in the fear To cope malicious censurers which ever As rav'nous fishes do a vessel follow That is newtrimm'd but benefit no further Than vainly longing What we oft do best By sick interpreters once weak ones is Not ours or not allow'd what worst as oft Hitting a grosser quality is cried up For our best act If we shall stand still In fear our motion will be mock'd or carp'd at We should take root here where we sit or sit Statestatues onlyThings done well And with a care exempt themselves from fear Things done without example in their issue Are to be fear'd Have you a precedent Of this commission I believe not any We must not rend our subjects from our laws And stick them in our will Sixth part of each A trembling contribution Why we take From every tree lop bark and part o' th' timber And though we leave it with a root thus hack'd The air will drink the sap To every county Where this is question'd send our letters with Free pardon to each man that has denied The force of this commission Pray look tot I put it to your careAside to the A word with you Let there be letters writ to every shire Of the King's grace and pardon The grieved commons Hardly conceive of melet it be nois'd That through our intercession this revokement And pardon comes I shall anon advise you Further in the proceedingI am sorry that the Duke of Buckingham Is run in your displeasureIt grieves many The gentleman is learn'd and a most rare speaker To nature none more bound his training such That he may furnish and instruct great teachers And never seek for aid out of himself Yet see When these so noble benefits shall prove Not well dispos'd the mind growing once corrupt They turn to vicious forms ten times more ugly Than ever they were fair This man so complete Who was enroll'd 'mongst wonders and when we Almost with ravish'd list'ning could not find His hour of speech a minutehe my lady Hath into monstrous habits put the graces That once were his and is become as black As if besmear'd in hell Sit by us you shall hear This was his gentleman in trustof him Things to strike honour sad Bid him recount The forerecited practices whereof We cannot feel too little hear too muchStand forth and with bold spirit relate what you Most like a careful subject have collected Out of the Duke of BuckinghamSpeak freelyFirst it was usual with himevery day It would infect his speechthat if the King Should without issue die he'll carry it so To make the sceptre his These very words I've heard him utter to his soninlaw Lord Aberga'ny to whom by oath he menac'd Revenge upon the CardinalPlease your Highness note This dangerous conception in this point Not friended by his wish to your high person His will is most malignant and it stretches Beyond you to your friendsMy learn'd Lord Cardinal Deliver all with charitySpeak on How grounded he his title to the crown Upon our fail To this point hast thou heard him At any time speak aughtHe was brought to this By a vain prophecy of Nicholas HentonWhat was that HentonSir a Chartreux friar His confessor who fed him every minute With words of sovereigntyHow know'st thou thisNot long before your Highness sped to France The Duke being at the Rose within the parish Saint Lawrence Poultney did of me demand What was the speech among the Londoners Concerning the French journey I replied Men fear'd the French would prove perfidious To the King's danger Presently the Duke Said 'twas the fear indeed and that he doubted 'Twould prove the verity of certain words Spoke by a holy monk 'that oft' says he 'Hath sent to me wishing me to permit John de la Car my chaplain a choice hour To hear from him a matter of some moment Whom after under the confession's seal He solemnly had sworn that what he spoke My chaplain to no creature living but To me should utter with demure confidence This pausingly ensu'd Neither the King nor's heirs Tell you the Duke shall prosper bid him strive To gain the love o' th' commonalty the Duke Shall govern England'If I know you well You were the Duke's surveyor and lost your office On the complaint o' th' tenants Take good heed You charge not in your spleen a noble person And spoil your nobler soul I say take heed Yes heartily beseech youLet him on Go forwardOn my soul I'll speak but truth I told my lord the Duke by th' devil's illusions The monk might be deceiv'd and that 'twas dangerous for him To ruminate on this so far until It forg'd him some design which being believ'd It was much like to do He answer'd 'Tush It can do me no damage' adding further That had the King in his last sickness fail'd The Cardinal's and Sir Thomas Lovell's heads Should have gone offHa what so rank Ah ha There's mischief in this man Canst thou say furtherI can my liegeProceedBeing at Greenwich After your Highness had reprov'd the Duke About Sir William BulmerI remember Of such a time being my sworn servant The Duke retain'd him his But on what hence'If' quoth he 'I for this had been committed As to
