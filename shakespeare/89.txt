advantage therefore hear us first These flags of France that are advanced here Before the eye and prospect of your town Have hither march'd to your endamagement The cannons have their bowels full of wrath And ready mounted are they to spit forth Their iron indignation 'gainst your walls All preparation for a bloody siege And merciless proceeding by these French Confront your city's eyes your winking gates And but for our approach those sleeping stones That as a waist doth girdle you about By the compulsion of their ordinance By this time from their fixed beds of lime Had been dishabited and wide havoc made For bloody power to rush upon your peace But on the sight of us your lawful king Who painfully with much expedient march Have brought a countercheck before your gates To save unscratch'd your city's threat'ned cheeks Behold the French amaz'd vouchsafe a parle And now instead of bullets wrapp'd in fire To make a shaking fever in your walls They shoot but calm words folded

'Tis not the roundure of your oldfac'd walls Can hide you from our messengers of war Though all these English and their discipline Were harbour'd in their rude circumference Then tell us shall your city call us lord In that behalf which we have challeng'd it Or shall we give the signal to our rage And stalk in blood to our possessionIn brief we are the King of England's subjects For him and in

and at the other hill Command the rest to stand God and our right Here after excursionsthe with trumpets to the gatesYou men of Angiers open wide your gates And let young Arthur Duke of Britaine in Who by the hand of France this day hath made Much work for tears in many an English mother Whose sons lie scattered on the bleeding ground Many a widow's husband grovelling lies Coldly embracing the discoloured earth And victory with little loss doth play Upon the dancing banners of the French Who are at hand triumphantly displayed Toconquerors and to proclaim Arthur of Britaine England's King and yourswith trumpetRejoice you men of Angiers ring your bells King John your king and England's doth approach Commander of this hot malicious day Their armours that march'd hence so silverbright Hither return all gilt with Frenchmen's blood There stuck no plume in any English crest That is removed by a staff of France Our colours do return in those same hands That did display them when we first march'd forth And like a jolly troop of huntsmen come Our lusty English all with purpled hands Dy'd in the dying slaughter of their foes Open your gates and give the victors wayHeralds from off our tow'rs we might behold From first to last the onset and retire Of both your armies whose equality By our best eyes cannot be censured Blood hath bought blood and blows have answer'd blows Strength match'd with strength and power confronted power Both are alike and both alike we like One must prove greatest While they weigh so even We hold our town for neither yet for boththe twowith their powers at several doorsFrance hast thou yet more blood to cast away Say shall the current of our right run on Whose passage vex'd with thy impediment Shall leave his native channel and o'erswell With course disturb'd even thy confining shores Unless thou let his silver water keep A peaceful progress to the oceanEngland thou hast not sav'd one drop of blood In this hot trial more than we of France Rather lost more And by this hand I swear That sways the earth this climate overlooks Before we will lay down our justborne arms We'll put thee down 'gainst whom these arms we bear Or add a royal number to the dead Gracing the scroll that tells of this war's loss With slaughter coupled to the name of kingsHa majesty how high thy glory tow'rs When the rich blood of kings is set on fire O now doth Death line his dead chaps with steel The swords of soldiers are his teeth his fangs And now he feasts mousing the flesh of men In undetermin'd differences of kings Why stand these royal fronts amazed thus Cry 'havoc' kings back to the stained field You equal potents fiery kindled spirits Then let confusion of one part confirm The other's peace Till then blows blood and deathWhose party do the townsmen yet admitSpeak citizens for England who's your kingThe King of England when we know the KingKnow him in us that here hold up his rightIn us that are our own great deputy And bear possession of our person here Lord of our presence Angiers and of youA greater pow'r than we denies all this And till it be undoubted we do lock Our former scruple in our strongbarr'd gates King'd of our fears until our fears resolv'd Be by some certain king purg'd and depos'dBy heaven these scroyles of Angiers flout you kings And stand securely on their battlements As in a theatre whence they gape and point At your industrious scenes and acts of death Your royal presences be rul'd by me Do like the mutines of Jerusalem Be friends awhile and both conjointly bend Your sharpest deeds of malice on this town By east and west let France and England mount Their battering cannon charged to the mouths Till their soulfearing clamours have brawl'd down The flinty ribs of this contemptuous city I'd play incessantly upon these jades Even till unfenced desolation Leave them as naked as the vulgar air That done dissever your united strengths And part your mingled colours once again Turn face to face and bloody point to point Then in a moment Fortune shall cull forth Out of one side her happy minion To whom in favour she shall give the day And kiss him with a glorious victory How like you this wild counsel mighty states Smacks it not something of the policyNow by the sky that hangs above our heads I like it well France shall we knit our pow'rs And lay this Angiers even with the ground Then after fight who shall be king of itAn if thou hast the mettle of a king Being wrong'd as we are by this peevish town Turn thou the mouth of thy artillery As we will ours against these saucy walls And when that we have dash'd them to the ground Why then defy each other and pellmell Make work upon ourselves for heaven or hellLet it be so Say where will you assaultWe from the west will send destruction Into this city's bosomI from the northOur thunder from the south Shall rain their drift of bullets on this town AsideO prudent discipline From north to south Austria and France shoot in each other's mouth I'll stir them to itCome away awayHear us great kings vouchsafe awhile to stay And I shall show you peace and fairfac'd league Win you this city without stroke or wound Rescue those breathing lives to die in beds That here come sacrifices for the field Persever not but hear me mighty kingsSpeak on with favour we are bent to hearThat daughter there of Spain the Lady Blanch Is niece to England look upon the years Of Lewis the Dauphin and that lovely maid If lusty love should go in quest of beauty Where should he find it fairer than in Blanch If zealous love should go in search of virtue Where should he find it purer than in Blanch If love ambitious sought a match of birth Whose veins bound richer blood than Lady Blanch Such as she is in beauty virtue birth Is the young Dauphin every way complete If not complete of say he is not she And she again wants nothing to name want If want it be not that she is not he He is the half part of a blessed man Left to be finished by such as she And she a fair divided excellence Whose fulness of perfection lies in him O two such silver currents when they join Do glorify the banks that bound them in And two such shores to two such streams made one Two such controlling bounds shall you be Kings To these two princes if you marry them This union shall do more than battery can To our fastclosed gates for at this match With swifter spleen than powder can enforce The mouth of passage shall we fling wide ope And give you entrance but without this match The sea enraged is not half so deaf Lions more confident mountains and rocks More free from motionno not Death himself In mortal fury half so peremptory As we to keep this cityHere's a stay That shakes the rotten carcass of old Death Out of his rags Here's a large mouth indeed That spits forth death and mountains rocks and seas Talks as familiarly of roaring lions As maids of thirteen do of puppydogs What cannoneer begot this lusty blood He speaks plain

Since I first call'd my brother's father dadSon list to this conjunction make this match Give with our niece a dowry large enough For by this knot thou shalt so surely tie Thy now unsur'd assurance to the crown That yon green boy shall have no sun to ripe The bloom that promiseth a mighty fruit I see a yielding in the looks of France Mark how they whisper Urge them while their souls Are capable of this ambition Lest zeal now melted by the windy breath Of soft petitions pity and remorse Cool and congeal again to what it wasWhy answer not the double majesties This friendly treaty of our threat'ned townSpeak England first that hath been forward first To speak unto this city what say youIf that the Dauphin there thy princely son Can in this book of beauty read 'I love' Her dowry shall weigh equal with a queen For Anjou and fair Touraine Maine Poictiers And all that we upon this side the sea Except this city now by us besieg'd Find liable to our crown and dignity Shall gild her bridal bed and make her rich In titles honours and promotions As she in beauty education blood Holds hand with any princess of the worldWhat say'st thou boy Look in the lady's faceI do my lord and in her eye I find A wonder or a wondrous miracle The shadow of myself form'd in her eye Which being but the shadow of your son Becomes a sun and makes your son a shadow I do protest I never lov'd myself

in you that makes him like That anything he sees which moves his liking I can with ease translate it to my will Or if you will to speak more properly I will enforce it eas'ly to my love Further I will not flatter you my lord That all I see in you is worthy love Than this that nothing do I see in you Though churlish thoughts themselves should be your judge That I can find should merit any hateWhat

English coin Philip of France if thou be pleas'd withal Command thy son and daughter to join handsIt likes us well young princes close your handsAnd your lips too for I am well assur'd That I did so when I was first assur'dNow citizens of Angiers ope your gates Let in that amity which you have made For at Saint Mary's chapel presently The rites of marriage shall be solemniz'd Is not the Lady Constance in this troop I know she is not for this match made up Her presence would have interrupted much Where is she and her son Tell me who knowsShe is sad and passionate at your Highness' tentAnd by my faith this league that we have made Will give her sadness very little cure Brother of England how may we content This widow lady In her right we came Which we God knows have turn'd another way To our own vantageWe will heal up all For we'll create young Arthur Duke of Britaine And Earl of Richmond and this rich fair town We make him lord of Call the Lady Constance Some speedy messenger bid her repair To our solemnity I trust we shall If not fill up the measure of her will Yet in some measure satisfy her so That we shall stop her exclamation Go we as well as haste will suffer us To this unlook'dfor unprepared pomp all but the Mad world mad kings mad composition John to stop Arthur's tide in the whole Hath willingly departed with a part And France whose armour conscience buckled on Whom zeal and charity brought to the field As God's own soldier rounded in the ear With that same purposechanger that sly devil That broker that still breaks the pate of faith That daily breakvow he that wins of all Of kings of beggars old men young men maids Who having no external thing to lose But the word 'maid' cheats the poor maid of that That smoothfac'd gentleman tickling commodity Commodity the bias of the world The world who of itself is peised well Made to run even upon even ground Till this advantage this viledrawing bias This sway of motion this commodity Makes it take head from all indifferency From all direction purpose course intent And this same bias this commodity This bawd this broker this allchanging word Clapp'd on the outward eye of fickle France Hath drawn him from his own determin'd aid From a resolv'd and honourable war To a most base and vileconcluded peace And why rail I on this commodity But for because he hath not woo'd me yet Not that I have the power to clutch my hand When his fair angels would salute my palm But for my hand as unattempted yet Like a poor beggar raileth on the rich Well whiles I am a beggar I will rail And say there is no sin but to be rich And being rich my virtue then shall be To say there is no vice but beggary Since kings break faith upon commodity Gain be my lord for I will worship thee
