Beforehouse with a letter What have I scap'd loveletters in the holidaytime of my beauty and am I now a subject for them Let me seeReads 'Ask me no reason why I love you for though Love use Reason for his precisian he admits him not for his counsellor You are not young no more am I go to then there's sympathy You are merry so am I ha ha then there's more sympathy You love sack and so do I would you desire better sympathy Let it suffice thee Mistress Page at the least if the love of soldier can sufficethat I love thee I will not say Pity me 'tis not a soldierlike phrase but I say Love me By me Thine own true knight By day or night Or any kind of light With all his might For thee to fight ' What a Herod of Jewry is this O wicked wicked world One that is wellnigh worn to pieces with age to show himself a young gallant What an unweighed behaviour hath this Flemish drunkard pick'dwith the devil's name out of my conversation that he dares in this manner assay me Why he hath not been thrice in my company What should I say to him I was then frugal of my mirth Heaven forgive me Why I'll exhibit a bill in the parliament for the putting down of men How shall I be reveng'd on him for reveng'd I will be as sure as his guts are made of puddingsMistress Page trust me I was going to your house And trust me I was coming to you You look very ill Nay I'll ne'er believe that I have to show to the contrary Faith but you do in my mind Well I do then yet I say I could show you to the contrary O Mistress Page give me some counsel What's the matter woman O woman if it were not for one trifling respect I could come to such honour Hang the trifle woman take the honour What is it Dispense with trifles what is it If I would but go to hell for an eternal moment or so I could be knighted What Thou liest Sir Alice Ford These knights will hack and so thou shouldst not alter the article of thy gentry We burn daylight Here read read perceive how I might be knighted I shall think the worse of fat men as long as I have an eye to make difference of men's liking And yet he would not swear prais'd women's modesty and gave such orderly and wellbehaved reproof to all uncomeliness that I would have sworn his disposition would have gone to the truth of his words but they do no more adhere and keep place together than the Hundredth Psalm to the tune of 'Greensleeves' What tempest I trow threw this whale with so many tuns of oil in his belly ashore at Windsor How shall I be revenged on him I think the best way were to tain him with hope till the wicked fire of lust have melted him in his own grease Did you ever hear the like Letter for letter but that the name of Page and Ford differs To thy great comfort in this mystery of ill opinions here's the twinbrother of thy letter but let thine inherit first for I protest mine never shall I warrant he hath a thousand of these letters writ with blank space for different namessure moreand these are of the second edition He will print them out of doubt for he cares not what he puts into the press when he would put us two I had rather be a giantess and lie under Mount Pelion Well I will find you twenty lascivious turtles ere one chaste man Why this is the very same the very hand the very words What doth he think of us Nay I know not it makes me almost ready to wrangle with mine own honesty I'll tain myself like one that I am not acquainted withal for sure unless he know some strain in me that I know not myself he would never have boarded me in this fury 'Boarding' call you it I'll be sure to keep him above deck So will I if he come under my hatches I'll never to sea again Let's be reveng'd on him let's appoint him a meeting give him a show of comfort in his suit and lead him on with a finebaited delay till he hath pawn'd his horses to mine host of the Garter Nay I will consent to act any villainy against him that may not sully the chariness of our honesty O that my husband saw this letter It would give eternal food to his jealousy Why look where he comes and my good man too he's as far from jealousy as I am from giving him cause and that I hope is an unmeasurable distance You are the happier woman Let's consult together against this greasy knight Come hither They retire withand with NymWell I hope it be not soHope is a curtal dog in some affairs Sir John affects thy wifeWhy sir my wife is not youngHe

know not how I may deserve to be your porterI will tell you sir if you will give me the hearingSpeak good Master Brook I shall be glad to be your servantSir I hear you are a scholarI will be brief with you and you have been a man long known to me though I had never so good means as desire to make myself acquainted with you I shall discover a thing to you wherein I must very much lay open mine own imperfection but good Sir John as you have one eye upon my follies as you hear them unfolded turn another into the register of your own that I may pass with a reproof the easier sith you yourself know how easy is it to be such an offenderVery well sir proceedThere is a gentlewoman in this town her husband's name is FordWell sirI have long lov'd her and I protest to you bestowed much on her followed her with a doting observance engross'd opportunities to meet her fee'd every slight occasion that could but niggardly give me sight of her not only bought many presents to give her but have given largely to many to know what she would have given briefly I have pursu'd her as love hath pursued me which hath been on the wing of all occasions But whatsoever I have merited either in my mind or in my means meed I am sure I have received none unless experience be a jewel that I have purchased at an infinite rate and that hath taught me to say this 'Love like a shadow flies when substance love pursues Pursuing that that flies and flying what pursues'Have you receiv'd no promise of satisfaction at her handsNeverHave you importun'd her to such a purposeNeverOf what quality was your love thenLike a fair house built on another man's ground so that I have lost my edifice by mistaking the place where erected itTo what purpose have you unfolded this to meWhen I have told you that I have told you all Some say that though she appear honest to me yet in other places she enlargeth her mirth so far that there is shrewd construction made of her Now Sir John here is the heart of my purpose you are a gentleman of excellent breeding admirable discourse of great admittance authentic in your place and person generally allow'd for your many warlike courtlike and learned preparationsO sirBelieve it for you know it There is money spend it spend it spend more spend all I have only give me so much of your time in exchange of it as to lay an amiable siege to the honesty of this Ford's wife use your art of wooing win her to consent to you if any man may you may as soon as anyWould it apply well to the vehemency of your affection that I should win what you would enjoy Methinks you prescribe to yourself very preposterouslyO understand my drift She dwells so securely on the excellency of her honour that the folly of my soul dares not present itself she is too bright to be look'd against Now could I come to her with any detection in my hand my desires had instance and argument to commend themselves I could drive her then from the ward of her purity her reputation her marriage vow and a thousand other her defences which now are too too strongly embattl'd against me What say you to't Sir JohnMaster Brook I will first make bold with your money next give me your hand and last as I am a gentleman you shall if you will enjoy Ford's wifeO good sirI say you shallWant no money Sir John you shall want noneWant no Mistress Ford Master Brook you shall want none I shall be with her

would you knew Ford sir that you might avoid him if you saw himHang him mechanical saltbutter rogue I will stare him out of his wits I will awe him with my cudgel it shall hang like a meteor o'er the cuckold's horns Master Brook thou shalt know I will predominate over the peasant and thou shalt lie with his wife Come to me soon at night Ford's a knave and I will aggravate his style thou Master Brook shalt know him for knave and cuckold Come to me soon at night What a damn'd Epicurean rascal is this My heart is ready to crack with impatience Who says this is improvident jealousy My wife hath sent to him the hour is fix'd the match is made Would any man have thought this See the hell of having a false woman My bed shall be abus'd my coffers ransack'd my reputation gnawn at and I shall not only receive this villainous wrong but stand under the adoption of abominable terms and by him that does me this wrong Terms names Amaimon sounds well Lucifer well Barbason well yet they are devils' additions the names of fiends But cuckold Wittol Cuckold the devil himself hath not such a name Page is an ass a secure ass he will trust his wife he will not be jealous I will rather trust a Fleming with my butter Parson Hugh the Welshman with my cheese an Irishman with my aquavitae bottle or a thief to walk my ambling gelding than my wife with herself Then she plots then she ruminates then she devises and what they think in their hearts they may effect they will break their hearts but they will effect God be prais'd for my jealousy Eleven o'clock the hour I will prevent this detect my wife
