shall we hear of thisA segregation of the Turkish fleet For do but stand upon the foaming shore The chidden billow seems to pelt the clouds The windshaked surge with high and monstrous mane Seems to

That gives me this bold show of courtesy Kisses herSir would she give you so much of her lips As of her tongue she oft bestows on me You'ld have enough Alas she has no speechIn faith too much I find it still when I have list to sleep Marry before your ladyship I grant She puts her tongue a little in her heart And chides with thinkingYou have little cause to say soCome on come on You are pictures out of doors Bells in your parlors wildcats in your kitchens Saints in your injuries devils being offended Players in your housewifery and housewives in your bedsO fie upon thee slandererNay it is true or else I am a Turk You rise to play and go to bed to workYou shall not write my praise No let me notWhat wouldst thou write of me if thou shouldst praise meO gentle lady do not put me to't For I am nothing if not criticalCome on assay There's one gone to the harborAy madamI am not merry but I do beguile The thing I am by seeming otherwise Come how wouldst thou praise meI am about it but indeed my invention Comes from my pate as birdlime does from frieze It plucks out brains and all But my Muse labors And thus she is deliver'd If she be fair and wise fairness and wit The one's for use the other useth itWell praised How if she be black and wittyIf she be black and thereto have a wit She'll find a white that shall her blackness fitWorse and worseHow if fair and foolishShe never yet was foolish that was fair For even her folly help'd her to an heirThese are old fond paradoxes to make fools laugh i' the alehouse What miserable praise hast thou for her that's foul and foolishThere's none so foul and foolish thereunto But does foul pranks which fair and wise ones doO heavy ignorance Thou praisest the worst best But what praise couldst thou bestow on a deserving woman indeed one that in the authority of her merit did justly put on the vouch of very malice itselfShe that was ever fair and never proud Had tongue at will and yet was never loud Never lack'd gold and yet went never gay Fled from her wish and yet said Now I may She that being anger'd her revenge being nigh Bade her wrong stay and her displeasure fly She that in wisdom never was so frail To change the cod's head for the salmon's tail She that could think and ne'er disclose her mind See suitors following and not look behind She was a wight if ever such wight wereTo do whatTo suckle fools and chronicle small beerO most lame and impotent conclusion Do not learn of him Emilia though he be thy husband How say you Cassio Is he not a most profane and liberal counselorHe speaks home madam You may relish him more in the soldier than in the scholarAside He takes her by the palm ay well said whisper With as little a web as this will I ensnare as great a fly as Cassio Ay smile upon her do I will gyve thee in thine own courtship You say true 'tis so indeed If such tricks as these strip you out of your lieutenantry it had been better you had not kissed your three fingers so oft which now again you are most apt to play the sir in Very good Well kissed an excellent courtesy 'tis so indeed Yet again your fingers to your lips Would they were clysterpipes for your sake Trumpet within The Moor I know his trumpet'Tis truly soLet's meet him and receive himLo where he comesOthello and AttendantsO my fair warrior My dear OthelloIt gives me wonder great as my content To see you here before me O my soul's joy If after every tempest come such calms May the winds blow till they have waken'd death And let the laboring bark climb hills of seas Olympushigh and duck again as low As hell's from heaven If it were now to die 'Twere now to be most happy for I fear My soul hath her content so absolute That not another comfort like to this Succeeds in unknown fate The heavens forbid But that our loves and comforts should increase Even as our days do grow Amen to that sweet powers I cannot speak enough of this content It stops me here it is too much of joy And this and this the greatest discords beKisses her That e'er our hearts shall makeAside O you are well tuned now But I'll set down the pegs that make this music As honest as I amCome let us to the castle News friends our wars are done the Turks are drown'd How does my old acquaintance of this isle Honey you shall be well desired in Cyprus I have found great love amongst them O my sweet I prattle out of fashion and I dote In mine own comforts I prithee good Iago Go to the bay and disembark my coffers Bring thou the master to the citadel He is a good one and his worthiness Does challenge much respect Come Desdemona Once more well met at Cyprusall but Iago and RoderigoDo thou meet me presently at the harbor Come hither If thou be'st valiant as they say base men being in love have then a nobility in their natures more than is native to them list me The lieutenant tonight watches on the court of guard First I must tell thee this Desdemona is directly in love with himWith him Why 'tis not possibleLay thy finger thus and let thy soul be instructed Mark me with what violence she first loved the Moor but for bragging and telling her fantastical lies And will she love him still for prating Let not thy discreet heart think it Her eye must be fed and what delight shall she have to look on the devil When the blood is made dull with the act of sport there should be again to inflame it and to give satiety a fresh appetite loveliness in favor sympathy in years manners and beauties all which the Moor is defective in Now for want of these required conveniences her delicate tenderness will find itself abused begin to heave the gorge disrelish and abhor the Moor very nature will instruct her in it and compel her to some second choice Now sir this granted as it is a most pregnant and unforced position who stands so eminently in the degree of this fortune as Cassio does A knave very voluble no further conscionable than in putting on the mere form of civil and humane seeming for the better compass of his salt and most hidden loose affection Why none why none a slipper and subtle knave a finder out of occasions that has an eye can stamp and counterfeit advantages though true advantage never present itself a devilish knave Besides the knave is handsome young and hath all those requisites in him that folly and green minds look after a pestilent complete knave and the woman hath found him alreadyI cannot believe that in her she's full of most blest conditionBlest fig'send The wine she drinks is made of grapes If she had been blest she would never have loved the Moor Blest pudding Didst thou not see her paddle with the palm of his hand Didst not mark thatYes that I did but that was but courtesyLechery by this hand an index and obscure prologue to the history of lust and foul thoughts They met so near with their lips that their breaths embraced together Villainous thoughts Roderigo When these mutualities so marshal the way hard at hand comes the master and main exercise the incorporate conclusion Pish But sir be you ruled by me I have brought you from Venice Watch you tonight for the command I'll lay't upon you Cassio knows you not I'll not be far from you Do you find some occasion to anger Cassio either by speaking too loud or tainting his discipline or from what other course you please which the time shall more favorably ministerWellSir he is rash and very sudden in choler and haply may strike at you Provoke him that he may for even out of that will I cause these of Cyprus to mutiny whose qualification shall come into no true taste again but by the displanting of Cassio So shall you have a shorter journey to your desires by the means I shall then have to prefer them and the impediment most profitably removed without the which there were no expectation of our prosperityI will do this if I can bring it to any opportunityI warrant thee Meet me by and by at the citadel I must fetch his necessaries ashore FarewellAdieuThat Cassio loves her I do well believe it That she loves him 'tis apt and of great credit The Moor howbeit that I endure him not Is of a constant loving noble nature And I dare think he'll prove to Desdemona A most dear husband Now I do love her too Not out of absolute lust though peradventure I stand accountant for as great a sin But partly led to diet my revenge For that I do suspect the lusty Moor Hath leap'd into my seat the thought whereof Doth like a poisonous mineral gnaw my inwards And nothing can or shall content my soul Till I am even'd with him wife for wife Or failing so yet that I put the Moor At least into a jealousy so strong That judgement cannot cure Which thing to do If this poor trash of Venice whom I trace For his quick hunting stand the putting on I'll have our Michael Cassio on the hip Abuse him to the Moor in the rank garb For I fear Cassio with my nightcap too Make the Moor thank me love me and reward me For making him egregiously an ass And practicing upon his peace and quiet Even to madness 'Tis here but yet confused Knavery's plain face is never seen till used A streeta Herald with a proclamation people followingIt is Othello's pleasure our noble and valiant general that upon certain tidings now arrived importing the mere perdition of the Turkish fleet every man put himself into triumph some to dance some to make bonfires each man to what sport and revels his addiction leads him for besides these beneficial news it is the celebration of his nuptial So much was his pleasure should be proclaimed All offices are open and there is full liberty of feasting from this present hour of five till the bell have told eleven Heaven bless the isle of Cyprus and our noble general OthelloA hall in the castleOthello Desdemona Cassio and AttendantsGood Michael look you to the guard tonight Let's teach

IagoWelcome Iago we must to the watchNot this hour lieutenant 'tis not yet ten o' the clock Our general cast us thus early for the love of his Desdemona who let us not therefore blame He hath not yet made wanton the night with her and she is sport for JoveShe's a most exquisite ladyAnd I'll warrant her full of gameIndeed she's a most fresh and delicate creatureWhat an eye she has Methinks it sounds a parley to provocationAn inviting eye and yet methinks right modestAnd when she speaks is it not an alarum to loveShe is indeed perfectionWell happiness to their sheets Come lieutenant I have a stope of wine and here without are a brace of Cyprus gallants that would fain have a measure to the health of black OthelloNot tonight good Iago I have very poor and unhappy brains for drinking I could well wish courtesy would invent some other custom of tainmentO they are our friends But one cup I'll drink for youI have drunk but one cup tonight and that was craftily qualified too and behold what innovation it makes here I am unfortunate in the infirmity and dare not task my weakness with any moreWhat man 'Tis a night of revels the gallants desire itWhere are theyHere at the door I pray you call them inI'll do't but it dislikes meIf I can fasten but one cup upon him With that which he hath drunk tonight already He'll be as full of quarrel and offense As my young mistress' dog Now my sick fool Roderigo Whom love hath turn'd almost the wrong side out To Desdemona hath tonight caroused Potations pottledeep and he's to watch Three lads of Cyprus noble swelling spirits That hold their honors in a wary distance The very elements of this warlike isle Have I tonight fluster'd with flowing cups And they watch too Now 'mongst this flock of drunkards Am I to put our Cassio in some action That may offend the isle But here they come If consequence do but approve my dream My boat sails freely both with wind and streamRe Cassio with him Montano and Gentlemen Servants following with wine'Fore God they have given me a rouse alreadyGood faith a little one not past a pint as I am a soldierSome wine ho Sings And let me the canakin clink clinkAnd let me the canakin clinkA soldier's a

lieutenantAy but by your leave not before me the lieutenant is to be saved before the ancient Let's have no more of this let's to our affairs God forgive us our sins Gentlemen let's look to our business Do not think gentlemen I am drunk this is my ancient this is my right hand and this is my left I am not drunk now I can stand well enough and I speak well enoughExcellent wellWhy very well then you must not think then that I am drunkTo the platform masters come let's set the watchYou see this fellow that is gone before He is a soldier fit to stand by Caesar And give direction And do but see his vice 'Tis to his virtue a just equinox The one as long as the other 'Tis pity of him I fear the trust Othello puts him in On some odd time of his infirmity Will shake this island But is he often thus'Tis evermore the prologue to his sleep He'll watch the horologe a double set If drink rock not his cradle It were well The general were put in mind of it Perhaps he sees it not or his good nature Prizes the virtue that appears in Cassio And looks not on his evils Is not this true RoderigoAside to him How now Roderigo I pray you after the lieutenant go RoderigoAnd 'tis great pity that the noble Moor Should hazard such a place as his own second With one of an ingraft infirmity It were an honest action to say So to the MoorNot I for this fair island I do love Cassio well and would do much To cure him of this evil But hark What noise A cry within Help help Re Cassio driving in Roderigo'Zounds You rogue You rascalWhat's the matter lieutenantA knave teach me my duty But I'll beat the

deathFaintsHold for your livesHold ho Lieutenant sir Montano gentlemen Have you forgot all place of sense and duty Hold the general speaks to you Hold hold for shameWhy how now ho from whence ariseth this Are we turn'd Turks and to ourselves do that Which heaven hath forbid the Ottomites For Christian shame put by this barbarous brawl He that stirs next to carve for his own rage Holds his soul light he dies upon his motion Silence that dreadful bell it frights the isle From her propriety What is the matter masters Honest Iago that look'st dead with grieving Speak who began this On thy love I charge theeI do not know Friends all but now even now In quarter and in terms like bride and groom Devesting them for bed and then but now As if some planet had unwitted men Swords out and tilting one at other's breast In opposition bloody I cannot speak Any beginning to this peevish odds And would in action glorious I had lost Those legs that brought me to a part of itHow comes it Michael you are thus forgotI pray you pardon me I cannot speakWorthy Montano you were wont be civil The gravity and stillness of your youth The world hath noted and your name is great In mouths of wisest censure What's the matter That you unlace your reputation thus And spend your rich opinion for the name Of a nightbrawler Give me answer to itWorthy Othello I am hurt to danger Your officer Iago can inform you While I spare speech which something now offends me Of all that I do know Nor know I aught By me that's said or done amiss this night Unless selfcharity be sometimes a vice And to defend ourselves it be a sin When violence assails us Now by heaven My blood begins my safer guides to rule And passion having my best judgement collied Assays to lead the way If I once stir Or do but lift this arm the best of you Shall sink in my rebuke Give me to know How this foul rout began who set it on And he that is approved in this offense Though he had twinn'd with me both at a birth Shall lose me What in a town of war Yet wild the people's hearts brimful of fear To manage private and domestic quarrel In night and on the court and guard of safety 'Tis monstrous Iago who began'tIf partially affined or leagued in office Thou dost deliver more or less than truth Thou art no soldier Touch me not so near I had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth Than it should do offense to Michael Cassio Yet I persuade myself to speak the truth Shall nothing wrong him Thus it is general Montano and myself being in speech There comes a fellow crying out for help And Cassio following him with determined sword To execute upon him Sir this gentleman Steps in to Cassio and entreats his pause Myself the crying fellow did pursue Lest by his clamor as it so fell out The town might fall in fright He swift of foot Outran my purpose and I return'd the rather For that I heard the clink and fall of swords And Cassio high in oath which till tonight I ne'er might say before When I came back For this was brief I found them close together At blow and thrust even as again they were When you yourself did part them More of this matter cannot I report But men are men the best sometimes forget Though Cassio did some little wrong to him As men in rage strike those that wish them best Yet surely Cassio I believe received From him that fled some strange indignity Which patience could not passI know Iago Thy honesty and love doth mince this matter Making it light to Cassio Cassio I love thee But never more be officer of mine Re Desdemona attended Look if my gentle love be not raised up I'll make thee an exampleWhat's the matterAll's well now sweeting come away to bed Sir for your hurts myself will be your surgeon Lead him offMontano attended Iago look with care about the town And silence those whom this vile brawl distracted Come Desdemona 'tis the soldiers' life To have their balmy slumbers waked with strifeall but Iago and CassioWhat are you hurt lieutenantAy past all surgeryMarry heaven forbidReputation reputation reputation O I have lost my reputation I have lost the immortal part of myself and what remains is bestial My reputation Iago my reputationAs I am an honest man I thought you had received some bodily wound there is more sense in that than in reputation Reputation is an idle and most false imposition oft got without merit and lost without deserving You have lost no reputation at all unless you repute yourself such a loser What man there are ways to recover the general again You are but now cast in his mood a punishment more in policy than in malice even so as one would beat his offenseless dog to affright an imperious lion Sue to him again and he's yoursI will rather sue to be despised than to deceive so good a commander with so slight so drunken and so indiscreet an officer Drunk and speak parrot and squabble swagger swear and discourse fustian with one's own shadow O thou invisible spirit of wine if thou hast no name to be known by let us call thee devilWhat was he that you followed with your sword What had he done to youI know notIs't possibleI remember a mass of things but nothing distinctly a quarrel but nothing wherefore O God that men should put an enemy in their mouths to steal away their brains that we should with joy pleasance revel and applause transform ourselves into beastsWhy but you are now well enough How came you thusrecoveredIt hath pleased the devil drunkenness to give place to the devil wrath one unperfectness shows me another to make me frankly despise myselfCome you are too severe a moraler As the time the place and the condition of this country stands I could heartily wish this had not befallen but since it is as it is mend it for your own goodI will ask him for my place again he shall tell me I am a drunkard Had I as many mouths as Hydra such an answer would stop them all To be now a sensible man by and by a fool and presently a beast O strange Every inordinate cup is unblest and the ingredient is a devilCome come good wine is a good familiar creature if it be well used Exclaim no more against it And good lieutenant I think you think I love youI have well approved it sir I drunkYou or any man living may be drunk at some time man I'll tell you what you shall do Our general's wife is now the general I may say so in this respect for that he hath devoted and given up himself to the contemplation mark and denotement of her parts and graces Confess yourself freely to her importune her help to put you in your place again She is of so free so kind so apt so blessed a disposition she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more than she is requested This broken joint between you and her husband entreat her to splinter and my fortunes against any lay worth naming this crack of your love shall grow stronger than it was beforeYou advise me wellI protest in the sincerity of love and honest kindnessI think it freely and betimes in the morning I will beseech the virtuous Desdemona to undertake for me I am desperate of my fortunes if they check me hereYou are in the right Good night lieutenant I must to the watchGood night honest IagoAnd what's he then that says I play the villain When this advice is free I give and honest Probal to thinking and indeed the course To win the Moor again For 'tis most easy The inclining Desdemona to subdue In any honest suit She's framed as fruitful As the free elements And then for her To win the Moor were't to renounce his baptism All seals and symbols of redeemed sin His soul is so enfetter'd to her love That she may make unmake do what she list Even as her appetite shall play the god With his weak function How am I then a villain To counsel Cassio to this parallel course Directly to his good Divinity of hell When devils will the blackest sins put on They do suggest at first with heavenly shows As I do now For whiles this honest fool Plies Desdemona to repair his fortune And she for him pleads strongly to the Moor I'll pour this pestilence into his ear That she repeals him for her body's lust And by how much she strives to do him good She shall undo her credit with the Moor So will I turn her virtue into pitch And out of her own goodness make the net That shall enmesh them all Roderigo How now RoderigoI do follow here in the chase not like a hound that hunts but one that fills up the cry My money is almost spent I have been tonight exceedingly well cudgeled and I think the issue will be I shall have so much experience for my pains and so with no money at all and a little more wit return again to VeniceHow poor are they that have not patience What wound did ever heal but by degrees Thou know'st we work by wit and not by witchcraft And wit depends on dilatory time Does't not go well Cassio hath beaten thee And thou by that small hurt hast cashier'd Cassio Though other things grow fair against the sun Yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe Content thyself awhile By the mass 'tis morning Pleasure and action make the hours seem short Retire thee go where thou art billeted Away I say Thou shalt know more hereafter Nay get thee goneRoderigo Two things are to be done My wife must move for Cassio to her mistress I'll set her on Myself the while to draw the Moor apart And bring him jump when he may Cassio find Soliciting his wife Ay that's the way Dull not device by coldness and delay
