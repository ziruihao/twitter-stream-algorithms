he doth it as like one of these harlotry players as ever I see Fal Peace good pintpot Peace good ticklebrain Harry I do not only marvel where thou spendest thy time but also how thou art accompanied For though the camomile the more it is trodden on the faster it grows yet youth the more it is wasted the sooner it wears That thou art my son I have partly thy mother's word partly my own opinion but chiefly a villanous trick of thine eye and a foolish hanging of thy nether lip that doth warrant me If then thou be son to me here lies the point why being son to me art thou so pointed at Shall the blessed sun of heaven prove a micher and eat blackberries A question not to be ask'd Shall the son of England prove a thief and take purses A question to be ask'd There is a thing Harry which thou hast often heard of and it is known to many in our land by the name of pitch This pitch as ancient writers do report doth defile so doth the company thou keepest For Harry now I do not speak to thee in drink but in tears not in pleasure but in passion not in words only but in woes also and yet there is a virtuous man whom I have often noted in thy company but I know nothis name Prince What manner of man an it like your Majesty Fal A goodly portly man i' faith and a corpulent of a cheerful look a pleasing eye and a most noble carriage and as I think his age some fifty or by'r Lady inclining to threescore and now I remember me his name is Falstaff If that man should be lewdly given he deceiveth me for Harry I see virtue in his looks If then the tree may be known by the fruit as the fruit by the tree then peremptorily I speak it there is virtue in that Falstaff Him keep with the rest banish And tell me now thou naughty varlet tell me where hast thou been this month Prince Dost thou speak like a king Do thou stand for me and I'll play my father Fal Depose me If thou dost it half so gravely so majestically both in word and matter hang me up by the heels for a rabbitsucker or a poulter's

lord they are false Nay I'll tickle ye for a young prince i' faith Prince Swearest thou ungracious boy Henceforth ne'er look on me Thou art violently carried away from grace There is a devil haunts thee in the likeness of an old fat man a tun of man is thy companion Why dost thou converse with that trunk of humours that bolting hutch of beastliness that swoll'n parcel of dropsies that huge bombard of sack that stuff'd cloakbag of guts that roasted Manningtree ox with the pudding in his belly that reverend vice that grey iniquity that father ruffian that vanity in years Wherein is he good but to taste sack and drink it wherein neat and cleanly but to carve a capon and eat it wherein cunning but in craft wherein crafty but in villany wherein villanous but in all things wherein worthy but in nothing Fal I would your Grace would take me with you Whom means your Grace Prince That villanous abominable misleader of youth Falstaff that old whitebearded Satan Fal My lord the man I know Prince I know thou dost Fal But to say I know more harm in him than in myself were to say more than I know That he is old the more the pity his white hairs do witness it but that he is saving your reverence a whoremaster that I utterly deny If sack and sugar be a fault God help the wicked If to be old and merry be a sin then many an old host that I know is damn'd If to be fat be to be hated then Pharaoh's lean kine are to be loved No my good lord Banish Peto banish Bardolph banish Poins but for sweet Jack Falstaff kind Jack Falstaff true Jack Falstaff valiant Jack Falstaff and
