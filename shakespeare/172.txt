soldier Iron may hold with her but never lutesWhy then thou canst not break her to the luteWhy no for she hath broke the lute to me I did but tell her she mistook her frets And bow'd her hand to teach her fingering When with a most impatient devilish spirit 'Frets call you these' quoth she 'I'll fume with them' And with that word she struck me on the head And through the instrument my pate made way And there I stood amazed for a while As on a pillory looking through the lute While she did call me rascal fiddler And twangling Jack with twenty such vile terms As she had studied to misuse me soNow

will not speak a word Then I'll commend her volubility And say she uttereth piercing eloquence If she do bid me pack I'll give her thanks As though she bid me stay by her a week If she deny to wed

swearing Jack That thinks with oaths to face the matter outFather 'tis thus yourself and all the world That talk'd of her have talk'd amiss of her If she be curst it is for policy Forshe's not froward but modest as the dove She is not hot but temperate as the morn For patience she will prove a second Grissel And Roman Lucrece for her chastity And to conclude we have 'greed so well together That

crowns In cypress chests my arras counterpoints Costly apparel tents and canopies Fine linen Turkey cushions boss'd with pearl Valance of Venice gold in needlework Pewter and brass and all things that belongs To house or housekeeping Then at my farm I have a hundred milchkine to the pail Six score fat oxen standing in my stalls And all things answerable to this portion Myself am struck in years I
