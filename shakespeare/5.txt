notWhat some'er he is He's bravely taken here He stole from France As 'tis reported for the King had married him Against his liking Think you it is soAy surely mere the truth I know his ladyThere is a gentleman that serves the Count Reports but coarsely of herWhat's his nameMonsieur ParollesO I believe with him In argument of praise or to the worth Of the great Count himself she is too mean To have her name repeated all her deserving Is a reserved honesty and that I have not heard examin'dAlas poor lady 'Tis a hard bondage to become the wife Of a detesting lordI sweet good creature wheresoe'er she is Her heart weighs sadly This young maid might do her A shrewd turn if she pleas'dHow do you mean May be the amorous Count solicits her In the unlawful purposeHe does indeed And brokes with all that can in such a suit Corrupt the tender honour of a maid But she is arm'd for him and keeps her guard In honestest defencewith drum and colours and the whole The gods forbid elseSo now they come That is Antonio the Duke's eldest son That EscalusWhich is the FrenchmanHe That with the plume 'tis a most gallant fellow I would he lov'd his wife if he were honester He were much goodlier Is't not a handsome gentlemanI like him well'Tis pity he is not honest Yond's that same knave That leads him to these places were I his lady I would poison that vile rascalWhich is heThat jackanapes with scarfs Why is he melancholyPerchance he's hurt i' th' battleLose our drum wellHe's shrewdly vex'd at something Look he has spied usMarry hang youAnd your courtesy for a ringcarrierand The troop is past Come pilgrim I will bring you Where you shall host Of enjoin'd penitents There's four or five to great Saint Jaques bound Already at my houseI humbly thank you Please it this matron and this gentle maid To eat with us tonight the charge and thanking Shall be for me and to requite you further I will bestow some precepts of this virgin Worthy the noteWe'll take your offer kindly Camp before Florence and the two Nay good my lord put him to't let him have his wayIf your lordship find him not a hiding hold me no more in your respectOn my life my lord a bubbleDo you think I am so far deceived in himBelieve it my lord in mine own direct knowledge without any malice but to speak of him as my kinsman he's a most notable coward an infinite and endless liar an hourly promisebreaker the owner of no one good quality worthy your lordship's tainmentIt were fit you knew him lest reposing too far in his virtue which he hath not he might at some great and trusty business in a main danger fail youI would I knew in what particular action to try himNone better than to let him fetch off his drum which you hear him so confidently undertake to doI with a troop of Florentines will suddenly surprise him such I will have whom I am sure he knows not from the enemy We will bind and hoodwink him so that he shall suppose no other but that he is carried into the leaguer of the adversaries when we bring him to our own tents Be but your lordship present at his examination if he do not for the promise of his life and in the highest compulsion of base fear offer to betray you and deliver all the intelligence in his power against you and that with the divine forfeit of his soul upon oath never trust my judgment in anythingO for the love of laughter let him fetch his drum he says he has a stratagem for't When your lordship sees the bottom of his success in't and to what metal this counterfeit lump of ore will be melted if you give him not John Drum's tainment your inclining cannot be removed Here he comesO for the love of laughter hinder not the honour of his design let him fetch off his drum in any handHow now monsieur This drum sticks sorely in your dispositionA pox on 't let it go 'tis but a drumBut a drum Is't but a drum A drum so lost There was excellent command to charge in with our horse upon our own wings and to rend our own soldiersThat was not to be blam'd in the command of the service it was a disaster of war that Caesar himself could not have prevented if he had been there to commandWell we cannot greatly condemn our success Some dishonour we had in the loss of that drum but it is not to be recoveredIt might have been recoveredIt might but it is not nowIt is to be recovered But that the merit of service is seldom attributed to the true and exact performer I would have that drum or another or 'hic jacet'Why if you have a stomach to't monsieur If you think your mystery in stratagem can bring this instrument of honour again into his native quarter be magnanimous in the prise and go on I will grace the attempt for a worthy exploit If you speed well in it the Duke shall both speak of it and extend to you what further becomes his greatness even to the utmost syllable of our worthinessBy the hand of a soldier I will undertake itBut you must not now slumber in itI'll about it this evening and I will presently pen down my dilemmas encourage myself in my certainty put myself into my mortal preparation and by midnight look to hear further from meMay I be bold to acquaint his Grace you are gone about itI know not what the success will be my lord but the attempt I vowI know th' art valiant and to the of thy soldiership will subscribe for thee FarewellI love not many wordsNo more than a fish loves water Is not this a strange fellow my lord that so confidently seems to undertake this business which he knows is not to be done damns himself to do and dares better be damn'd than to do 'tYou do not know him my lord as we do Certain it is that he will steal himself into a man's favour and for a week escape a great deal of discoveries but when you find him out you have him ever afterWhy do you think he will make no deed at all of this that so seriously he does address himself untoNone in the world but return with an invention and clap upon you two or three probable lies But we have almost emboss'd him You shall see his fall tonight for indeed he is not for your lordship's respectWe'll make you some sport with the fox ere we case him He was first smok'd by the old Lord Lafeu When his disguise and he is parted tell me what a sprat you shall find him which you shall see this very nightI must go look my twigs he shall be caughtYour brother he shall go along with meAs't please your lordship I'll leave you Now will I lead you to the house and show you The lass I spoke ofBut you say she's honestThat's all the fault I spoke with her but once And found her wondrous cold but I sent to her By this same coxcomb that we have i' th' wind Tokens and letters which she did resend And this is all I have done She's a fair creature Will you go see herWith all my heart my lord Florence Thehouseand If you misdoubt me that I am not she I know not how I shall assure you further But I shall lose the grounds I work uponThough my estate be fall'n I was well born Nothing acquainted with these businesses And would not put my reputation now In any staining actNor would I wish you give me trust the Count he is my husband And what to your sworn counsel I have spoken Is so from word to word and then you cannot By the good aid that I of you shall borrow Err in bestowing itI should believe you For you have show'd me that which well approves Y'are great in fortuneTake this purse of gold And let me buy your friendly help thus far Which I will overpay and pay again When I have found it The Count he woos your daughter Lays down his wanton siege before her beauty Resolv'd to carry her Let her in fine consent As we'll direct her how 'tis best to bear it Now his important blood will nought deny That she'll demand A ring the County wears That downward hath succeeded in his house From son to son some four or five descents Since the first father wore it This ring he holds In most rich choice yet in his idle fire To buy his will it would not seem too dear Howe'er repented afterNow I see The bottom of your purposeYou see it lawful then It is no more But that your daughter ere she seems as won Desires this ring appoints him an encounter In fine delivers me to fill the time Herself most chastely absent After this To marry her I'll add three thousand crowns To what is pass'd alreadyI have yielded Instruct my daughter how she shall persever That time and place with this deceit so lawful May prove coherent Every night he comes With musics of all sorts and songs compos'd To her unworthiness It nothing steads us To chide him from our eaves for he persists As if his life lay on 'tWhy then tonight Let us assay our plot which if it speed Is wicked meaning in a lawful deed And lawful meaning in a lawful act Where both not sin and yet a sinful fact But let's about it
