Without the walls of AthensLet me look back upon thee O thou wall That girdles in those wolves dive in the earth And fence not Athens Matrons turn incontinent Obedience fail in children Slaves and fools Pluck the grave wrinkled Senate from the bench And minister in their steads To general filths Convert o' th' instant green virginity Do't in your parents' eyes Bankrupts hold fast Rather than render back out with your knives And cut your trusters' throats Bound servants steal Largehanded robbers your grave masters are And pill by law Maid to thy master's bed Thy mistress is o' th' brothel Son of sixteen Pluck the lin'd crutch from thy old limping sire With it beat out his brains Piety and fear Religion to the gods peace justice truth Domestic awe nightrest and neighbourhood Instruction manners mysteries and trades Degrees observances customs and laws Decline to your confounding contraries And let confusion live Plagues incident to men Your potent and infectious fevers heap On Athens ripe for stroke Thou cold sciatica Cripple our senators that their limbs may halt As lamely as their manners Lust and liberty Creep in the minds and marrows of our youth That 'gainst the stream of virtue they may strive And drown themselves in riot Itches blains Sow all th' Athenian bosoms and their crop Be general leprosy Breath infect breath That their society as their friendship may Be merely poison Nothing I'll bear from thee But nakedness thou detestable town Take thou that too with multiplying bans Timon will to the woods where he shall find Th' unkindest beast more kinder than mankind The gods confound hear me you good gods all The Athenians both within and out that wall And grant as Timon grows his hate may grow To the whole race of mankind high and low Amen Athens 's house with two or three Hear you Master Steward where's our master Are we undone cast off nothing remainingAlack my fellows what should I say to you Let me be recorded by the righteous gods I am as poor as youSuch a house broke So noble a master fall'n All gone and not One friend to take his fortune by the arm And go along with himAs we do turn our backs From our companion thrown into his grave So his familiars to his buried fortunes Slink all away leave their false vows with him Like empty purses pick'd and his poor self A dedicated beggar to the air With his disease of allshunn'd poverty Walks like contempt alone More of our fellows other All broken implements of a ruin'd houseYet do our hearts wear Timon's livery That see I by our faces We are fellows still Serving alike in sorrow Leak'd is our bark And we poor mates stand on the dying deck Hearing the surges threat We must all part Into this sea of airGood fellows all The latest of my wealth I'll share amongst you Wherever we shall meet for Timon's sake Let's yet be fellows let's shake our heads and say As 'twere a knell unto our master's fortune 'We have seen better days' Let each take someGiving them money Nay put out all your hands Not one word more Thus part we rich in sorrow parting poor Embrace and part several ways O the fierce wretchedness that glory brings us Who would not wish to be from wealth exempt Since riches point to misery and contempt Who would be so mock'd with glory or to live But in a dream of friendship To have his pomp and all what state compounds But only painted like his varnish'd friends Poor honest lord brought low by his own heart Undone by goodness Strange unusual blood When man's worst sin is he does too much good Who then dares to be half so kind again For bounty that makes gods does still mar men My dearest lord blest to be most accurst Rich only to be wretched thy great fortunes Are made thy chief afflictions Alas kind lord He's flung in rage from this ingrateful seat Of monstrous friends nor has he with him to Supply his life or that which can command it I'll follow and enquire him out I'll ever serve his mind with my best will Whilst I have gold I'll be his steward stillThe woods near the seashore Beforecavein the woodsO blessed breeding sun draw from the earth Rotten humidity below thy sister's orb Infect the air Twinn'd brothers of one womb Whose procreation residence and birth Scarce is dividant touch them with several fortunes The greater scorns the lesser Not nature To whom all sores lay siege can bear great fortune But by contempt of nature Raise me this beggar and deny't that lord The senator shall bear contempt hereditary The beggar native honour It is the pasture lards the rother's sides The want that makes him lean Who dares who dares In purity of manhood stand upright And say 'This man's a flatterer' If one be So are they all for every grise of fortune Is smooth'd by that below The learned pate Ducks to the golden fool All's oblique There's nothing level in our cursed natures But direct villainy Therefore be abhorr'd All feasts societies and throngs of men His semblable yea himself Timon disdains Destruction fang mankind Earth yield me rootsDigging Who seeks for better of thee sauce his palate With thy most operant poison What is here Gold Yellow glittering precious gold No gods I am no idle votarist Roots you clear heavens Thus much of this will make black white foul fair Wrong right base noble old young coward valiant Ha you gods why this What this you gods Why this Will lug your priests and servants from your sides Pluck stout men's pillows from below their heads This yellow slave Will knit and break religions bless th' accurs'd Make the hoar leprosy ador'd place thieves And give them title knee and approbation With senators on the bench This is it That makes the wappen'd widow wed again She whom the spitalhouse and ulcerous sores Would cast the gorge at this embalms and spices To th 'April day again Come damn'd earth Thou common whore of mankind that puts odds Among the rout of nations I will make thee Do thy right natureMarch afar off Ha a drum Th'art quick But yet I'll bury thee Thou't go strong thief When gouty keepers of thee cannot stand Nay stay thou out for earnestKeeping some gold with drum and fife in warlike manner and and What art thou there SpeakA beast as thou art The canker gnaw thy heart For showing me again the eyes of manWhat is thy name Is man so hateful to thee That art thyself a manI am Misanthropos and hate mankind For thy part I do wish thou wert a dog That I might love thee somethingI know thee well But in thy fortunes am unlearn'd and strangeI know thee too and more than that I know thee I not desire to know Follow thy drum With man's blood paint the ground gules gules Religious canons civil laws are cruel Then what should war be This fell whore of thine Hath in her more destruction than thy sword For all her cherubin lookThy lips rot offI will not kiss thee then the rot returns To thine own lips againHow came the noble Timon to this changeAs the moon does by wanting light to give But then renew I could not like the moon There were no suns to borrow ofNoble Timon What friendship may I do theeNone but to Maintain my opinionWhat is it TimonPromise me friendship but perform none If thou wilt not promise the gods plague thee for thou art man If thou dost perform confound thee for thou art a manI have heard in some sort of thy miseriesThou saw'st them when I had prosperityI see them now then was a blessed timeAs thine is now held with a brace of harlotsIs this th' Athenian minion whom the world Voic'd so regardfullyArt thou TimandraYesBe a whore still they love thee not that use thee Give them diseases leaving with thee their lust Make use of thy salt hours Season the slaves For tubs and baths bring down rosecheek'd youth To the tubfast and the dietHang thee monsterPardon him sweet Timandra for his wits Are drown'd and lost in his calamities I have but little gold of late brave Timon The want whereof doth daily make revolt In my penurious band I have heard and griev'd How cursed Athens mindless of thy worth Forgetting thy great deeds when neighbour states But for thy sword and fortune trod upon themI prithee beat thy drum and get thee goneI am thy friend and pity thee dear TimonHow dost thou pity him whom thou dost trouble I had rather be aloneWhy fare thee well Here is some gold for theeKeep it I cannot eat itWhen I have laid proud Athens on a heapWar'st thou 'gainst AthensAy Timon and have causeThe gods confound them all in thy conquest And thee after when thou hast conquer'dWhy me TimonThat by killing of villains Thou wast born to conquer my country Put up thy gold Go on Here's gold Go on Be as a planetary plague when Jove Will o'er some highvic'd city hang his poison In the sick air let not thy sword skip one Pity not honour'd age for his white beard He is an usurer Strike me the counterfeit matron It is her habit only that is honest Herself's a bawd Let not the virgin's cheek Make soft thy trenchant sword for those milk paps That through the window bars bore at men's eyes Are not within the leaf of pity writ But set them down horrible traitors Spare not the babe Whose dimpled smiles from fools exhaust their mercy Think it a bastard whom the oracle Hath doubtfully pronounc'd thy throat shall cut And mince it sans remorse Swear against abjects Put armour on thine ears and on thine eyes Whose proof nor yells of mothers maids nor babes Nor sight of priests in holy vestments bleeding Shall pierce a jot There's gold to pay thy soldiers Make large confusion and thy fury spent Confounded be thyself Speak not be goneHast thou gold yet I'll take the gold thou givest me Not all thy counselDost thou or dost thou not heaven's curse upon theeGive us some gold good Timon Hast thou moreEnough to make a whore forswear her trade And to make whores a bawd Hold up you sluts Your aprons mountant you are not oathable Although I know you'll swear terribly swear Into strong shudders and to heavenly agues Th' immortal gods that hear you Spare your oaths I'll trust to your conditions Be whores still And he whose pious breath seeks to convert you Be strong in whore allure him burn him up Let your close fire predominate his smoke And be no turncoats Yet may your pains six months Be quite contrary And thatch your poor thin roofs With burdens of the dead some that were hang'd No matter Wear them betray with them Whore still Paint till a horse may mire upon your face A pox of wrinklesWell more gold What then Believe't that we'll do anything for goldConsumptions sow In hollow bones of man strike their sharp shins And mar men's spurring Crack the lawyer's voice That he may never more false title plead Nor sound his quillets shrilly Hoar the flamen That scolds against the quality of flesh And not believes himself Down with the nose Down with it flat take the bridge quite away Of him that his particular to foresee Smells from the general weal Make curl'dpate ruffians bald And let the unscarr'd braggarts of the war Derive some pain from you Plague all That your activity may defeat and quell The source of all erection There's more gold Do you damn others and let this damn you And ditches grave you allMore counsel with more money bounteous TimonMore whore more mischief first I have given

that harmMen daily find it Get thee away and take Thy beagles with theeWe but offend him Strike Drum beatsall but That nature being sick of man's unkindness Should yet be hungry Common mother thou Digging Whose womb unmeasurable and infinite breast Teems and feeds all whose selfsame mettle Whereof thy proud child arrogant man is puff'd Engenders the black toad and adder blue The gilded newt and eyeless venom'd worm With all th' abhorred births below crisp heaven Whereon Hyperion's quick'ning fire doth shine Yield him who all thy human sons doth hate From forth thy plenteous bosom one poor root Ensear thy fertile and conceptious womb Let it no more bring out ingrateful man Go great with tigers dragons wolves and bears Teem with new monsters whom thy upward face Hath to the marbled

thy youth In different beds of lust and never learn'd The icy precepts of respect but followed The sug'red game before thee But myself Who had the world as my confectionary The mouths the tongues the eyes and hearts of men At duty more than I could frame employment That numberless upon me stuck as leaves Do on the oak have with one winter's brush Fell from their boughs and left me open bare For every storm that blows I to bear this That never knew but better is some burden Thy nature did commence in sufferance time Hath made thee hard in't Why shouldst thou hate men They never flatter'd thee

wall that thou art out of the cityYonder comes a poet and a painter The plague of company light upon thee I will fear to catch it and give way When I know not what else to do I'll see thee againWhen there is nothing living but thee thou shalt be welcome I had rather be a beggar's dog than ApemantusThou art the cap of all the fools aliveWould thou wert clean enough to spit uponA plague on thee

friends drove him into this melancholyIt is nois'd he hath a mass of treasureLet us make the assay upon him if he care not for't he will supply us easily if he covetously reserve it how shall's get itTrue for he bears it not about him 'Tis hidIs not this heWhere'Tis his descriptionHe I know himSave thee TimonNow thievesSoldiers not thievesBoth too and women's sonsWe are not thieves but men that much do wantYour greatest want is you want much of meat Why should you want Behold the earth hath roots Within this mile break forth a hundred springs The oaks bear mast the briars scarlet hips The bounteous housewife Nature on each bush Lays her full mess before you Want Why wantWe cannot live on grass on berries water As beasts and birds and fishesNor on the beasts themselves the birds and fishes You must eat men Yet thanks I must you con That you are thieves profess'd that you work not In holier shapes for there is boundless theft In limited professions Rascal thieves Here's gold Go suck the subtle blood o' th' grape Till the high fever seethe your blood to froth And so scape hanging Trust not the physician His antidotes are poison and he slays Moe than you rob Take wealth and lives together Do villainy do since you protest to do't Like workmen I'll example you with thievery The sun's a thief and with his great attraction Robs the vast sea the moon's an arrant thief And her pale fire she snatches from the sun The sea's a thief whose liquid surge resolves The moon into salt tears the earth's a thief That feeds and breeds by a composture stol'n From gen'ral excrement each thing's a thief The laws your curb and whip in their rough power Has uncheck'd theft Love not yourselves away Rob one another There's more gold Cut throats All that you meet are thieves To Athens go Break open shops nothing can you steal But thieves do lose it Steal not less for this I give you and gold confound you howsoe'er AmenHas almost charm'd me from my profession by persuading me to it'Tis in the malice of mankind that he thus advises us not to have us thrive in our mysteryI'll believe him as an enemy and give over my tradeLet us first see peace in Athens There is no time so miserable but a man may be true to O you gods Is yond despis'd and ruinous man my lord Full of decay and failing O monument And wonder of good deeds evilly bestow'd What an alteration of honour Has desp'rate want made What viler thing upon the earth than friends Who can bring noblest minds to basest ends How rarely does it meet with this time's guise When man was wish'd to love his enemies Grant I may ever love and rather woo Those that would mischief me than those that do Has caught me in his eye I will present My honest grief unto him and as my lord Still serve him with my life My dearest masterAway What art thouHave you forgot me sirWhy dost ask that I have forgot all men Then if thou grant'st th'art a man I have forgot theeAn honest poor servant of yoursThen I know thee not I never had honest man about meAll I kept were knaves to serve in meat to villainsThe gods are witness Nev'r did poor steward wear a truer grief For his undone lord than mine eyes for youWhat dost thou weep Come nearer Then I love thee Because thou art a woman and disclaim'st Flinty mankind whose eyes do never give But thorough lust and laughter Pity's sleeping Strange times that weep with laughing not with weepingI beg of you to know me good my lord T' accept my grief and whilst this poor wealth lasts To tain me as your steward stillHad I a steward So true so just and now so comfortable It almost turns my dangerous nature mild Let me behold thy face Surely this man Was born of woman Forgive my general and exceptless rashness You perpetualsober gods I do proclaim One honest man mistake me not but one No more I pray and he's a steward How fain would I have hated all mankind And thou redeem'st thyself But all save thee I fell with curses Methinks thou art more honest now than wise For by oppressing and betraying me Thou mightst have sooner got another service For many so arrive at second masters Upon their first lord's neck But tell me true For I must ever doubt though ne'er so sure Is not thy kindness subtle covetous If not a usuring kindness and as rich men deal gifts Expecting in return twenty for oneNo my most worthy master in whose breast Doubt and suspect alas are plac'd too late You should have fear'd false times when you did feast Suspect still comes where an estate is least That which I show heaven knows is merely love Duty and zeal to your unmatched mind Care of your food and living and believe it My most honour'd lord For any benefit that points to me Either in hope or present I'd exchange For this one wish that you had power and wealth To requite me by making rich yourselfLook thee 'tis so Thou singly honest man Here take The gods out of my misery Have sent thee treasure Go live rich and happy But thus condition'd thou shalt build from men Hate all curse all show charity to none But let the famish'd flesh slide from the bone Ere thou relieve the beggar Give to dogs What thou deniest to men let prisons swallow 'em Debts wither 'em to nothing Be men like blasted woods And may diseases lick up their false bloods And so farewell and thriveO let me stay And comfort you my masterIf thou hat'st curses Stay not fly whilst thou art blest and free Ne'er see thou man and let me ne'er see theeseverally
