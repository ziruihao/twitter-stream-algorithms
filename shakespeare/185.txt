' house waiting to speak with to himI have told my lord of you he is coming down to youI thank you sir Here's my lordAside One of Lord Timon's men A gift I warrant Why this hits right I dreamt of a silver basin and ewer tonight Flaminius honest Flaminius you are very respectively welcome sir Fill me some wine And how does that honourable complete freehearted gentleman of Athens thy very bountiful good lord and masterHis health is well sirI am right glad that his health is well sir And what hast thou there under thy cloak pretty FlaminiusFaith nothing but an empty box sir which in my lord's behalf I come to entreat your honour to supplywho having great and instant occasion to use fifty talents hath sent to your lordship to furnish him nothing doubting your present assistance thereinLa la la la 'Nothing doubting' says he Alas good lord a noble gentleman 'tis if he would not keep so good a house Many a time and often I ha' din'd with him and told him on't and come again to supper to him of purpose to have him spend less and yet he would embrace no counsel take no warning by my coming Every man has his fault and honesty is his I ha' told him on't but I could ne'er get him from't Rewith winePlease your lordship here is the wineFlaminius I have noted thee always wise Here's to theeYour lordship speaks your pleasureI have observed thee always for a towardly prompt spirit give thee thy due and one that knows what belongs to reason and canst use the time well if the time use thee well Good parts in thee ToGet you gone sirrah Draw nearer honest Flaminius Thy lord's a bountiful gentleman but thou art wise and thou know'st well enough although thou com'st to me that this is no time to lend money especially upon bare friendship without security Here's three solidares for thee Good boy wink at me and say thou saw'st me not Fare thee wellIs't possible the world should so much differ And we alive that liv'd Fly damned baseness To him that worships thee Throwing the money backHa Now I see thou art a fool and fit for thy masterMay these add to the number that may scald thee Let molten coin be thy damnation Thou disease of a friend and not himself Has friendship such a faint and milky heart It turns in less than two nights O you gods I feel my master's passion This slave Unto his honour has my lord's meat in him Why should it thrive and turn to nutriment When he is turn'd to poison O may diseases only work upon't And when he's sick to death let not that part of nature Which my lord paid for be of any power To expel sickness but prolong his hourA public placeLucius with three Who the Lord Timon He is my very good friend and an honourable gentlemanWe know him for no less though we are but strangers to him But I can tell you one thing my lord and which I hear from common rumours now Lord Timon's happy hours are done and past and his estate shrinks from himFie no do not believe it he cannot want for moneyBut believe you this my lord that not long agoone of his men was with the Lord Lucullus to borrow so many talents nay urg'd extremely for't and showed what necessity belong'd to't and yet was deniedHowI tell you denied my lordWhat a strange case was that Now before the gods I am asham'd on't Denied that honourable man There was very little honour show'd in't For my own part I must needs confess I have received some small kindnesses from him as money plate jewels and suchlike trifles nothing comparing to his yet had he mistook him and sent to me I should ne'er have denied his occasion so many talents See by good hap yonder's my lord I have sweat to see his honour My honour'd lordServilius You are kindly met sir Fare thee well commend me to thy honourable virtuous lord my very exquisite friendMay it please your honour my lord hath sentHa What has he sent I am so much endeared to that lord he's ever sending How shall I thank him think'st thou And what has he sent nowHas only sent his present occasion now my lord requesting your lordship to supply his instant use with so many talentsI know his lordship is but merry with me He cannot want fiftyfive hundred talentsBut in the mean time he wants less my lord If his occasion were not virtuous I should not urge it half so faithfullyDost thou speak seriously ServiliusUpon my soul 'tis true sirWhat a wicked beast was I to disfurnish myself against such a good time when I might ha' shown myself honourable How unluckily it happ'ned that I should purchase the day before for a little part and undo a great deal of honour Servilius now before the gods I am not able to do the more beast I say I was sending to use Lord Timon myself these gentlemen can witness but I would not for the wealth of Athens I had done't now Commend me bountifully to his good lordship and I hope his honour will conceive the fairest of me because I have no power to be kind And tell him this from me I count it one of my greatest afflictions say that I cannot pleasure such an honourable gentleman Good Servilius will you befriend me so far as to use mine own words to himYes sir I shallI'll look you out a good turn Servilius True as you said Timon is shrunk indeed And he that's once denied will hardly speedDo you observe this HostiliusAy too wellWhy this is the world's soul and just of the same piece Is every flatterer's spirit Who can call him his friend That dips in the same dish For in my knowing Timon has been this lord's father And kept his credit with his purse Supported his estate nay Timon's money Has paid his men their wages He ne'er drinks But Timon's silver treads upon his lip And yet O see the monstrousness of man When he looks out in an ungrateful shape He does deny him in respect of his What charitable men afford to beggarsReligion groans at itFor mine own part I never tasted Timon in my life Nor came any of his bounties over me To mark me for his friend yet I protest For his right noble mind illustrious virtue And honourable carriage Had his necessity made use of me I would have put my wealth into donation And the best half should have return'd to him So much I love his heart But I perceive Men must learn now with pity to dispense For policy sits above conscience ' houseand a of Must he needs trouble me in't Hum 'Bove all others He might have tried Lord Lucius or Lucullus And now Ventidius is wealthy too Whom he redeem'd from prison All these Owe their estates unto himMy lord They have all been touch'd and found base metal for They have all denied himHow Have they denied him Has Ventidius and Lucullus denied him And does he send to me Three Humh It shows but little love or judgment in him Must I be his last refuge His friends like physicians Thrice give him over Must I take th' cure upon me Has much disgrac'd me in't I'm angry at him That might have known my place I see no sense for't But his occasions might have woo'd me first For in my conscience I was the first man That e'er received gift from him And does he think so backwardly of me now That I'll requite it last No So it may prove an argument of laughter To th' rest and I 'mongst lords be thought a fool I'd rather than the worth of thrice the sum Had sent to me first but for my mind's sake I'd such a courage to do him good But now return And with their faint reply this answer join Who bates mine honour shall not know my coin Excellent Your lordship's a goodly villain The devil knew not what he did when he made man politic he cross'd himself by't and I cannot think but in the end the villainies of man will set him clear How fairly this lord strives to appear foul Takes virtuous copies to be wicked like those that under hot ardent zeal would set whole realms on fire Of such a nature is his politic love This was my lord's best hope now all are fled Save only the gods Now his friends are dead Doors that were ne'er acquainted with their wards Many a bounteous year must be employ'd Now to guard sure their master And this is all a liberal course allows Who cannot keep his wealth must keep his house A hall inhousetwo Of meeting 'and others all being servants of 's creditors to wait for his coming out ThenandWell met good morrow Titus and HortensiusThe like to you kind VarroLucius What do we meet together 'Ay and I think one business does command us all for mine is moneySo is theirs and ours 'And Sir Philotus tooGood day at once 'welcome good brother what do you think the hourLabouring for nine 'So muchIs not my lord seen yet 'Not yetI wonder on't he was wont to shine at seven 'Ay but the days are wax'd shorter with him You must consider that a prodigal course Is like the sun's but not like his recoverable I fear 'Tis deepest winter in Lord Timon's purse That is one may reach deep enough and yet Find littleI am of your fear for thatI'll show you how t' observe a strange event Your lord sends now for moneyMost true he doesAnd he wears jewels now of Timon's gift For which I wait for moneyIt is against my heart 'Mark how strange it shows Timon in this should pay more than he owes And e'en as if your lord should wear rich jewels And send for money for 'emI'm weary of this charge the gods can witness I know my lord hath spent of Timon's wealth And now ingratitude makes it worse than stealth Yes mine's three thousand crowns what's yours 'Five thousand mine 'Tis much deep and it should seem by th' sum Your master's confidence was above mine Else surely his had equall'd One of Lord Timon's men 'Flaminius Sir a word Pray is my lord ready to come forthNo indeed he is notWe attend his lordship pray signify so muchI need not tell him that he knows you are to diligentin a cloak muffled 'Ha Is not that his steward muffled so He goes away in a cloud Call him call himDo you hear sir By your leave sirWhat do ye ask of me my friendWe wait for certain money here sirAy If money were as certain as your waiting 'Twere sure enough Why then preferr'd you not your sums and bills When your false masters eat of my lord's meat Then they could smile and fawn upon his debts And take down th' int'rest into their glutt'nous maws You do yourselves but wrong to stir me up Let me pass quietly Believe't my lord and I have made an end I have no more to reckon he to spend 'Ay but this answer will not serveIf 'twill not serve 'tis not so base as you For you serve knavesHow What does his cashier'd worship mutter No matter what he's poor and that's revenge enough Who can speak broader than he that has no house to put his head in Such may rail against great buildingsO here's Servilius now we shall know some answerIf I might beseech you gentlemen to repair some other hour I should derive much from't for take't of my soul my lord leans wondrously to discontent His comfortable temper has forsook him he's much out of health and keeps his chamber 'Many do keep their chambers are not sick And if it be so far beyond his health Methinks he should the sooner pay his debts And make a clear way to the godsGood godsWe cannot take this for answer sirWithin Servilius help My lord my lordin a rage followingWhat are my doors oppos'd against my passage Have I been ever free and must my house Be my retentive enemy my gaol The place which I have feasted does it now Like all mankind show me an iron heart 'Put in now TitusMy lord here is my bill 'Here's mineAnd mine my lord And ours my lordAll our billsKnock me down with 'em cleave me to the girdle 'Alas my lordCut my heart in sumsMine fifty talentsTell out my blood 'Five thousand crowns my lordFive thousand drops pays that What yours and yours

They have e'en put my breath from me the slaves Creditors DevilsMy dear lordWhat if it should be soMy lordI'll have it so My stewardHere my lordSo fitly Go bid all my friends again Lucius Lucullus and Sempronius all I'll once more feast the rascalsO my lord You only speak from your distracted soul There is not so much left to furnish out A moderate tableBe it not in thy care Go I charge thee invite them all let in the tide Of knaves once more my cook and I'll provideThe Senate Housethree at one door meeting them with attendantsMy lord you have my voice to't the fault's bloody 'Tis necessary he should die Nothing emboldens sin so much as mercyMost true the law shall bruise himHonour health and compassion to the SenateNow CaptainI am an humble suitor to your virtues For pity is the virtue of the law And none but tyrants use it cruelly It pleases time and fortune to lie heavy Upon a friend of mine who in hot blood Hath stepp'd into the law which is past depth To those that without heed do plunge into't He is a man setting his fate aside Of comely virtues Nor did he soil the fact with cowardice An honour in him which buys out his fault But with a noble fury and fair spirit Seeing his reputation touch'd to death He did oppose his foe And with such sober and unnoted passion He did behove his anger ere 'twas spent As if he had but prov'd an argumentYou undergo too strict a paradox Striving to make an ugly deed look fair Your words have took such pains as if they labour'd To bring manslaughter into form and set Quarrelling upon the head of valour which indeed Is valour misbegot and came into the world When sects and factions were newly born He's truly valiant that can wisely suffer The worst that man can breathe And make his wrongs his outsides To wear them like his raiment carelessly And ne'er prefer his injuries to his heart To bring it into danger If wrongs be evils and enforce us kill What folly 'tis to hazard life for illMy lordYou cannot make gross sins look clear To revenge is no valour but to bearMy lords then under favour pardon me If I speak like a captain Why do fond men expose themselves to battle And not endure all threats Sleep upon't And let the foes quietly cut their throats Without repugnancy If there be Such valour in the bearing what make we Abroad Why then women are more valiant That stay at home if bearing carry it And the ass more captain than the lion the fellow Loaden with irons wiser than the judge If wisdom be in suffering O my lords As you are great be pitifully good Who cannot condemn rashness in cold blood To kill I grant is sin's extremest gust But in defence by mercy 'tis most just To be in anger is impiety But who is man that is not angry Weigh but the crime with thisYou breathe in vainIn vain His service done At Lacedaemon and Byzantium Were a sufficient briber for his lifeWhat's thatWhy I say my lords has done fair service And slain in fight many of your enemies How full of valour did he bear himself In the last conflict and made plenteous woundsHe has made too much plenty with 'em He's a sworn rioter he has a sin that often Drowns him and takes his valour prisoner If there were no foes that were enough To overcome him In that beastly fury He has been known to commit outrages And cherish factions 'Tis inferr'd to us His days are foul and his drink dangerousHe diesHard fate He might have died in war My lords if not for any parts in him Though his right arm might purchase his own time And be in debt to none yet more to move you Take my deserts to his and join 'em both And for I know your reverend ages love Security I'll pawn my victories all My honours to you upon his good returns If by this crime he owes the law his life Why let the war receive't in valiant gore For law is strict and war is nothing moreWe are for law he dies Urge it no more On height of our displeasure Friend or brother He forfeits his own blood that spills anotherMust it be so It must not be My lords I do beseech you know meHowCall me to your remembrancesWhatI cannot think but your age has forgot me It could not else be I should prove so base To sue and be denied such common grace My wounds ache at youDo you dare our anger 'Tis in few words but spacious in effect We banish thee for everBanish me Banish your dotage Banish usury That makes the Senate uglyIf after two days' shine Athens contain thee Attend our weightier judgment And not to swell our spirit He shall be executed presently Now the gods keep you old enough that you may live Only in bone that none may look on you I'm worse than mad I have kept back their foes While they have told their money and let out Their coin upon large interest I myself Rich only in large hurts All those for this Is this the balsam that the usuring Senate Pours into captains' wounds Banishment It comes not ill I hate not to be banish'd It is a cause worthy my spleen and fury That I may strike at Athens I'll cheer up My discontented troops and lay for hearts 'Tis honour with most lands to be at odds Soldiers should brook as little wrongs as gods A banqueting hall inhouse Music Tables set out servants attendingdiversfriends ofat several doorsThe good time of day to you sirI also wish it to you I think this honourable lord did but try us this other dayUpon that were my thoughts tiring when we encount'red I hope it is not so low with him as he made it seem in the trial of his several friendsIt should not be by the persuasion of his new feastingI should think so He hath sent me an earnest inviting which many my near occasions did urge me to put off but he hath conjur'd me beyond them and I must needs appearIn like manner was I in debt to my importunate business but he would not hear my excuse I am sorry when he sent to borrow of me that my provision was outI am sick of that grief too as I understand how all things goEvery man here's so What would he have borrowed of youA thousand piecesA thousand piecesWhat of youHe sent to me sir here he comes and attendantsWith all my heart gentlemen both And how fare youEver at the best hearing well of your lordshipThe swallow follows not summer more willing than we your lordshipAside Nor more willingly leaves winter such summerbirds are men Gentlemen our dinner will not recompense this long stay feast your ears with the music awhile if they will fare so harshly o' th' trumpet's sound we shall to't presentlyI hope it remains not unkindly with your lordship that I return'd you an empty messengerO sir let it not trouble youMy noble lordAh my good friend what cheerMy most honourable lord I am e'en sick of shame that when your lordship this other day sent to me I was so unfortunate a beggarThink not on't sirIf you had sent but two hours beforeLet it not cumber your better remembrance The banquet brought in Come bring in all togetherAll cover'd dishesRoyal cheer I warrant youDoubt not that if money and the season can yield itHow do you What's the newsAlcibiades is banish'd Hear you of itAlcibiades banish'd'Tis so be sure of itHow howI pray you upon whatMy worthy friends will you draw nearI'll tell you more anon Here's a noble feast towardThis is the old man stillWill't hold Will't holdIt does but time will and soI do conceiveEach man to his stool with that spur as he would to the lip of his mistress your diet shall be in all places alike Make not a city feast of it to let the meat cool ere we can agree upon the first place Sit sit The gods require our thanks You great benefactors sprinkle our society with thankfulness For your own gifts make yourselves prais'd but reserve still to give lest your deities be despised Lend to each man enough that one need not lend to another for were your godheads to borrow of men men would forsake the gods Make the meat be beloved more than the man that gives it Let no assembly of twenty be without a score of villains If there sit twelve women at the table let a dozen of them be as they are The rest of your foes O gods the senators of Athens together with the common lag of people what is amiss in them you gods make suitable for destruction For these my present friends as they are to me nothing so in nothing bless them and to nothing are they welcome Uncover dogs and lapThe dishes are uncovered and seen to he full of warm waterWhat does his lordship meanI know notMay you a better feast never behold You knot of mouthfriends Smoke and lukewarm water Is your perfection This is Timon's last Who stuck and spangled with your flatteries Washes it off and sprinkles in your facesThrowing the water in their faces Your reeking villainy Live loath'd and long Most smiling smooth detested parasites Courteous destroyers affable wolves meek bears You fools of fortune trencher friends time's flies Cap and knee slaves vapours and minutelacks Of man and beast the infinite malady Crust you quite o'er What dost thou go Soft take thy physic first thou too and thou Stay I will lend thee money borrow none Throws the dishes at them and drives them out What all in motion Henceforth be no feast Whereat a villain's not a welcome guest Burn house Sink Athens Henceforth hated be Of Timon man and all humanityRe the How now my lordsKnow you the quality of Lord Timon's furyPush Did you see my capI have lost my gownHe's but a mad lord and nought but humours sways him He gave me a jewel th' other day and now he has beat it out of my hat Did you see my jewelDid you see my capHere 'tisHere lies my gownLet's make no stayLord Timon's madI feel't upon my bonesOne day he gives us diamonds next day stones
