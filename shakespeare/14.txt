The Forest of Ardenand two or threelike forestersNow my comates and brothers in exile Hath not old custom made this life more sweet Than that of painted pomp Are not these woods More free from peril than the envious court Here feel we not the penalty of Adam The seasons' difference as the icy fang And churlish chiding of the winter's wind Which when it bites and blows upon my body Even till I shrink with cold I smile and say 'This is no flattery these are counsellors That feelingly persuade me what I am' Sweet are the uses of adversity Which like the toad ugly and venomous Wears yet a precious jewel in his head And this our life exempt from public haunt Finds tongues in trees books in the running brooks Sermons in stones and good in everything I would not change itHappy is your Grace That can translate the stubbornness of fortune Into so quiet and so sweet a styleCome shall we go and kill us venison And yet it irks me the poor dappled fools Being native burghers of this desert city Should in their own confines with forked heads Have their round haunches gor'dIndeed my lord The melancholy Jaques grieves at that And in that kind swears you do more usurp Than doth your brother that hath banish'd you Today my Lord of Amiens and myself Did steal behind him as he lay along Under an oak whose antique root peeps out Upon the brook that brawls along this wood To the which place a poor sequest'red stag That from the hunter's aim had ta'en a hurt Did come to languish and indeed my lord The wretched animal heav'd forth such groans That their discharge did stretch his leathern coat Almost to bursting and the big round tears Cours'd one another down his innocent nose In piteous chase and thus the hairy fool Much marked of the melancholy Jaques Stood on th' extremest verge of the swift brook Augmenting it with tearsBut what said Jaques Did he not moralize this spectacleO yes into a thousand similes First for his weeping into the needless stream 'Poor deer' quoth he 'thou mak'st a testament As worldlings do giving thy sum of more To that which had too much' Then being there alone Left and abandoned of his velvet friends ''Tis right' quoth he 'thus misery doth part The flux of company' Anon a careless herd Full of the pasture jumps along by him And never stays to greet him 'Ay' quoth Jaques weep on you fat and greasy citizens 'Tis just the fashion Wherefore do you look Upon that poor and broken bankrupt there' Thus most invectively he pierceth through The body of the country city court Yea and of this our life swearing that we Are mere usurpers tyrants and what's worse To fright the animals and to kill them up In their assign'd and native dwellingplaceAnd did you leave him in this contemplationWe did my lord weeping and commenting Upon the sobbing deerShow me the place I love to cope him in these sullen fits For then he's full of matterI'll bring you to him straight Thepalace with Can it be possible that no man saw them It cannot be some villains of my court Are of consent and sufferance in thisI cannot hear of any that did see her The ladies her attendants of her chamber Saw her abed and in the morning early They found the bed untreasur'd of their mistressMy lord the roynish clown at whom so oft Your Grace was wont to laugh is also missing Hisperia the Princess' gentlewoman Confesses that she secretly o'erheard Your daughter and her cousin much commend The parts and graces of the wrestler That did but lately foil the sinewy Charles And she believes wherever they are gone That youth is surely in their companySend to his brother fetch that gallant hither If he be absent bring his brother to me I'll make him find him Do this suddenly And let not search and inquisition quail To bring again these foolish runawaysBeforehouseandmeetingWho's thereWhat my young master O my gentle master O my sweet master O you memory Of old Sir Rowland Why what make you here Why are you virtuous Why do people love you And wherefore are you gentle strong and valiant Why would you be so fond to overcome The bonny prizer of the humorous Duke Your praise is come too swiftly home before you Know you not master to some kind of men Their graces serve them but as enemies No more do yours Your virtues gentle master Are sanctified and holy traitors to you O what a world is this when what is comely Envenoms him that bears itWhy what's the matterO unhappy youth Come not within these doors within this roof The enemy of all your graces lives Your brother no no brother yet the son Yet not the son I will not call him son Of him I was about to call his father Hath heard your praises and this night he means To burn the lodging where you use to lie And you within it If he fail of that He will have other means to cut you off I overheard him and his practices This is no place this house is but a butchery Abhor it fear it do notitWhy whither Adam wouldst thou have me goNo matter whither so you come not hereWhat wouldst thou have me go and beg my food Or with a base and boist'rous sword enforce A thievish living on the common road This I must do or know not what to do Yet this I will not do do how I can I rather will subject me to the malice Of a diverted blood and bloody brotherBut do not so I have five hundred crowns The thrifty hire I sav'd under your father Which I did store to be my fosternurse When service should in my old limbs lie lame And unregarded age in corners thrown Take that and He that doth the ravens feed Yea providently caters for the sparrow Be comfort to my age Here is the gold All this I give you Let me be your servant Though I look old yet I am strong and lusty For in my youth I never did apply Hot and rebellious liquors in my blood Nor did not with unbashful forehead woo The means of weakness and debility Therefore my age is as a lusty winter Frosty but kindly Let me go with you I'll do the service of a younger man In all your business and necessitiesO good old man how well in thee appears The constant service of the antique world When service sweat for duty not for meed Thou art not for the fashion of these times Where none will sweat but for promotion And having that do choke their service up Even with the having it is not so with thee But poor old man thou prun'st a rotten tree That cannot so much as a blossom yield In lieu of all thy pains and husbandry But come thy ways we'll go along together And ere we have thy youthful wages spent We'll light upon some settled low contentMaster go on and I will follow the To the last gasp with truth and loyalty From seventeen years till now almost fourscore Here lived I but now live here no more At seventeen years many their fortunes seek But at fourscore it is too late a week Yet fortune cannot recompense me better Than to die well and not my master's debtorThe Forest of Ardenforforand alias O Jupiter how weary are my spiritsI Care not for my spirits if my legs were not wearyI could find in my heart to

food to thee Thy conceit is nearer death than thy powers For my sake be comfortable hold death awhile at the arm's end I will here be with the presently and if I bring thee not something to eat I will give thee leave to die but if thou diest before I come thou art a mocker of my labour Well said thou look'st cheerly and I'll be with thee quickly Yet thou liest in the bleak air Come I will bear thee

can nowhere find him like a manMy lord he is but even now gone hence Here was he merry hearing of a songIf he compact of jars grow musical We shall have shortly discord in the spheres Go seek him tell him I would speak with him He saves my labour by his own approachWhy how now monsieur what a life is this That your poor friends must woo your company What you look merrilyA fool a fool I met a fool i' th' forest A motley fool A miserable world As I do live by food I met a fool Who laid him down and bask'd him in the sun And rail'd on Lady Fortune in good terms In good set terms and yet a motley fool 'Good morrow fool' quoth I 'No sir' quoth he 'Call me not fool till heaven hath sent me fortune' And then he drew a dial from his poke And looking on it with lacklustre eye Says very wisely 'It is ten o'clock Thus we may see' quoth he 'how the world wags 'Tis but an hour ago since it was nine And after one hour more 'twill be eleven And so from hour to hour we ripe and ripe And then from hour to hour we rot and rot And thereby hangs a tale' When I did hear The motley fool thus moral on the time My lungs began to crow like chanticleer That fools should be so deep contemplative And I did laugh sans intermission An hour by his dial O noble fool A worthy fool Motley's the only wearWhat fool is thisO worthy fool One that hath been a courtier And says if ladies be but young and fair They have the gift to know it and in his brain Which is as dry as the remainder biscuit After a voyage he hath strange places cramm'd With observation the which he vents In mangled forms O that I were a fool I am ambitious for a motley coatThou shalt have oneIt is my only suit Provided that you weed your better judgments Of all opinion that grows rank in them That I am wise I must have liberty Withal as large a charter as the wind To blow on whom I please for so fools have And they that are most galled with my folly They most must laugh And why sir must they so The why is plain as way to parish church He that a fool doth very wisely hit Doth very foolishly although he smart Not to seem senseless of the bob if not The wise man's folly is anatomiz'd Even by the squand'ring glances of the fool Invest me in my motley give me leave To speak my mind and I will through and through Cleanse the foul body of th' infected world If they will patiently receive my medicineFie on thee I can tell what thou wouldst doWhat for a counter would I do but goodMost Mischievous foul sin in chiding sin For thou thyself hast been a libertine As sensual as the brutish sting itself And all th' embossed sores and headed evils That thou with license of free foot hast caught Wouldst thou disgorge into the general worldWhy who cries out on pride That can therein tax any private party Doth it not flow as hugely as the sea Till that the wearer's very means do ebb What woman in the city do I name When that I say the citywoman bears The cost of princes on unworthy shoulders Who can come in and say that I mean her When such a one as she such is her neighbour Or what is he of basest function That says his bravery is not on my cost Thinking that I mean him but therein suits His folly to the mettle of my speech There then how then what then Let me see wherein My tongue hath wrong'd him if it do him right Then he hath wrong'd himself if he be free Why then my taxing like a wildgoose flies Unclaim'd of any man But who comes here with his sword drawnForbear and eat no moreWhy I have eat none yetNor shalt not till necessity be serv'dOf what kind should this cock come ofArt thou thus bolden'd man by thy distress Or else a rude despiser of good manners That in civility thou seem'st so emptyYou touch'd my vein at first the thorny point Of bare distress hath ta'en from me the show Of smooth civility yet arn I inland bred And know some nurture But forbear I say He dies that touches any of this fruit Till I and my affairs are answeredAn you will not be answer'd with reason I must dieWhat would you have Your gentleness shall force More than your force move us to gentlenessI almost die for food and let me have itSit down and feed and welcome to our tableSpeak you so gently Pardon me I pray you I thought that all things had been savage here And therefore put I on the countenance Of stern commandment But whate'er you are That in this desert inaccessible Under the shade of melancholy boughs Lose and neglect the creeping hours of time If ever you have look'd on better days If ever been where bells have knoll'd to church If ever sat at any good man's feast If ever from your eyelids wip'd a tear And know what 'tis to pity and be pitied Let gentleness my strong enforcement be In the which hope I blush and hide my swordTrue is it that we have seen better days And have with holy bell been knoll'd to church And sat at good men's feasts and wip'd our eyes Of drops that sacred pity hath engend'red And therefore sit you down in gentleness And take upon command what help we have That to your wanting may be minist'redThen but forbear your food a little while Whiles like a doe I go to find my fawn And give it food There is an old poor man Who after me hath many a weary step Limp'd in pure love till he be first suffic'd Oppress'd with two weak evils age and hunger I will not touch a bitGo find him out And we will nothing waste till you returnI thank ye and be blest for your good comfortThou seest we are not all alone unhappy This wide and universal theatre Presents more woeful pageants than the scene Wherein we play inAll the world's a stage And all the men and women merely players They have their s and their entrances And one man in his time plays many parts His acts being seven ages At first the infant Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms Then the whining schoolboy with his satchel And shining morning face creeping like snail Unwillingly to school And then the lover Sighing like furnace with a woeful ballad Made to his mistress' eyebrow Then a soldier Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard Jealous in honour sudden and quick in quarrel Seeking the bubble reputation Even in the cannon's mouth And then the justice In fair round belly with good capon lin'd With eyes severe and beard of formal cut Full of wise saws and modern instances And so he plays his part The sixth age shifts Into the lean and slipper'd pantaloon With spectacles on nose and pouch on side His youthful hose well sav'd a world too wide For his shrunk shank and his big manly voice Turning again toward childish treble pipes And whistles in his sound Last scene of all That ends this strange eventful history Is second childishness and mere oblivion Sans teeth sans eyes sans taste sans every thing Re with Welcome Set down your venerable burden And let him feedI thank you most for himSo had you need I scarce can speak to thank you for myselfWelcome fall to I will not trouble you As yet to question you about your fortunes Give us some music and good cousin sing Blow blow thou winter wind Thou art not so unkind As man's ingratitude Thy tooth is not so keen Because thou art not seen Although thy breath be rude Heighho sing heighho unto the green holly Most friendship is feigning most loving mere folly Then heighho the holly This life is most jolly Freeze freeze thou bitter sky That dost not bite so nigh As benefits forgot Though thou

effigies witness Most truly limn'd and living in your face Be truly welcome hither I am the Duke That lov'd your father The residue of your fortune Go to my cave and tell me Good old man Thou art right welcome as thy master is Support him by the arm Give me your hand And let me all your fortunes understandThe palaceand Not see him since Sir sir that cannot be But were I not the better part

respect of itself it is a good life but in respect that it is a shepherd's life it is nought In respect that it is solitary I like it very well but in respect that it is private it is a very vile life Now in respect it is in the fields it pleaseth me well but in respect it is not in the court it is tedious As it is a spare life look you it fits my humour well but as there is no more plenty in it it goes much against my stomach Hast any philosophy in thee shepherdNo more but that I know the more one sickens the worse at ease he is and that he that wants money means and content is without three good friends that the property of rain is to wet and fire to burn that good pasture makes fat sheep and that a great cause of the night is lack of the sun that he that hath learned no wit by nature nor art may complain of good breeding or comes of a very dull kindredSuch a one is a natural philosopher Wast ever in court shepherdNo trulyThen thou art damn'dNay I hopeTruly thou art damn'd like an illroasted egg all on one sideFor not being at court Your reasonWhy if thou never wast at court thou never saw'st good manners if thou never saw'st good manners then thy manners must be wicked and wickedness is sin and sin is damnation Thou art in a parlous state shepherdNot a whit Touchstone Those that are good manners at the court are as ridiculous in the country as the behaviour of the country is most mockable at the court You told me you salute not at the court but you kiss your hands that courtesy would be uncleanly if courtiers were shepherdsInstance briefly come instanceWhy we are still handling our ewes and their fells you know are greasyWhy do not your courtier's hands sweat And is not the grease of a mutton as wholesome as the sweat of a man Shallow shallow A better instance I say comeBesides our hands are hardYour lips will feel them the sooner Shallow again A more sounder instance comeAnd they are often tarr'd over with the surgery of our sheep and would you have us kiss tar The courtier's hands are perfum'd with civetMost shallow man thou worm's meat in respect of a good piece of flesh indeed Learn of the wise and perpend civet is of a baser birth than

a true labourer I earn that I eat get that I wear owe no man hate envy no man's happiness glad of other men's good content with my harm and the greatest of my pride is to see my ewes graze and my lambs suckThat is another simple sin in you to bring the ewes and the rams together and to offer to get your living by the copulation of cattle to be bawd to a bellwether and to betray a shelamb of a twelvemonth to crookedpated old cuckoldly ram out of all reasonable match If thou beest not damn'd for this the devil himself will have no shepherds I cannot see else how thou shouldst scapeHere comes

foresterVery well what would youI pray you what is't o'clockYou should ask me what time o' day there's no clock in the forestThen there is no true lover in the forest else sighing every minute and groaning every hour would detect the lazy foot of Time as well as a clockAnd why not the swift foot of Time Had not that been as properBy no means sir Time travels in divers paces with divers persons I'll tell you who Time ambles withal who Time trots withal who Time gallops withal and who he stands still withalI prithee who doth he trot withalMarry he trots hard with a young maid between the contract of her marriage and the day it is solemniz'd if the interim be but a se'nnight Time's pace is so hard that it seems the length of seven yearWho ambles Time withalWith a priest that lacks Latin and a rich man that hath not the gout for the one sleeps easily because he cannot study and the other lives merrily because he feels no pain the one lacking the burden of lean and wasteful learning the other knowing no burden of heavy tedious penury These Time ambles withalWho doth he gallop withalWith a thief to the gallows for though he go as softly as foot can fall he thinks himself too soon thereWho stays it still withalWith lawyers in the vacation for they sleep between term and term and then they perceive not how Time movesWhere dwell you pretty youthWith this shepherdess my sister here in the skirts of the forest like fringe upon a petticoatAre you native of this placeAs the coney that you see dwell where she is kindledYour accent is something finer than you could purchase in so removed a dwellingI have been told so of many but indeed an old religious uncle of mine taught me to speak who was in his youth an inland man one that knew courtship too well for there he fell in love I have heard him read many lectures against it and I thank God I am not a woman to be touch'd with so many giddy offences as he hath generally tax'd their whole sex withalCan you remember any of the principal evils that he laid to the charge of womenThere were none principal they were all like one another as halfpence are every one fault seeming monstrous till his fellowfault came to match itI prithee recount some of themNo I will not cast away my physic but on those that are sick There is a man haunts the forest that abuses our young plants with carving 'Rosalind' on their barks hangs odes upon hawthorns and elegies on brambles all forsooth deifying the name of Rosalind If I could meet that fancymonger I would give him some good counsel for he seems to have the quotidian of love upon himI am he that is so loveshak'd I pray you tell me your remedyThere is none of my uncle's marks upon you he taught me how to know a man in love in which cage of rushes I am sure you are not prisonerWhat were his marksA lean cheek which you have not a blue eye and sunken which you have not an unquestionable spirit which you have not a beard neglected which you have not but I pardon you for that for simply your having in beard is a younger brother's revenue Then your hose should be ungarter'd your bonnet unbanded your sleeve unbutton'd your shoe untied and every thing about you demonstrating a careless desolation But you are no such man you are rather pointdevice in your accoutrements as loving yourself than seeming the lover of any otherFair youth I would I could make thee believe I loveMe believe it You may as soon make her that you love believe it which I warrant she is apter to do than to confess she does That is one of the points in the which women still give the lie to their consciences But in good sooth are you he that hangs the verses on the trees wherein Rosalind is so admiredI swear to thee youth by the white hand of Rosalind I am that he that unfortunate heBut are you so much in love as your rhymes speakNeither rhyme nor reason can express how muchLove is merely a madness and I tell you deserves as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do and the reason why they are not so punish'd and cured is that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers are in love too Yet I profess curing it by counselDid you ever cure any soYes one and in this manner He was to imagine me his love his mistress and I set him every day to woo me at which time would I being but a moonish youth grieve be effeminate changeable longing and liking proud fantastical apish shallow inconstant full of tears full of smiles for every passion something and for no passion truly anything as boys and women are for the most part cattle of this colour would now like him now loathe him then tain him then forswear him now weep for him then spit at him that I drave my suitor from his mad humour of love to a living humour of madness which was to forswear the full stream of the world and to live in a nook merely monastic And thus I cur'd him and this way will I take upon me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheep's heart that there shall not be one spot of love in 'tI would not be cured youthI would cure you if you would but call me Rosalind and come every day to my cote and woo meNow by the faith of my love I will Tell me where it isGo with me to it and I'll show it you and by the way you shall tell me where in the forest you live Will you goWith all my heart good youthNay you must call me Rosalind Come sister will you go The forestandbehindCome apace good Audrey I will fetch up your goats Audrey And how Audrey am I the man yet Doth my simple feature content youYour features Lord warrant us What featuresI am here with thee and thy goats as the most capricious poet honest Ovid was among the GothsAside O knowledge illinhabited worse than Jove in a thatch'd houseWhen a man's verses cannot be understood nor a man's good wit seconded with the forward child understanding it strikes a man more dead than a great reckoning in a little room Truly I would the gods had made thee poeticalI do not know what 'poetical' is Is it honest in deed and word Is it a true thingNo truly for the truest poetry is the most feigning and lovers are given to poetry and what they swear in poetry may be said as lovers they do feignDo you wish then that the gods had made me poeticalI do truly for thou swear'st to me thou art honest now if thou wert a poet I might have some hope thou didst feignWould you not have me honestNo truly unless thou wert hardfavour'd for honesty coupled to beauty is to have honey a sauce to sugarAside A material foolWell I am not fair and therefore I pray the gods make me honestTruly and to cast away honesty upon a foul slut were to put good meat into an unclean dishI am not a slut though I thank the gods I am foulWell praised be the gods for thy foulness sluttishness may come hereafter But be it as it may be I will marry thee and to that end I have been with Sir Oliver Martext the vicar of the next village who hath promis'd to meet me in this place of the forest and to couple usAside I would fain see this meetingWell the gods give us joyAmen A man may if he were of a fearful heart stagger in this attempt for here we have no temple but the wood no assembly but hornbeasts But what though Courage As horns are odious they are necessary It is said 'Many a man knows no end of his goods' Right Many a man has good horns and knows no end of them Well that is the dowry of his wife 'tis none of his own getting Horns Even so Poor men alone No no the noblest deer hath them as huge as the rascal Is the single man therefore blessed No as a wall'd town is more worthier than a village so is the forehead of a married man more honourable than the bare brow of a bachelor and by how much defence is better than no skill by so much is horn more precious than to want Here comes Sir OliverSir Oliver Martext you are well met Will you dispatch us here under this tree or shall we go with you to your chapelIs there none here to give the womanI will not take her on gift of any manTruly she must be given or the marriage is not lawfulDiscovering himself Proceed proceed I'll give herGood even good Master Whatyecall't how do you sir You are very well met Goddild you for your last company I am very glad to see you Even a toy in hand here sir Nay pray be cover'dWill you be married motleyAs the ox hath his bow sir the horse his curb and the falcon her bells so man hath his desires and as pigeons bill so wedlock would be nibblingAnd will you being a man of your breeding be married under a bush like a beggar Get you to church and have a good priest that can tell you what marriage is this fellow will but join you together as they join wainscot then one of you will prove a shrunk panel and like green timber warp warpAside I am not in the mind but I were better to be married of him than of another for he is not like to marry me well and not being well married it will be a good excuse for me hereafter to leave my wifeGo thou with me and let me counsel theeCome sweet Audrey We must be married or we must live in bawdry Farewell good Master Oliver NotO sweet OliverO brave OliverLeave me not behind thee ButWind awayBegone I sayI will not to wedding with thee and 'Tis no matter ne'er a fantastical knave of them all shall flout me out of my calling The forestand Never talk to me I will weepDo I prithee but yet have the grace to consider that tears do not become a manBut have I not cause to weepAs good cause as one would desire therefore weepHis very hair is of the dissembling colourSomething browner than Judas's Marry his kisses are Judas's own childrenI' faith his hair is of a good colourAn excellent colour your chestnut was ever the only colourAnd his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touch of holy breadHe hath bought a pair of cast lips of Diana A nun of winter's sisterhood kisses not more religiously the very ice of chastity is in themBut why did he swear he would come this morning and comes notNay certainly there is no truth in himDo you think soYes I think he is not a pickpurse nor a horsestealer but for his verity in love I do think him as concave as covered goblet or a wormeaten nutNot true in loveYes when he is in but I think he is not inYou have heard him swear downright he was'Was' is not 'is' besides the oath of a lover is no stronger than the word of a tapster they are both the confirmer of false reckonings He attends here in the forest on the Duke your fatherI met the Duke yesterday and had much question with him He asked me of what parentage I was I told him of as good as he so he laugh'd and let me go But what talk we of fathers when there is such a man as OrlandoO that's a brave man He writes brave verses speaks brave words swears brave oaths and breaks them bravely quite traverse athwart the heart of his lover as a puny tilter that spurs his horse but on one side breaks his staff like a noble goose But all's brave that youth mounts and folly guides Who comes here Mistress and master you have oft enquired After the shepherd that complain'd of love Who you saw sitting by me on the turf Praising the proud disdainful shepherdess That was his mistressWell and what of himIf you will see a pageant truly play'd Between the pale complexion of true love And the red glow of scorn and proud disdain Go hence a little and I shall conduct you If you will mark itO come let us remove The sight of lovers feedeth those in love Bring us to this sight and you shall say I'll prove a busy actor in their playAnother part of the forestand Sweet Phebe do not scorn me do not Phebe Say that you love me not but say not so In bitterness The common executioner Whose heart th' accustom'd sight of death makes hard Falls not the axe upon the humbled neck But first begs pardon Will you sterner be Than he that dies and lives by bloody dropsandat a distanceI would not be thy executioner I fly thee for I would not injure thee Thou tell'st me there is murder in mine eye 'Tis pretty sure and very probable That eyes that are the frail'st and softest things Who shut their coward gates on atomies Should be call'd tyrants butchers murderers Now I do frown on thee with all my heart And if mine eyes can wound now let them kill thee Now counterfeit to swoon why now fall down Or if thou canst not O for shame for shame Lie not to say mine eyes are murderers Now show the wound mine eye hath made in thee Scratch thee but with a pin and there remains Some scar of it lean upon a rush The cicatrice and capable impressure Thy palm some moment keeps but now mine eyes Which I have darted at thee hurt thee not Nor I am sure there is not force in eyes That can do hurtO dear Phebe If ever as that ever may be near You meet in some fresh cheek the power of fancy Then shall you know the wounds invisible That love's keen arrows makeBut till that time Come not thou near me and when that time comes Afflict me with thy mocks pity me not As till that time I shall not pity theeAdvancing And why I pray you Who might be your mother That you insult exult and all at once Over the wretched What though you have no beauty As by my faith I see no more in you Than without candle may go dark to bed Must you be therefore proud and pitiless Why what means this Why do you look on me I see no more in you than in the ordinary Of nature's salework 'Od's my little life I think she means to tangle my eyes too No faith proud mistress hope not after it 'Tis not your inky brows your black silk hair Your bugle eyeballs nor your cheek of cream That can entame my spirits to your worship You foolish shepherd wherefore do you follow her Like foggy south puffing with wind and rain You are a thousand times a properer man Than she a woman 'Tis such fools as you That makes the world full of illfavour'd children 'Tis not her glass but you that flatters her And out of you she sees herself more proper Than any of her lineaments can show her But mistress know yourself Down on your knees And thank heaven fasting for a good man's love For I must tell you friendly in your ear Sell when you can you are not for all markets Cry the man mercy love him take his offer Foul is most foul being foul to be a scoffer So take her to thee shepherd Fare you wellSweet youth I pray you chide a year together I had rather hear you chide than this man wooHe's fall'n in love with your foulness and she'll fall in love with my anger If it be so as fast as she answers thee with frowning looks I'll sauce her with bitter words Why look you so upon meFor no ill will I bear youI pray you do not fall in love with me For I am falser than vows made in wine Besides I like you not If you will know my house 'Tis at the tuft of olives here hard by Will you go sister Shepherd ply her hard Come sister Shepherdess look on him better And be not proud though all the world could see None could be so abus'd in sight as he Come to our flock and Dead shepherd now I find thy saw of might 'Who ever lov'd that lov'd not at first sight'Sweet PhebeHa what say'st thou SilviusSweet Phebe pity meWhy I arn sorry for thee gentle SilviusWherever sorrow is relief would be If you do sorrow at my grief in love By giving love your sorrow and my grief Were both extermin'dThou hast my love is not that neighbourlyI would have youWhy that were covetousness Silvius the time was that I hated thee And yet it is not that I bear thee love But since that thou canst talk of love so well Thy company which erst was irksome to me I will endure and I'll employ thee too But do not look for further recompense Than thine own gladness that thou art employ'dSo holy and so perfect is my love And I in such a poverty of grace That I shall think it a most plenteous crop To glean the broken ears after the man That the main harvest reaps loose now and then A scatt'red smile and that I'll live uponKnow'st thou the youth that spoke to me erewhileNot very well but I have met him oft And he hath bought the cottage and the bounds That the old carlot once was master ofThink not I love him though I ask for him 'Tis but a peevish boy yet he talks well But what care I for words Yet words do well When he that speaks them pleases those that hear It is a pretty youth not very pretty But sure he's proud and yet his pride becomes him He'll make a proper man The best thing in him Is his complexion and faster than his tongue Did make offence his eye did heal it up He is not very tall yet for his years he's tall His leg is but soso and yet 'tis well There was a pretty redness in his lip A little riper and more lusty red Than that mix'd in his cheek 'twas just the difference Betwixt the constant red and mingled damask There be some women Silvius had they mark'd him In parcels as I did would have gone near To fall in love with him but for my part I love him not nor hate him not and yet I have more cause to hate him than to love him For what had he to do to chide at me He said mine eyes were black and my hair black And now I am rememb'red scorn'd at me I marvel why I answer'd not again But that's all one omittance is no quittance I'll write to him a very taunting letter And thou shalt bear it wilt thou SilviusPhebe with all my heartI'll write it straight The matter's in my head and in my heart I will be bitter with him and passing short Go with me Silvius
