Fields between Dartford and Blackheath and his army of Irish with drum and coloursFrom Ireland thus comes York to claim his right And pluck the crown from feeble Henry's head Ring bells aloud burn bonfires clear and bright To tain great England's lawful king Ah sancta majestas who would not buy thee dear Let them obey that knows not how to rule This hand was made to handle nought but gold I cannot give due action to my words Except a sword or sceptre balance it A sceptre shall it have have I a soul On which I'll toss the flowerdeluce of FranceAside Whom have we here Buckingham to disturb me The King hath sent him sure I must dissembleYork if thou meanest well I greet thee wellHumphrey of Buckingham I accept thy greeting Art thou a messenger or come of pleasureA messenger from Henry our dread liege To know the reason of these arms in peace Or why thou being a subject as I am Against thy oath and true allegiance sworn Should raise so great a power without his leave Or dare to bring thy force so near the courtAside Scarce can I speak my choler is so great O I could hew up rocks and fight with flint I am so angry at these abject terms And now like Ajax Telamonius On sheep or oxen could I spend my fury I am far better born than is the King More like a king more kingly in my thoughts But I must make fair weather yet awhile Till Henry be more weak and I more strong Buckingham I prithee pardon me That I have given no answer all this while My mind was troubled with deep melancholy The cause why I have brought this army hither Is to remove proud Somerset from the King Seditious to his Grace and to the stateThat is too much presumption on thy part But if thy arms be to no other end The King hath yielded unto thy demand The Duke of Somerset is in the TowerUpon thine honour is he prisonerUpon mine honour he is prisonerThen Buckingham I do dismiss my pow'rs Soldiers I thank you all disperse yourselves Meet me tomorrow in Saint George's field You shall have pay and everything you wish And let my sovereign virtuous Henry Command my eldest son nay all my sons As pledges of my fealty and love I'll send them all as willing as I live Lands goods horse armour anything I have Is his to use so Somerset may dieYork I commend this kind submission We twain will go into his Highness' tenttheand attendantsBuckingham doth York intend no harm to us That thus he marcheth with thee arm in armIn all submission and humility York doth present himself unto your HighnessThen what intends these forces thou dost bringTo heave the traitor Somerset from hence And fight against that monstrous rebel Cade Who since I heard to be discomfited with 's headIf one so rude and of so mean condition May pass into the presence of a king Lo I present your Grace a traitor's head The head of Cade whom I in combat slewThe head of Cade Great God how just art Thou O let me view his visage being dead That living wrought me such exceeding trouble Tell me my friend art thou the man that slew himI was an't like your MajestyHow art thou call'd And what is thy degreeAlexander Iden that's my name A poor esquire of Kent that loves his kingSo please it you my lord 'twere not amiss He were created knight for his good serviceIden kneel down He kneels Rise up a knight We give thee for reward a thousand marks And will that thou thenceforth attend on usMay Iden live to merit such a bounty And never live but true unto his liegethe and See Buckingham Somerset comes with th' Queen Go bid her hide him quickly from the DukeFor thousand Yorks he shall not hide his head But boldly stand and front him to his faceHow now Is Somerset at liberty Then York unloose thy longimprisoned thoughts And let thy tongue be equal with thy heart Shall I endure the sight of Somerset False king why hast thou broken faith with me Knowing how hardly I can brook abuse King did I call thee No thou art not king Not fit to govern and rule multitudes Which dar'st not no nor canst not rule a traitor That head of thine doth not become a crown Thy hand is made to grasp a palmer's staff And not to grace an awful princely sceptre That gold must round engirt these brows of mine Whose smile and frown like to Achilles' spear Is able with the change to kill and cure Here is a hand to hold a sceptre up And with the same to act controlling laws Give place By heaven thou shalt rule no more O'er him whom heaven created for thy rulerO monstrous traitor I arrest thee York Of capital treason 'gainst the King and crown Obey audacious traitor kneel for graceWouldst have me kneel First let me ask of these If they can brook I bow a knee to man Sirrah call in my sons to be my bail attendant I know ere thy will have me go to ward They'll pawn their swords for my enfranchisementCall hither Clifford bid him come amain To say if that the bastard boys of York Shall be the surety for their traitor father O bloodbespotted Neapolitan Outcast of Naples England's bloody scourge The sons of York thy betters in their birth Shall be their father's bail and bane to those That for my surety will refuse the boys andSee where they come I'll warrant they'll make it good and his And here comes Clifford to deny their bailHealth and all happiness to my lord the King KneelsI thank thee Clifford Say what news with thee Nay do not fright us with an angry look We are thy sovereign Clifford kneel again For thy mistaking so we pardon theeThis is my King York I do not mistake But thou mistakes me much to think I do To Bedlam with him Is the man grown madAy Clifford a bedlam and ambitious humour Makes him oppose himself against his kingHe is a traitor let him to the Tower And chop away that factious pate of hisHe is arrested but will not obey His sons he says shall give their words for himWill you not sonsAy noble father if our words will serveAnd if words will not then our weapons shallWhy what a brood of traitors have we hereLook in a glass and call thy image so I am thy king and thou a falseheart traitor Call hither to the stake my two brave bears That with the very shaking of their chains They may astonish these felllurking curs Bid Salisbury and Warwick come to me theand Are these thy bears We'll bait thy bears to death And manacle the berard in their chains If thou dar'st bring them to the baitingplaceOft have I seen a hot o'er weening cur Run back and bite because he was withheld Who being suffer'd with the bear's fell paw Hath clapp'd his tail between his legs and cried And such a piece of service will you do If you oppose yourselves to match Lord WarwickHence heap of wrath foul indigested lump As crooked in thy manners as thy shapeNay we shall heat you thoroughly anonTake heed lest by your heat you burn yourselvesWhy Warwick hath thy knee forgot to bow Old Salisbury shame to thy silver hair Thou mad misleader of thy brainsick son What wilt thou on thy deathbed play the ruffian And seek for sorrow with thy spectacles O where is faith O where is loyalty If it be banish'd from the frosty head Where shall it find a harbour in the earth Wilt thou go dig a grave to find out war And shame thine honourable age with blood Why art thou old and want'st experience Or wherefore dost abuse it if thou hast it For shame In duty bend thy knee to me That bows unto the grave with mickle ageMy lord I have considered with myself The tide of this most renowned duke And in my conscience do repute his Grace The rightful heir to England's royal seatHast thou not sworn allegiance unto meI haveCanst thou dispense with heaven for such an oathIt is great sin to swear unto a sin But greater sin to keep a sinful oath Who can be bound by any solemn vow To do a murd'rous deed to rob a man To force a spotless virgin's chastity To reave the orphan of his patrimony To wring the widow from her custom'd right And have no other reason for this wrong But that he was bound by a solemn oathA subtle traitor needs no sophisterCall Buckingham and bid him arm himselfCall Buckingham and all the friends thou hast I am resolv'd for death or dignityThe first I warrant thee if dreams prove trueYou were best to go to bed and dream again To keep thee from the tempest of the fieldI am resolv'd to bear a greater storm Than any thou canst conjure up today And that I'll write upon thy burgonet Might I but know thee by thy household badgeNow by my father's badge old Nevil's crest The rampant bear chain'd to the ragged staff This day I'll wear aloft my burgonet As on a mountaintop the cedar shows That keeps his leaves in spite of any storm Even to affright thee with the view thereofAnd from thy burgonet I'll rend thy bear And tread it under foot with all contempt Despite the berard that protects the bearAnd so to arms victorious father To quell the rebels and their complicesFie charity for shame Speak not in spite For you shall sup with Jesu Christ tonightFoul stigmatic that's more than thou canst tellIf not in heaven you'll surely sup in hellseverallySaint Albans Alarums to the battleClifford of Cumberland 'tis Warwick calls And if thou dost not hide thee from the bear Now when the angry trumpet sounds alarum And dead men's cries do fill the empty air Clifford I say come forth and fight with me Proud northern lord Clifford of Cumberland is hoarse with calling thee to arms How now my noble lord what all afootThe deadlyhanded Clifford slew my steed But match to match I have encount'red him And made a prey for carrion kites and crows Even of the bonny beast he lov'd so wellOf one or both of us the time is comeHold Warwick seek thee out some other chase For I myself must hunt this deer to deathThen nobly York 'tis for a crown thou fight'st As I intend Clifford to thrive today It grieves my soul to leave thee unassail'dWhat seest thou in me York Why dost thou pauseWith thy brave bearing should I be in love But that thou art so fast mine enemyNor should thy prowess want praise and esteem But that 'tis shown ignobly and in treasonSo let it help me now against thy sword As I in justice and true right express itMy soul and body on the action bothA dreadful lay Address thee instantlyThey fight and fallsLa fin couronne les oeuvresDiesThus war hath given thee peace for thou art still Peace with his soul heaven if it be thy willShame and confusion All is on the rout Fear frames disorder and disorder wounds Where it should guard O war thou son of hell Whom angry heavens do make their minister Throw in the frozen bosoms of our part Hot coals of vengeance Let no soldier fly He that is truly dedicate to war Hath no selflove nor he that loves himself Hath not essentially but by circumstance The name of valour Sees his father's body O let the vile world end And the premised flames of the last day Knit earth and heaven together Now let the general trumpet blow his blast Particularities and petty sounds To cease Wast thou ordain'd dear father To lose thy youth in peace and to achieve The silver livery of advised age And in thy reverence and thy chairdays thus To die in ruffian battle Even at this sight My heart is turn'd to stone and while 'tis mine It shall be stony York not our old men spares No more will I their babes Tears virginal Shall be to me even as the dew to fire And beauty that the tyrant oft reclaims Shall to my flaming wrath be oil and flax Henceforth I will not have to do with pity Meet I an infant of the house of York Into as many gobbets will I cut it As wild Medea young Absyrtus did In cruelty will I seek out my fame Come thou new ruin of old Clifford's house As did Aeneas old Anchises bear So bear I thee upon my manly shoulders But then Aeneas bare a living load Nothing so heavy as these woes of minewith the body and to fight is killedSo lie thou there For underneath an alehouse' paltry

Retreat and soldiers with drum and coloursOf Salisbury who can report of him That winter lion who in rage forgets Aged contusions and all brush of time And like a gallant in the brow of youth Repairs him with occasion This happy day Is not itself nor have we won one foot If Salisbury be lostMy noble father Three times today I holp him to his horse Three times bestrid him thrice I led him off Persuaded him from any further act But still where danger was still there I met him And like rich hangings in a homely house So was his will in his old feeble body But noble as he is look where he comes Now by my sword well hast thou fought today By th' mass so did we all I thank you Richard God knows how long it is I have to live And it hath pleas'd Him that three times today You have defended me from imminent death Well lords we have not got that which we have 'Tis not enough our foes are this time fled Being opposites of such repairing natureI know our safety is to follow them For as I hear the King is fled to London To call a present court of Parliament Let us pursue him ere the writs go forth What says Lord Warwick Shall we after themAfter them Nay before them if we can Now by my faith lords 'twas a glorious day Saint Albans' battle won by famous York Shall be eterniz'd in all age to come Sound drum and trumpets and to London all And more such days as these to us befall
