thee man I have a king's oath to the contrary Thou shalt be punish'd for thus frighting me For I am sick and capable of fears Oppress'd with wrongs and therefore full of fears A widow husbandless subject to fears A woman naturally born to fears And though thou now confess thou didst but jest With my vex'd spirits I cannot take a truce But they will quake and tremble all this day What dost thou mean by shaking of thy head Why dost thou look so sadly on my son What means that hand upon that breast of thine Why holds thine eye that lamentable rheum Like a proud river peering o'er his bounds Be these sad signs confirmers of thy words Then speak againnot all thy former tale But this one word whether thy tale be trueAs true as I believe you think them false That give you cause to prove my saying trueO if thou teach me to believe this sorrow Teach thou this sorrow how to make me die And let belief and life encounter so As doth the fury of two desperate men Which in the very meeting fall and die Lewis marry Blanch O boy then where art thou France friend with England what becomes of me Fellow be gone I cannot brook thy sight This news hath made thee a most ugly manWhat other harm have I good lady done But spoke the harm that is by others doneWhich harm within itself so heinous is As it makes harmful all that speak of itI do beseech you madam be contentIf thou that bid'st me be content wert grim Ugly and sland'rous to thy mother's womb Full of unpleasing blots and sightless stains Lame foolish crooked swart prodigious Patch'd with foul moles and eyeoffending marks I would not care I then would be content For then I should not love thee no nor thou Become thy great birth nor deserve a crown But thou art fair and at thy birth dear boy Nature and Fortune join'd to make thee great Of Nature's gifts thou mayst with lilies boast And with the halfblown rose but Fortune O She is corrupted chang'd and won from thee Sh' adulterates hourly with thine uncle John And with her golden hand hath pluck'd on France To tread down fair respect of sovereignty And made his majesty the bawd to theirs France is a bawd to Fortune and King John That strumpet Fortune that usurping John

kingsThou mayst thou shalt I will not go with thee I will instruct my sorrows to be proud For grief is proud and makes his owner stoop To me and to the state of my great grief Let kings assemble for my grief's so great That no supporter but the huge firm earth Can hold it up Seats herself on the ground Here I and sorrows sit Here is my throne bid kings come bow to it the and attendants'Tis true fair daughter and this blessed day Ever in France shall be kept festival To solemnize this day the glorious sun Stays in his course and plays the alchemist Turning with splendour of his precious eye The meagre cloddy earth to glittering gold The yearly course that brings this day about Shall never see it but a holiday RisingA wicked day and not a holy day What hath this day deserv'd what hath it done That it in golden letters should be set Among the high tides in the calendar Nay rather turn this day out of the week This day of shame oppression perjury Or if it must stand still let wives with child Pray that their burdens may not fall this day Lest that their hopes prodigiously be cross'd But on this day let seamen fear no wreck No bargains break that are not this day made This day all things begun come to ill end Yea faith itself to hollow falsehood changeBy heaven lady you shall have no cause To curse the fair proceedings of this day Have I not pawn'd to you my majestyYou have beguil'd me with a counterfeit Resembling majesty which being touch'd and tried Proves valueless you are forsworn forsworn You came in arms to spill mine enemies' blood But now in arms you strengthen it with yours The grappling vigour and rough frown of war Is cold in amity and painted peace And our oppression hath made up this league Arm arm you heavens against these perjur'd kings A widow cries Be husband to me heavens Let not the hours of this ungodly day Wear out the day in peace but ere sunset Set armed discord 'twixt these perjur'd kings Hear me O hear meLady Constance peaceWar war no peace Peace is to me a war O Lymoges O Austria thou dost shame That bloody spoil Thou slave thou wretch thou coward Thou little valiant great in villainy Thou ever strong upon the stronger side Thou Fortune's champion that dost never fight But when her humorous ladyship is by To teach thee safety Thou art perjur'd too And sooth'st up greatness What a fool art thou A ramping fool to brag and stamp and swear Upon my party Thou coldblooded slave Hast thou not spoke like thunder on my side Been sworn my soldier bidding me depend Upon thy stars thy fortune and thy strength And dost thou now fall over to my foes Thou wear a lion's hide Doff it for shame And hang a calf'sskin on those recreant limbsO that a man should speak those words to meAnd hang a calf'sskin on those recreant limbsThou dar'st not say so villain for thy lifeAnd hang a calf'sskin on those recreant limbsWe like not this thou dost forget thyselfHere comes the holy legate of the PopeHail you anointed deputies of heaven To thee King John my holy errand is I Pandulph of fair Milan cardinal And from Pope Innocent the legate here Do in his name religiously demand Why thou against the Church our holy mother So wilfully dost spurn and force perforce Keep Stephen Langton chosen Archbishop Of Canterbury from that holy see This in our foresaid holy father's name Pope Innocent I do demand of theeWhat earthly name to interrogatories Can task the free breath of a sacred king Thou canst not Cardinal devise a name So slight unworthy and ridiculous To charge me to an answer as the Pope Tell him this tale and from the mouth of England Add thus much more that no Italian priest Shall tithe or toll in our dominions But as we under heaven are supreme head So under Him that great supremacy Where we do reign we will alone uphold Without th' assistance of a mortal hand So tell the Pope all reverence set apart To him and his usurp'd authorityBrother of England you blaspheme in thisThough you and all the kings of Christendom Are led so grossly by this meddling priest Dreading the curse that money may buy out And by the merit of vile gold dross dust Purchase corrupted pardon of a man Who in that sale sells pardon from himself Though you and all the rest so grossly led This juggling witchcraft with revenue cherish Yet I alone alone do me oppose Against the Pope and count his friends my foesThen by the lawful power that I have Thou shalt stand curs'd and excommunicate And blessed shall he be that doth revolt From his allegiance to an heretic And meritorious shall that hand be call'd Canonized and worshipp'd as a saint That takes away by any secret course Thy hateful lifeO lawful let it be That I have room with Rome to curse awhile Good father Cardinal cry thou 'amen' To my keen curses for without my wrong There is no tongue hath power to curse him rightThere's law and warrant lady for my curseAnd for mine too when law can do no right Let it be lawful that law bar no wrong Law cannot give my child his kingdom here For he that holds his kingdom holds the law Therefore since law itself is perfect wrong How can the law forbid my tongue to cursePhilip of France on peril of a curse Let go the hand of that archheretic And raise the power of France upon his head Unless he do submit himself to RomeLook'st thou pale France Do not let go thy handLook to that devil lest that France repent And by disjoining hands hell lose a soulKing Philip listen to the CardinalAnd hang a calf'sskin on his recreant limbsWell ruffian I must pocket up these wrongs BecauseYour breeches best may carry themPhilip what say'st thou to the CardinalWhat should he say but as the CardinalBethink you father for the difference Is purchase of a heavy curse from Rome Or the light loss of England for a friend Forgo the easierThat's the curse of RomeO Lewis stand fast The devil tempts thee here In likeness of a new untrimmed brideThe Lady Constance speaks not from her faith But from her needO if thou grant my need Which only lives but by the death of faith That need must needs infer this principle That faith would live again by death of need O then tread down my need and faith mounts up Keep my need up and faith is trodden downThe King is mov'd and answers not to thisO be remov'd from him and answer wellDo so King Philip hang no more in doubtHang nothing but a calf'sskin most sweet loutI am perplex'd and know not what to sayWhat canst thou say but will perplex thee more If thou stand excommunicate and curs'dGood reverend father make my person yours And tell me how you would bestow yourself This royal hand and mine are newly knit And the conjunction of our inward souls Married in league coupled and link'd together With all religious strength of sacred vows The latest breath that gave the sound of words Was deepsworn faith peace amity true love Between our kingdoms and our royal selves And even before this truce but new before No longer than we well could wash our hands To clap this royal bargain up of peace Heaven knows they were besmear'd and overstain'd With slaughter's pencil where revenge did paint The fearful difference of incensed kings And shall these hands so lately purg'd of blood So newly join'd in love so strong in both Unyoke this seizure and this kind regreet Play fast and loose with faith so jest with heaven Make such unconstant children of ourselves As now again to snatch our palm from palm Unswear faith sworn and on the marriagebed Of smiling peace to march a bloody host And make a riot on the gentle brow Of true sincerity O holy sir My reverend father let it not be so Out of your grace devise ordain impose Some gentle order and then we shall be blest To do your pleasure and continue friendsAll form is formless order orderless Save what is opposite to England's love Therefore to arms be champion of our church Or let the church our mother breathe her curse A mother's curseon her revolting son France thou mayst hold a serpent by the tongue A chafed lion by the mortal paw A fasting tiger safer by the tooth Than keep in peace that hand which thou dost holdI may disjoin my hand but not my faithSo mak'st thou faith an enemy to faith And like a civil war set'st oath to oath Thy tongue against thy tongue O let thy vow First made to heaven first be to heaven perform'd That is to be the champion of our Church What since thou swor'st is sworn against thyself And may not be performed by thyself For that which thou hast sworn to do amiss Is not amiss when it is truly done And being not done where doing tends to ill The truth is then most done not doing it The better act of purposes mistook Is to mistake again though indirect Yet indirection thereby grows direct And falsehood cures as fire cools fire Within the scorched veins of one newburn'd It is religion that doth make vows kept But thou hast sworn against religion By what thou swear'st against the thing thou swear'st And mak'st an oath the surety for thy truth Against an oath the truth thou art unsure To swear swears only not to be forsworn Else what a mockery should it be to swear But thou dost swear only to be forsworn And most forsworn to keep what thou dost swear Therefore thy later vows against thy first Is in thyself rebellion to thyself And better conquest never canst thou make Than arm thy constant and thy nobler parts Against these giddy loose suggestions Upon which better part our pray'rs come in If thou vouchsafe them But if not then know The peril of our curses fight on thee So heavy as thou shalt not shake them off But in despair die under the black weightRebellion flat rebellionWill't not be Will not a calf'sskin stop that mouth of thineFather to armsUpon thy weddingday Against the blood that thou hast married What shall our feast be kept with slaughtered men Shall braying trumpets and loud churlish drums Clamours of hell be measures to our pomp O husband hear me ay alack how new Is 'husband' in my mouth even for that name Which till this time my tongue did ne'er pronounce Upon my knee I beg go not to arms Against mine uncleO upon my knee Made hard with kneeling I do pray to thee Thou virtuous Dauphin alter not the doom Forethought by heavenNow shall I see thy love What motive may Be stronger with thee than the name of wifeThat which upholdeth him that thee upholds His honour O thine honour Lewis thine honourI muse your Majesty doth seem so cold When such profound respects do pull you onI will denounce a curse upon his headThou shalt not need England I will fall from theeO fair return of banish'd majestyO foul revolt of French inconstancyFrance thou shalt rue this hour within this hourOld Time the clocksetter that bald sexton Time Is it as he will Well then France shall rueThe sun's o'ercast with blood Fair day adieu Which is the side that I must go withal I am with both each army hath a hand And in their rage I having hold of both They whirl asunder and dismember me Husband I cannot pray that thou mayst win Uncle I needs must pray that thou mayst lose Father I may not wish the fortune thine Grandam I will not wish thy wishes thrive Whoever wins on that side shall I lose Assured loss before the match

her creditor And with advantage means to pay thy love And my good friend thy voluntary oath Lives in this bosom dearly cherished Give me thy hand I had a thing to say But I will fit it with some better time By heaven Hubert I am almost asham'd To say what good respect I have of theeI am much bounden to your MajestyGood friend thou hast no cause to say so yet But thou shalt have and creep time ne'er so slow Yet it shall come for me to do thee good I had a thing to saybut let it go The sun is in the heaven and the proud day Attended with the pleasures of the world Is all too wanton and too full of gawds To give me audience If the midnight bell Did with his iron tongue and brazen mouth Sound on into the drowsy race of night If this same were a churchyard where we stand And thou possessed with a thousand wrongs Or if that surly spirit melancholy Had bak'd thy blood and made it heavythick Which else runs tickling up and down the veins Making that idiot laughter keep men's eyes And strain their cheeks to idle merriment A passion hateful to my purposes Or if that thou couldst see me without eyes Hear me without thine cars and make reply Without a tongue using conceit alone Without eyes ears and harmful sound of words Then in despite of brooded watchful day I would into thy bosom pour my thoughts But ah I will not Yet I love thee well And by my troth I think thou lov'st me wellSo well that what you bid me undertake Though that my death were adjunct to my act By heaven I would do itDo not I know thou wouldst Good Hubert Hubert Hubert throw thine eye On yon young boy I'll tell thee what my friend He is a very serpent in my way And wheresoe'er this foot of mine doth tread He lies before me Dost thou understand me Thou art his keeperAnd I'll keep him so That he shall not offend your MajestyDeathMy lordA graveHe shall not liveEnough I could be merry now Hubert I love thee Well I'll not say what I intend for thee Remember Madam fare you well I'll send those powers o'er to your MajestyMy blessing go with thee To For England cousin go Hubert shall be your man attend on you With all true duty On toward Calais ho France The 's camp and attendantsSo by a roaring tempest on the flood A whole armado of convicted sail Is scattered and disjoin'd from fellowshipCourage and comfort All shall yet go wellWhat can go well when we have run so ill Are we not beaten Is not Angiers lost Arthur ta'en prisoner Divers dear friends slain And bloody England into England gone O'erbearing interruption spite of Francehe hath won that hath he fortified So hot a speed with such advice dispos'd Such temperate order in so fierce a cause Doth want example who hath read or heard Of any kindred action like to thisWell could I bear that England had this praise So we could find some pattern of our shameLook who comes here a grave unto a soul Holding th' eternal spirit against her will In the vile prison of afflicted breath I prithee lady go away with meLo now now see the issue of your peacePatience good lady Comfort gentle ConstanceNo I defy all counsel all redress But that which ends all counsel true redress Death death O amiable lovely death Thou odoriferous stench sound rottenness Arise forth from the couch of lasting night Thou hate and terror to prosperity And I will kiss thy detestable bones And put my eyeballs in thy vaulty brows And ring these fingers with thy household worms And stop this gap of breath with fulsome dust And be a carrion monster like thyself Come grin on me and I will think thou smil'st And buss thee as thy wife Misery's love O come to meO fair affliction peaceNo no I will not having breath to cry O that my tongue were in the thunder's mouth Then with a passion would I shake the world And rouse from sleep that fell anatomy Which cannot hear a lady's feeble voice Which scorns a modern invocationLady you utter madness and not sorrowThou art not holy to belie me so I am not mad this hair I tear is mine My name is Constance I was Geffrey's wife Young Arthur is my son and he is lost I am not madI would to heaven I were For then 'tis like I should forget myself O if I could what grief should I forget Preach some philosophy to make me mad And thou shalt be canoniz'd Cardinal For being not mad but sensible of grief My reasonable part produces reason How I may be deliver'd of these woes And teaches me to kill or hang myself If I were mad I should forget my son Or madly think a babe of clouts were he I am not mad too well too well I feel The different plague of each calamityBind up those tresses O what love I note In the fair multitude of those her hairs Where but by a chance a silver drop hath fall'n Even to that drop ten thousand wiry friends Do glue themselves in sociable grief Like true inseparable faithful loves Sticking together in calamityTo England if you willBind up your hairsYes that I will and wherefore will I do it I tore them from their bonds and cried aloud 'O that these hands could so redeem my son As they have given these hairs their liberty' But now I envy at their liberty And will again commit them to their bonds Because my poor child is a prisoner And father Cardinal I have heard you say That we shall see and know our friends in heaven If that be true I shall see my boy again For since the birth of Cain the first male child To him that did but yesterday suspire There was not such a gracious creature born But now will canker sorrow eat my bud And chase the native beauty from his cheek And he will look as hollow as a ghost As dim and meagre as an ague's fit And so he'll die and rising so again When I shall meet him in the court of heaven I shall not know him Therefore never never Must I behold my pretty Arthur moreYou hold too heinous a respect of griefHe talks to me that never had a sonYou are as fond of grief as of your childGrief fills the room up of my absent child Lies in his bed walks up and down with me Puts on his pretty looks repeats his words Remembers me of all his gracious parts Stuffs out his vacant garments with his form Then have I reason to be fond of grief Fare you well had you such a loss as I I could give better comfort than you do I will not keep this form upon my headTearing her hair When there is such disorder in my wit O Lord my boy my Arthur my fair son My life my joy my food my ail the world My widowcomfort and my sorrows' cureI fear some outrage and I'll follow her There's nothing in this world can make me joy Life is as tedious as a twicetold tale Vexing the dull ear of a drowsy man And bitter shame hath spoil'd the sweet world's taste That it yields nought but shame and bitternessBefore the curing of a strong disease Even in the instant of repair and health The fit is strongest evils that take leave On their departure most of all show evil What have you lost by losing of this dayAll days of glory joy and happinessIf you had won it certainly you had No no when Fortune means to men most good She looks upon them with a threat'ning eye 'Tis strange to think how much King John hath lost In this which he accounts so clearly won Are not you griev'd that Arthur is his prisonerAs heartily as he is glad he hath himYour mind is all as youthful as your blood Now hear me speak with a prophetic spirit For even the breath of what I mean to speak Shall blow each dust each straw each little rub Out of the path which shall directly lead Thy foot to England's throne And therefore mark John hath seiz'd Arthur and it cannot be That whiles warm life plays in that infant's veins The misplac'd John should tain an hour One minute nay one quiet breath of rest A sceptre snatch'd with an unruly hand Must be boisterously maintain'd as gain'd And he that stands upon a slipp'ry place Makes nice of no vile hold to stay him up That John may stand then Arthur needs must fall So be it for it cannot be but soBut what shall I gain by young Arthur's fallYou in the right of Lady Blanch your wife May then make all the claim that Arthur didAnd lose it life and all as Arthur didHow green you are and fresh in this old world John lays you plots the times conspire with you For he that steeps his safety in true blood Shall find but bloody safety and untrue This act so evilly borne shall cool the hearts Of all his people and freeze up their zeal That none so small advantage shall step forth To check his reign but they will cherish it No natural exhalation in the sky No scope of nature no distemper'd day No common wind no customed event But they will pluck away his natural cause And call them meteors prodigies and signs Abortives presages and tongues of heaven Plainly denouncing vengeance upon JohnMay be he will not touch young Arthur's life But hold himself safe in his prisonmentO Sir when he shall hear of your approach If that young Arthur be not gone already Even at that news he dies and then the hearts Of all his people shall revolt from him And kiss the lips of unacquainted change And pick strong matter of revolt and wrath Out of the bloody fingers' ends of john Methinks I see this hurly all on foot And O what better matter breeds for you Than I have nam'd The bastard Faulconbridge Is now in England ransacking the Church Offending charity if but a dozen French Were there in arms they would be as a can To train ten thousand English to their side Or as a little snow tumbled about Anon becomes a mountain O noble Dauphin Go with me to the King 'Tis wonderful What may be wrought out of their discontent Now that their souls are topful of offence For England go I will whet on the KingStrong reasons makes strong actions Let us go If you say ay the King will not say no
