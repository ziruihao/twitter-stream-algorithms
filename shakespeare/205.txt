contrary the better for thy friendsNo sir the worseHow can that beMarry sir they praise me and make an ass of me Now my foes tell me plainly I am an ass so that by my foes sir I profit in the knowledge of myself and by my friends I am abused so that conclusions to be as kisses if your four negatives make your two affirmatives why then the worse for my friends and the better for my foesWhy this is excellentBy my troth sir no though it please you to be one of my friendsThou shalt not be the worse for me There's goldBut that it would be doubledealing sir I would you could make it anotherO

would not have you to think that my desire of having is the sin of covetousness But as you say sir let your bounty take a nap I will awake it anonand Here comes the man sir that did rescue meThat face of his I do remember well Yet when I saw it last it was besmear'd As black as Vulcan in the smoke of war A baubling vessel was he captain of For shallow draught and bulk unprizable With which such scathful grapple did he make With the most noble bottom of our fleet That very envy and the tongue of los Cried fame and honour on him What's the matterOrsino this is that Antonio That took the Phoenix and her fraught from Candy And this is he that did the Tiger board When your young nephew Titus lost his leg Here in the streets desperate of shame and state In private brabble did we apprehend himHe did me kindness sir drew on my side But in conclusion put strange speech upon me I know not what 'twas but distractionNotable pirate thou saltwater thief What foolish boldness brought thee to their mercies Whom thou in terms so bloody and so dear Hast made thine enemiesOrsino noble sir Be pleas'd that I shake off these names you give me Antonio never yet was thief or pirate Though I confess on base and ground enough Orsino's enemy A witchcraft drew me hither That most ingrateful boy there by your side From the rude sea's enrag'd and foamy mouth Did I redeem a wreck past hope he was His life I gave him and did thereto ad My love without retention or restraint All his in dedication for his sake Did I expose myself pure for his love Into the danger of this adverse town Drew to defend him when he was beset Where being apprehended his false cunning Not meaning to partake with me in danger Taught him to face me out of his acquaintance And grew a twenty years removed thing While one would wink denied me mine own purse Which I had recommended to his use Not half an hour beforeHow can this beWhen came he to this townToday my lord and for three months before No int'rim not a minute's vacancy Both day and night did we keep companyand Here comes the Countess now heaven walks on earth But for thee fellow fellow thy words are madness Three months this youth hath tended upon

nonregardance cast my faith And that I partly know the instrument That screws me from my true place in your favour Live you the marblebreasted tyrant still But this your minion whom I know you love And whom by heaven I swear I tender dearly Him will I tear out of that cruel eye Where he sits crowned in his master's spite Come boy with me my thoughts are ripe in mischief I'll sacrifice the lamb

extracting frenzy of mine own From my remembrance clearly banish'd his How does he sirrahTruly madam he holds Belzebub at the stave's end as well as a man in his case may do Has here writ a letter to you I should have given 't you today morning but as a madman's epistles are no gospels so it skills not much when they are deliver'dOpen't and read itLook then to be well edified when the fool delivers the madman Reads madly'By the Lord madam'How now Art thou madNo madam I do but read madness An your ladyship will have it as it ought to be you must allow voxPrithee read i' thy right witsSo I do madonna but to read his right wits is to read thus therefore perpend my Princess and give earToRead it you sirrahReads 'By the Lord madam you wrong me and the world shall know it Though you have put me into darkness and given your drunken cousin rule over me yet have I the benefit of my senses as well as your ladyship I have your own letter that induced me to the semblance I put on with the which I doubt not but to do myself much right or you much shame Think of me as you please I leave my duty a little unthought of and speak out of my injury 'D 'Did he write thisAy MadamThis savours not much of distractionSee him deliver'd Fabian bring him hitherMy lord so please you these things further thought on To think me as well a sister as a wife One day shall crown th' alliance on't so please you Here at my house and at my proper costMadam I am most apt t' embrace your offer ToYour master quits you and for your service done him So much against the mettle of your sex So far beneath your

How now MalvolioMadam you have done me wrong Notorious wrongHave I Malvolio NoLady you have Pray you peruse that letter You must not now deny it is your hand Write from it if you can in hand or phrase Or say 'tis not your seal not your invention You can say none of this Well grant it then And tell me in the modesty of honour Why you have given me such clear lights of favour Bade me come smiling and crossgarter'd to you To put on yellow stockings and to frown Upon Sir Toby and the lighter people And acting this in an obedient hope Why have you suffer'd me to be imprison'd Kept in a dark house visited by the priest And made the most notorious geck and gul That e'er invention play'd on Tell me whyAlas Malvolio this is not my writing Though I confess much like the character But out of question 'tis Maria's hand And now I do bethink me it was she First told me thou wast mad then cam'st in smiling And in such forms which here were presuppos'd Upon thee in the letter Prithee be content This practice hath most shrewdly pass'd upon thee But when we know the grounds and authors of it Thou shalt be both the plaintiff and the judge Of thine own causeGood madam hear me speak And let no quarrel nor no brawl to come Taint the condition of this present hour Which I have wond'red at In hope it shall not Most freely I confess myself and Toby Set this device against Malvolio here Upon some stubborn and uncourteous parts We had conceiv'd against him Maria writ The letter at Sir Toby's great importance In recompense whereof he hath married her How with a sportful malice it was follow'd May rather pluck on laughter than revenge If that the injuries be justly weigh'd That have on both sides pass'dAlas poor fool how have they baffl'd theeWhy ome are born great some achieve greatness and some have greatness thrown upon them' I was one sir in this interlude one Sir Topas sir but that's all one 'By the Lord fool I am not mad' But do you remember 'Madam why laugh you at such a barren rascal An you smile not he's gagg'd' And thus the whirligig of time brings in his revengesI'll be reveng'd on the whole pack of youHe hath been most notoriously abus'dPursue him and entreat him to a peace He hath not told us of the captain yet When that is known and golden time convents A solemn combination shall be made Of our dear souls Meantime sweet sister We will not part from hence Cesario come For so you shall be while you are a man But when in other habits you are seen Orsino's mistress and his fancy's queenall but thesingsWhen that I was and a little tiny boyWith hey ho the wind and the rainA foolish thing was but a toyFor the rain it raineth every dayBut when I came to man's estateWith hey ho the wind and the rain'Gainst knaves and thieves men shut their gateFor the rain it raineth every dayBut when I came alas to wiveWith hey ho the wind and the rainBy swaggering could I never thriveFor the rain it raineth every dayBut when I came unto my bedsWith hey ho the wind and the rainWith tosspots still had drunken headsFor the rain it raineth every dayA great while ago the world begunWith hey ho the wind and the rainBut that's all one our play is doneAnd we'll strive to please you every day
