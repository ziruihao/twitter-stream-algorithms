Rome A public placeandthe two Tribunes with othersNo I'll not go You hear what he hath said Which was sometime his general who lov'd him In a most dear particular He call'd me father But what o' that Go you that banish'd him A mile before his tent fall down and knee The way into his mercy Nay if he coy'd To hear Cominius speak I'll keep at homeHe would not seem to know meDo you hearYet one time he did call me by my name I urg'd our old acquaintance and the drops That we have bled together 'Coriolanus' He would not answer to forbid all names He was a kind of nothing titleless Till he had forg'd himself a name i' th' fire Of burning RomeWhy so You have made good work A pair of tribunes that have wrack'd for Rome To make coals cheap a noble memoryI minded him how royal 'twas to pardon When it was less expected he replied It was a bare petition of a state To one whom they had punish'dVery well Could he say lessI offer'd to awaken his regard For's private friends his answer to me was He could not stay to pick them in a pile Of noisome musty chaff He said 'twas folly For one poor grain or two to leave unburnt And still to nose th' offenceFor one poor grain or two I am one of those His mother wife his child And this brave fellow too we are the grains You are the musty chaff and you are smelt Above the moon We must be burnt for youNay pray be patient if you refuse your aid In this so neverneeded help yet do not Upbraid's with our distress But sure if you Would be your country's pleader your good tongue More than the instant army we can make Might stop our countrymanNo I'll not meddlePray you go to himWhat should I doOnly make trial what your love can do For Rome towards MarciusWell and say that Marcius Return me as Cominius is return'd Unheard what then But as a discontented friend griefshot With his unkindness Say't be soYet your good will Must have that thanks from Rome after the measure As you intended wellI'll undertake't I think he'll hear me Yet to bite his lip And hum at good Cominius much unhearts me He was not taken well he had not din'd The veins unfill'd our blood is cold and then We pout upon the morning are unapt To give or to forgive but when we have stuff'd These pipes and these conveyances of our blood With wine and feeding we have suppler souls Than in our priestlike fasts Therefore I'll watch him Till he be dieted to my request And then I'll set upon himYou know the very road into his kindness And cannot lose your wayGood faith I'll prove him Speed how it will I shall ere long have knowledge Of my successHe'll never hear himNotI tell you he does sit in gold his eye Red as 'twould burn Rome and his injury The gaoler to his pity I kneel'd before him 'Twas very faintly he said 'Rise' dismiss'd me Thus with his speechless hand What he would do He sent in writing after me what he would not Bound with an oath to yield to his conditions So that all hope is vain Unless his noble mother and his wife Who as I hear mean to solicit him For mercy to his country Therefore let's hence And with our fair entreaties haste them on The Volscian camp before Rometo the on guardStay Whence are youStand and go backYou guard like men 'tis well but by your leave I am an officer of state and come To speak with CoriolanusFrom whenceFrom Romemay not pass you must return Our general Will no more hear from thenceYou'll see your Rome embrac'd with fire before You'll speak with CoriolanusGood my friends If you have heard your general talk of Rome And of his friends there it is lots to blanks My name hath touch'd your ears it is MeneniusBe it so go back The virtue of your name Is not here passableI tell thee fellow Thy general is my lover I have been The book of his good acts whence men have read His fame unparallel'd haply amplified For I have ever verified my friends Of whom he's chief with all the size that verity Would without lapsing suffer Nay sometimes Like to a bowl upon a subtle ground I have tumbled past the throw and in his praise Have almost stamp'd the leasing therefore fellow I must have leave to passFaith sir if you had told as many lies in his behalf as you have uttered words in your own you should not pass here no though it were as virtuous to lie as to live chastely Therefore go backPrithee fellow remember my name is Menenius always factionary on the party of your generalHowsoever you have been his liar as you say you have I am one that telling true under him must say you cannot pass Therefore go backHas he din'd canst thou tell For I would not speak with him till after dinnerYou are a Roman are youI am as thy general isThen you should hate Rome as he does Can you when you have push'd out your gates the very defender of them and in a violent popular ignorance given your enemy your shield think to front his revenges with the easy groans of old women the virginal palms of your daughters or with the palsied intercession of such a decay'd dotant as you seem to be Can you think to blow out the intended fire your city is ready to flame in with such weak breath as this No you are deceiv'd therefore back to Rome and prepare for your execution You are condemn'd our general has sworn you out of reprieve and pardonSirrah if thy captain knew I were here he would use me with estimationCome my captain knows you notI mean thy generalMy general cares not for you Back I say go lest I let forth your half pint of blood Back that's the utmost of your having BackNay but fellow fellowwith What's the matterNow you companion I'll say an errand for you you shall know now that I am in estimation you shall perceive that a Jack guardant cannot office me from my son Coriolanus Guess but by my tainment with him if thou stand'st not i' th' state of hanging or of some death more long in spectatorship and crueller in suffering behold now presently and swoon for what's to come upon thee The glorious gods sit in hourly synod about thy particular prosperity and love thee no worse than thy old father Menenius does O my son my son thou art preparing fire for us look thee here's water to quench it I was hardly moved to come to thee but being assured none but myself could move thee I have been blown out of your gates with sighs and conjure thee to pardon Rome and thy petitionary countrymen The good gods assuage thy wrath and turn the dregs of it upon this varlet here this who like a block hath denied my access to theeAwayHow awayWife mother child I know not My affairs Are servanted to others Though I owe My revenge properly my remission lies In Volscian breasts That we have been familiar Ingrate forgetfulness shall poison rather Than pity note how much Therefore be gone Mine ears against your suits are stronger than Your gates against my force Yet for I lov'd thee Take this along I writ it for thy sake Gives a letter And would have sent it Another word Menenius I will not hear thee speak This man Aufidius Was my belov'd in Rome yet thou behold'stYou keep a constant temperAufidiusNow sir is your name Menenius'Tis a spell you see of much power You know the way home againDo you hear how we are shent for keeping your greatness backWhat cause do you think I have to swoonI neither care for th' world nor your general for such things as you I can scarce think there's any y'are so slight He that hath a will to die by himself fears it not from another Let your general do his worst For you be that you are long and your misery increase with your age I say to you as I was said to AwayA noble fellow I warrant himThe worthy fellow is our general he's the rock the oak not to be windshakenThe tent of and othersWe will before the walls of Rome tomorrow Set down our host My partner in this action You must report to th' Volscian lords how plainly I have borne this businessOnly their ends You have respected stopp'd your ears against The general suit of Rome never admitted A private whisper no not with such friends That thought them sure of youThis last old man Whom with crack'd heart I have sent to Rome Lov'd me above the measure of a father Nay godded me indeed Their latest refuge Was to send him for whose old love I have Though I show'd sourly to him once more offer'd The first conditions which they did refuse And cannot now accept To grace him only That thought he could do more a very little I have yielded to fresh embassies and suits Nor from the state nor private friends hereafter Will I lend ear toShout withinHa what shout is this Shall I be tempted to infringe my vow In the same time 'tis made I will not in mourning habitswith attendants My wife comes foremost then the honour'd mould Wherein this trunk was fram'd and in her hand The grandchild to her blood But out affection All bond and privilege of nature break Let it be virtuous to be obstinate What is that curtsy worth or those doves' eyes Which can make gods forsworn I melt and am not Of stronger earth than others My mother bows As if Olympus to a molehill should In supplication nod and my young boy Hath an aspect of intercession which Great nature cries 'Deny not' Let the Volsces Plough Rome and harrow Italy I'll never Be such a gosling to obey instinct but stand As if a man were author of himself And knew no other kinMy lord and husbandThese eyes are not the same I wore in RomeThe sorrow that delivers us thus chang'd Makes you think soLike a dull actor now I have forgot my part and I am out Even to a full disgrace Best of my flesh Forgive my tyranny but do not say For that 'Forgive our Romans' O a kiss Long as my exile sweet as my revenge Now by the jealous queen of heaven that kiss I carried from thee dear and my true lip Hath virgin'd it e'er since You gods I prate And the most noble mother of the world Leave unsaluted Sink my knee i' th' earth Kneels Of thy deep duty more impression show Than that of common sonsO stand up blest Whilst with no softer cushion than the flint I kneel before thee and unproperly Show duty as mistaken all this while Between the child and parent KneelsWhat's this Your knees to me to your corrected son Then let the pebbles on the hungry beach Fillip the stars then let the mutinous winds Strike the proud cedars 'gainst the fiery sun Murd'ring impossibility to make What cannot be slight workThou art my warrior I holp to frame thee Do you know this ladyThe noble sister of Publicola The moon of Rome chaste as the icicle That's curdied by the frost from purest snow And hangs on Dian's temple dear ValeriaThis is a poor epitome of yours Which by th' interpretation of full time May show like all yourselfThe god of soldiers With the consent of supreme Jove inform Thy thoughts with nobleness that thou mayst prove To shame unvulnerable and stick i' th' wars Like a great seamark standing every flaw And saving those that eye theeYour knee sirrahThat's my brave boyEven he your wife this lady and myself Are suitors to youI beseech you peace Or if you'd ask remember this before The thing I have forsworn to grant may never Be held by you denials Do not bid me Dismiss my soldiers or capitulate Again with Rome's mechanics Tell me not Wherein I seem unnatural desire not T'allay my rages and revenges with Your colder reasonsO no more no more You have said you will not grant us any thing For we have nothing else to ask but that Which you deny already yet we will ask That if you fail in our request the blame May hang upon your hardness therefore hear usAufidius and you Volsces mark for we'll Hear nought from Rome in private Your requestShould we be silent and not speak our raiment And state of bodies would bewray what life We have led since thy exile Think with thyself How more unfortunate than all living women Are we come hither since that thy sight which should Make our eyes flow with joy hearts dance with comforts Constrains them weep and shake with fear and sorrow Making the mother wife and child to see The son the husband and the father tearing His country's bowels out And to poor we Thine enmity's most capital thou bar'st us Our prayers to the gods which is a comfort That all but we enjoy For how can we Alas how can we for our country pray Whereto we are bound together with thy victory Whereto we are bound Alack or we must lose The country our dear nurse or else thy person Our comfort in the country We must find An evident calamity though we had Our wish which side should win for either thou Must as a foreign recreant be led With manacles through our streets or else Triumphantly tread on thy country's ruin And bear the palm for having bravely shed Thy wife and children's blood For myself son I purpose not to wait on fortune till These wars determine if I can not persuade thee Rather to show a noble grace to both parts Than seek the end of one thou shalt no sooner March to assault thy country than to tread Trust to't thou shalt not on thy mother's womb That brought thee to this worldAy and mine That brought you forth this boy to keep your name Living to time'A shall not tread on me I'll run away till I am bigger but then I'll fightNot of a woman's tenderness to be Requires nor child nor woman's face to see I have sat too longRisingNay go not from us thus If it were so that our request did tend To save the Romans thereby to destroy The Volsces whom you serve you might condemn us As poisonous of your honour No our suit Is that you reconcile them while the Volsces May say 'This mercy we have show'd' the Romans 'This we receiv'd' and each in either side Give the allhail to thee and cry 'Be blest For making up this peace' Thou know'st great son The end of war's uncertain but this certain That if thou conquer Rome the benefit Which thou shalt thereby reap is such a name Whose repetition will be dogg'd with curses Whose chronicle thus writ 'The man was noble But with his last attempt he wip'd it out Destroy'd his country and his name remains To th' ensuing age abhorr'd' Speak to me son Thou hast affected the fine strains of honour To imitate the graces of the gods To tear with thunder the wide cheeks o' th' air And yet to charge thy sulphur with a bolt That should but rive an oak Why dost not speak Think'st thou it honourable for a noble man Still to remember wrongs Daughter speak you He cares not for your weeping Speak thou boy Perhaps thy childishness will move him more Than can our reasons There's no man in the world More bound to's mother yet here he lets me prate Like one i' th' stocks Thou hast never in thy life Show'd thy dear mother any courtesy When she poor hen fond of no second brood Has cluck'd thee to the wars and safely home Loaden with honour Say my request's unjust And spurn me back but if it he not so Thou art not honest and the gods will plague thee That thou restrain'st from me the duty which To a mother's part belongs He turns away Down ladies let us shame him with our knees To his surname Coriolanus 'longs more pride Than pity to our prayers Down An end This is the last So we will home to Rome And die among our neighbours Nay behold's This boy that cannot tell what he would have But kneels and holds up hands for fellowship Does reason our petition with more strength Than thou hast to deny't Come let us go This fellow had a Volscian to his mother His wife is in Corioli and his child Like him by chance Yet give us our dispatch I am hush'd until our city be afire And then I'll speak a little He holds her by the hand silentO mother mother What have you done Behold the heavens do ope The gods look down and this unnatural scene They laugh at O my mother mother O You have won a happy victory to Rome But for your son believe it O believe it Most dangerously you have with him prevail'd If not most mortal to him But let it come Aufidius though I cannot make true wars I'll frame convenient peace Now good Aufidius Were you in my stead would you have heard A mother less or granted less AufidiusI was mov'd withalI dare be sworn you were And sir it is no little thing to make Mine eyes to sweat compassion But good sir What peace you'fl make advise me For my part I'll not to Rome I'll back with you and pray you Stand to me in this cause O mother wife AsideI am glad thou hast set thy mercy and thy honour At difference in thee Out of that I'll work Myself a former fortune To the ladiesAy by and by But we will drink together and you shall bear A better witness back than words which we On like conditions will have counterseal'd Comewith us Ladies you deserve To have a temple built you All the swords In Italy and her confederate arms Could not have made this peace Rome A public placeand See you yond coign o' th' Capitol yond cornerstoneWhy what of thatIf it be possible for you to displace it with your little finger there is some hope the ladies of Rome especially his mother may prevail with him But I say there is no hope in't our throats are sentenc'd and stay upon executionIs't possible that so short a time can alter the condition of a manThere is differency between a grub and a butterfly yet your butterfly was a grub This Marcius is grown from man to dragon he has wings he's more than a creeping thingHe lov'd his mother dearlySo did he me and he no more remembers his mother now than an eightyearold horse The tartness of his face sours ripe grapes when he walks he moves like an engine and the ground shrinks before his treading He is able to pierce a corslet with his eye talks like a knell and his hum is a battery He sits in his state as a thing made for Alexander What he bids be done is finish'd with his bidding He wants nothing of a god but eternity and a heaven to throne inYes mercy if you report him trulyI paint him in the character Mark what mercy his mother shall bring from him There is no more mercy in him than there is milk in a male tiger that shall our poor city find And all this is 'long of youThe gods be good unto usNo in such a case the gods will not be good unto us When we banish'd him we respected not them and he returning to break our necks they respect not us a Sir if you'd save your life fly to your house The plebeians have got your fellow tribune And hale him up and down all swearing if The Roman ladies bring not comfort home They'll give him death by inches another What's the newsGood news good news The ladies have prevail'd The Volscians are dislodg'd and Marcius gone A merrier day did never yet greet Rome No not th' expulsion of the TarquinsFriend Art thou certain this is true Is't most certainAs certain as I know the sun is fire Where have you lurk'd that you make doubt of it Ne'er through

mercenarySo he did my lord The army marvell'd at it and in the last When he had carried Rome and that we look'd For no less spoil than gloryThere was it For which my sinews shall be stretch'd upon him
