there's one above 'em yet I had thought They had parted so much honesty among 'em At least good mannersas not thus to suffer A man of his place and so near our favour To dance attendance on their lordships' pleasures And at the door too like a post with packets By holy Mary Butts there's knavery Let 'em alone and draw the curtain close We shall hear more anon The Council Chamber A Council table brought in with chairs and stools and placed under the state places himself at the upper end of the table on the left band a seat being left void above him as for Canterbury's seatseat themselves in order on each side at lower end as secretary at the doorSpeak to the business master secretary Why are we met in councilPlease your honours The chief cause concerns his Grace of CanterburyHas he had knowledge of itYesWho waits thereWithout my noble lordsYesMy Lord Archbishop And has done half an hour to know your pleasuresLet him come inYour Grace maynow approaches the Council tableMy good Lord Archbishop I am very sorry To sit here at this present and behold That chair stand empty but we all are men In our own natures frail and capable Of our flesh few are angels out of which frailty And want of wisdom you that best should teach us Have misdemean'd yourself and not a little Toward the King first then his laws in filling The whole realm by your teaching and your chaplains For so we are inform'dwith new opinions Divers and dangerous which are heresies And not reform'd may prove perniciousWhich reformation must be sudden too My noble lords for those that tame wild horses Pace 'em not in their hands to make 'em gentle But stop their mouth with stubborn bits and spur 'em Till they obey the manage If we suffer Out of our easiness and childish pity To one man's honour this contagious sickness Farewell all physic and what follows then Commotions uproars with a general taint Of the whole state as of late days our neighbours The upper Germany can dearly witness Yet freshly pitied in our memoriesMy good lords hitherto in all the progress Both of my life and office I have labour'd And with no little study that my teaching And the strong course of my authority Might go one way and safely and the end Was ever to do well Nor is there living I speak it with a single heart my lords A man that more detests more stirs against Both in his private conscience and his place Defacers of a public peace than I do Pray heaven the King may never find a heart With less allegiance in it Men that make Envy and crooked malice nourishment Dare bite the best I do beseech your lordships That in this case of justice my accusers Be what they will may stand forth face to face And freely urge against meNay my lord That cannot be you are a councillor And by that virtue no man dare accuse youMy lord because we have business of more moment We will be short with you 'Tis his Highness' pleasure And our consent for better trial of you From hence you be committed to the Tower Where being but a private man again You shall know many dare accuse you boldly More than I fear you are provided forAh my good Lord of Winchester I thank you You are always my good friend if your will pass I shall both find your lordship judge and juror You are so merciful I see your end 'Tis my undoing Love and meekness lord Become a churchman better than ambition Win straying souls with modesty again Cast none away That I shall clear myself Lay all the weight ye can upon my patience I make as little doubt as you do conscience In doing daily wrongs I could say more But reverence to your calling makes me modestMy lord my lord you are a sectary That's the plain truth Your painted gloss discovers To men that understand you words and weaknessMy Lord of Winchester y'are a little By your good favour too sharp men so noble However faulty yet should find respect For what they have been 'tis a cruelty To load a falling manGood Master Secretary I cry your honour mercy you may worst Of all this table say soWhy my lordDo not I know you for a favourer Of this new sect Ye are not soundNot soundNot sound I sayWould you were half so honest Men's prayers then would seek you not their fearsI shall remember this bold languageDo Remember your bold life tooThis is too much Forbear for shame my lordsI have doneAnd Then thus for you my lord it stands agreed I take it by all voices that forthwith You be convey'd to th' Tower a prisoner There to remain till the King's further pleasure Be known unto us Are you all agreed lordsWe areIs there no other way of mercy But I must needs to th' Tower my lordsWhat other Would you expect You are strangely troublesome Let some o' th' guard be ready there the guardFor me Must I go like a traitor thitherReceive him And see him safe i' th' TowerStay good my lords I have a little yet to say Look there my lords By virtue of that ring I take my cause Out of the gripes of cruel men and give it To a most noble judge the King my masterThis is the King's ring'Tis no counterfeit'Tis the right ring by heav'n I told ye all When we first put this dangerous stone arolling 'Twould fall upon ourselvesDo you think my lords The King will suffer but the little finger Of this man to be vex'd'Tis now too certain How much more is his life in value with him Would I were fairly out on'tMy mind gave me In seeking tales and informations Against this manwhose honesty the devil And his disciples only envy at Ye blew the fire that burns ye Now have at yethe frowning on them he takes his seatDread sovereign how much are we bound to heaven In daily thanks that gave us such a prince Not only good and wise but most religious One that in all obedience makes the church The chief aim of his honour and to strengthen That holy duty out of dear respect His royal self in judgment comes to hear The cause betwixt her and this great offenderYou were ever good at sudden commendations Bishop of Winchester But know I come not To hear such flattery now and in my presence They are too thin and bare to hide offences To me you cannot reach you play the spaniel And think with wagging of your tongue to win me But whatsoe'er thou tak'st me for I'm sure Thou hast a cruel nature and a bloody To Good man sit down Now let me see the proudest He that dares most but wag his finger at thee By all that's holy he had better starve Than but once think this place becomes thee notMay it please your GraceNo sir it does not please me I had thought I had had men of some understanding And wisdom of my Council but I find none Was it discretion lords to let this man This good manfew of you deserve that title This honest man wait like a lousy footboy At chamber door and one as great as you are Why what a shame was this Did my commission Bid ye so far forget yourselves I gave ye Power as he was a councillor to try him Not as a groom There's some of ye I see More out of malice than integrity Would try him to the utmost had ye mean Which ye shall never have while I liveThus far My most dread sovereign may it like your Grace To let my tongue excuse all What was purpos'd concerning his imprisonment was rather If there be faith in menmeant for his trial And fair purgation to the world than malice I'm sure in meWell well my lords respect him Take him and use him well he's worthy of it I will say thus much for him if a prince May be beholding to a subject Am for his love and service so to him Make me no more ado but all embrace him Be friends for shame my lords My Lord of Canterbury I have a suit which you must not deny me That is a fair young maid that yet wants baptism You must be godfather and answer for herThe greatest monarch now alive may glory In such an honour how may I deserve it That am a poor and humble subject to youCome come my lord you'd spare your spoons You shall have Two noble partners with you the old Duchess of Norfolk And Lady Marquis Dorset Will these please you Once more my Lord of Winchester I charge you Embrace and love this manWith a true heart And brotherlove I do itAnd let heaven Witness how dear I hold this confirmationGood man those joyful tears show thy true heart The common voice I see is verified Of thee which says thus 'Do my Lord of Canterbury A shrewd turn and he's your friend for ever' Come lords we trifle time away I long To have this young one made a Christian As I have made ye one lords one remain So I grow stronger you more honour gainThe palace yard Noise and tumult withinand his You'll leave your noise anon ye rascals Do you take the court for Paris garden Ye rude slaves leave your gaping Within Good master porter I belong to th' larderBelong to th' gallows and be hang'd ye rogue Is this a place to roar in Fetch me a dozen crabtree staves and strong ones these are but switches to 'em I'll scratch your heads You must be seeing christenings Do you look for ale and cakes here you rude rascalsPray sir be patient 'tis as much impossible Unless we sweep 'em from the door

in As much as one sound cudgel of four foot You see the poor remaindercould distribute I made no spare sirYou did nothing sirI am not Samson nor Sir Guy nor Colbrand To mow 'em down before me but if I spar'd any That had a head to hit either young or old He or she cuckold or cuckoldmaker Let me ne'er hope to see a chine again And that I would not for a cow God save herWithin Do you hear master porterI shall be with you presently good master puppy Keep the door close sirrahWhat would you have me doWhat should you do but knock 'em down by th' dozens Is this Moorfields to muster in Or have we some strange Indian with the great tool come to court the women so besiege us Bless me what a fry of fornication is at door On my Christian conscience this one christening will beget a thousand here will be father godfather and all togetherThe spoons will be the bigger sir There is a fellow somewhat near the door he should be a brazier by his face for o' my conscience twenty of the dogdays now reign in's nose all that stand about him are under the line they need no other penance That firedrake did I hit three times on the head and three times was his nose discharged against me he stands there like a mortarpiece to blow us There was a haberdasher's wife of small wit near him that rail'd upon me till her pink'd porringer fell off her head for kindling such a combustion in the state I miss'd the meteor once and hit that woman who cried out 'Clubs' when I might see from far some forty truncheoners draw to her succour which were the hope o' th' Strand where she was quartered They fell on I made good my place At length they came to th' broomstaff to me I defied 'em still when suddenly a file of boys behind 'em loose shot deliver'd such a show'r of pebbles that I was fain to draw mine honour in and let 'em win the work the devil was amongst 'em I think surelyThese are the youths that thunder at a playhouse and fight for bitten apples that no audience but the tribulation of Towerhill or the limbs of Limehouse their dear brothers are able to endure I have some of 'em in Limbo Patrum and there they are like to dance these three days besides the running banquet of two beadles that is to comethe Mercy o' me what a multitude are here They grow still too from all parts they are coming As if we kept a fair here Where are these porters These lazy knaves Y'have made a fine hand fellows There's a trim rabble let in are all these Your faithful friends o' th' suburbs We shall have Great store of room no doubt left for the ladies When they pass back from the christeningAn't please your honour We are but men and what so many may do Not being torn a pieces we have done An army cannot rule 'emAs I live If the King blame me for't I'll lay ye an By th' heels and suddenly and on your heads Clap round fines for neglect Y'are lazy knaves And here ye lie baiting of bombards when Ye should do service Hark the trumpets sound Th' are come already from the

close up or I'll make your head acheYou i' th' camlet get up o' th' rail I'll peck you o'er the pales else The palace sounding then two with his marshal's staff two Noblemen bearing great

This royal infantheaven still move about her Though in her cradle yet now promises Upon this land a thousand blessings Which time shall bring to ripeness She shall be But few now living can behold that goodness A pattern to all princes living with her And all that shall succeed Saba was never More covetous of wisdom and fair virtue Than this pure soul shall be All princely graces That mould up such a mighty piece as this is With all the virtues that attend the good Shall still be doubled on her Truth shall nurse her Holy and heavenly thoughts still counsel her She shall be lov'd and fear'd Her own shall bless her Her foes shake like a field of beaten corn And hang their heads with sorrow Good grows with her In her days every man shall eat in safety Under his own vine what he plants and sing The merry songs of peace to all his neighbours God shall be truly known and those about her From her shall read the perfect ways of honour And by those claim their greatness not by blood Nor shall this peace sleep with her but as when The bird of wonder dies the maiden phoenix Her ashes new create another heir As great in admiration as herself So shall she leave her blessedness to one When heaven shall call her from this cloud of darkness Who from the sacred ashes of her honour Shall starlike rise as great in fame as she was And so stand fix'd Peace plenty love truth terror That were the servants to this chosen infant Shall then be his and like a vine grow to him Wherever the bright sun of heaven shall shine His honour and the greatness of his name Shall be and make new

happiness of England An aged princess many days shall see her And yet no day without a deed to crown it Would I had known no more But she must die She must the saints must have heryet a virgin A most unspotted lily shall she pass To th' ground and all the world shall mourn herO Lord Archbishop Thou hast made me now a man never before This happy child did I get anything This oracle of comfort has so pleas'd me That when I am in heaven I shall desire To see what this child does and praise my Maker I thank ye all To you my good Lord Mayor And you good brethren I am much beholding I have receiv'd much honour by your presence And ye shall find me thankful Lead the way lords Ye must all see the Queen and she must thank ye She will be sick else This day no man think Has business at his house for all shall stay This little one shall make it holiday'Tis ten to one this play can never please All that are here Some come to take their ease And sleep an act or two but those we fear W'have frighted with our trumpets so 'tis clear They'll say 'tis nought others to hear the city Abus'd extremely and to cry 'That's witty' Which we have not done neither that I fear All the expected good w'are like to hear For this play at this time is only in The merciful construction of good women For such a one we show'd 'em If they smile And say 'twill do I know within a while All the best men are ours for 'tis ill hap If they hold when their ladies bid 'em clap
