personated I can write very like my lady your niece on forgotten matter we can hardly make distinction of our handsExcellent I smell a deviceI have't in my nose tooHe shall think by the letters that

'tis too late to go to bed now Come knight come knight Thepalace and Give me some music Now good morrow friends Now good Cesario but that piece of song That old and antique song we heard last night Methought it did relieve my passion much More than light airs and recollected terms Of these most brisk and giddypaced times Come but one verseHe is not here so please your lordship that should sing itWho was itFeste the jester my lord a fool that the Lady Olivia's father took much delight in He is about the houseSeek him out and play the tune the whileMusic plays Come hither boy If ever thou shalt love In the sweet pangs of it remember me For such as I am all true lovers are Unstaid and skittish in all motions else Save in the constant image of the creature That is belov'd How dost thou like this tuneIt gives a very echo to the seat Where Love is thron'dThou dost speak masterly My life upon't young though thou art thine eye Hath stay'd upon some favour that it loves Hath it not boyA little by your favourWhat kind of woman is'tOf your complexionShe is not worth thee then What years i' faithAbout your years my lordToo old by heaven Let still the woman take An elder than herself so wears she to him So sways she level in her husband's heart For boy however we do praise ourselves Our fancies are more giddy and unfirm More longing wavering sooner lost and won Than women's areI think it well my lordThen let thy love be younger than thyself Or thy affection cannot hold the bent For women are as roses whose fair flow'r Being once display'd doth fall that very hourAnd so they are alas that they are so To die even when they to perfection grow Re and O fellow come the song we had last night Mark it Cesario it is old and plain The spinsters and the knitters in the sun And the free maids that weave their thread with bones Do use to chant it it is silly sooth And dallies with the innocence of love Like the old ageAre you ready sirAy prithee sing MusicCome away come away death And in sad cypress let me be laid Fly away fly away breath I am slain by a fair cruel maid My shroud of white stuck all with yewO prepare it My part of death no one so trueDid share it Not a flower not a flower sweet On my black coffin let there be strown Not a friend not a friend greet My poor corpse where my bones shall be thrown A thousand thousand to saveLay me O where Sad true lover never find my graveTo weep thereThere's for thy painsNo pains sir I take pleasure in singing sirI'll pay thy pleasure thenTruly sir and pleasure will be paid one time or anotherGive me now leave to leave theeNow the melancholy god protect thee and the tailor make thy doublet of changeable taffeta for thy mind is a very opal I would have men of such constancy put to sea that their business might be everything and their intent everywhere for that's it that always makes a good voyage of nothing FarewellLet all the rest give placeOnce more Cesario Get thee to yond same sovereign cruelty Tell her my love more noble than the world Prizes not quantity of dirty lands The parts that fortune hath bestow'd upon her Tell her I hold as giddily as Fortune But 'tis that miracle and queen of gems That Nature pranks her in attracts my soulBut if she cannot love you sirI cannot be so answer'dSooth but you must Say that some lady as perhaps there is Hath for your love as great a pang of heart As you have for Olivia You cannot love her You tell her so Must she not then be answer'dThere is no woman's sides Can bide the beating of so strong a passion As love doth give my heart no woman's heart So big to hold so much they lack retention Alas their love may be call'd appetite No motion of the liver but the palate That suffer surfeit cloyment and revolt But mine is all as hungry as the sea And can digest as much Make no compare Between that love a woman can bear me And that I owe OliviaAy but I knowWhat dost thou knowToo well what love women to men may owe In faith they are as true of heart as we My father had a daughter lov'd a man As it might be perhaps were I a woman I should your lordshipAnd what's her historyA blank my lord She never told her love But let concealment like a worm i' th' bud Feed on her damask cheek She pin'd in thought And with a green and yellow melancholy She sat like Patience on a monument Smiling at grief Was not this love indeed We men may say more swear more but indeed Our shows are more than will for still we prove Much in our vows but little in our loveBut died thy sister of her love my boyI am all the daughters of my father's house And all the brothers too and yet I know not Sir shall I to this ladyAy that's the theme To her in haste Give her this jewel say My love can give no place bide no denaygardenand Come thy ways Signior FabianNay I'll come if I lose a scruple of this sport let me be boil'd to death with melancholyWouldst thou not be glad to have the niggardly rascally sheepbiter come by some notable shameI would exult man you know he brought me out o' favour with my lady about a bearbaiting hereTo anger him we'll have the bear again and we will fool him black and blue shall we not Sir AndrewAnd we do not it is pity of our lives Here comes the little villain How now my metal of IndiaGet ye all three into the boxtree Malvolio's coming down this walk He has been yonder i' the sun practising behaviour to his own shadow this half hour Observe him for the love of mockery for I know this letter will make a contemplative idiot of him Close in the name of jesting As the men hide she drops a letter Lie thou there for here comes the trout that must be caught with tickling'Tis but fortune all is fortune Maria once told me she did affect me and I have heard herself come thus near that should she fancy it should be one of my complexion Besides she uses me with a more exalted respect than any one else that follows her What should I think on'tHere's an overweening rogueO peace Contemplation makes a rare turkeycock of him how he jets under his advanc'd plumeslight I could so beat the roguePeace I sayTo be Count MalvolioAh roguePistol him pistol himPeace peaceThere is example for't the Lady of the Strachy married the yeoman of the wardrobeFie on him JezebelO peace Now he's deeply in look how imagination blows himHaving been three months married to her sitting in my stateO for a stonebow to hit him in the eyeCalling my officers about me in my branch'd velvet gown having come from a daybed where I have left Olivia sleepingFire and brimstoneO peace peaceAnd then to have the humour of state and after a demure travel of regard telling them I know my place as I would they should do theirs to ask for my kinsman TobyBolts and shacklesO peace peace peace Now nowSeven of my people with an obedient start make out for him I frown the while and perchance wind up my watch or play with my some rich jewel Toby approaches curtsies there to meShall this fellow liveThough our silence be drawn from us with cars yet peaceI extend my hand to him thus quenching my familiar smilewith an austere regard of controlAnd does not Toby take you a blow o' the lips thenSaying 'Cousin Toby my fortunes having cast me on your niece give me this prerogative of speech'What what'You must amend your drunkenness'Out scabNay patience or we break the sinews of our plot'Besides you waste the treasure of your time with a

not worthy to touch Fortune's fingers Farewell She that would alter services with thee' Daylight and champain discovers not more This is open I will be proud I will read politic authors I will baffle Sir Toby I will wash off gross acquaintance I will be pointdevise the very man I do not now fool myself to let imagination jade me for every reason excites to this that my lady loves me She did commend my yellow stockings of late she did praise my leg being crossgarter'd and in this she manifests herself to my love and with a kind of injunction drives me to these habits of her liking I thank my stars I am happy I will be strange stout in yellow stockings and crossgarter'd even with the swiftness of putting on Jove and my stars be praised Here is yet a postscript Reads 'Thou canst not

fruits of the sport mark his first approach before my lady He will come to her in yellow stockings and 'tis a colour she abhors and crossgarter'd a fashion she detests and he will smile upon her which will now be so unsuitable to her disposition being addicted to a melancholy as she is that it cannot but turn him into a notable contempt If you will see it follow meTo the gates of Tartar thou most
