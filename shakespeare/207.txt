 Verona Milan the frontiers of Mantua Verona An open placeand Cease to persuade my loving Proteus Homekeeping youth have ever homely wits Were't not affection chains thy tender days To the sweet glances of thy honour'd love I rather would entreat thy company To see the wonders of the world abroad Than living dully sluggardiz'd at home Wear out thy youth with shapeless idleness But since thou lov'st love still and thrive therein Even as I would when I to love beginWilt thou be gone Sweet Valentine adieu Think on thy Proteus when thou haply seest Some rare noteworthy object in thy travel Wish me partaker in thy happiness When thou dost meet good hap and in thy danger If ever danger do environ thee Commend thy grievance to my holy prayers For I will be thy headsman ValentineAnd on a lovebook pray for my successUpon some book I love I'll pray for theeThat's on some shallow story of deep love How young Leander cross'd the HellespontThat's a deep story of a deeper love For he was more than over shoes in love'Tis true for you are over boots in love And yet you never swum the HellespontOver the boots Nay give me not the bootsNo I will not for it boots thee notWhatTo be in love where scorn is bought with groans Coy looks with heartsore sighs one fading moment's mirth With twenty watchful weary tedious nights If haply won perhaps a hapless gain If lost why then a grievous labour won However but a folly bought with wit Or else a wit by folly vanquishedSo by your circumstance you call me foolSo by your circumstance I fear you'll prove'Tis love you cavil at I am not LoveLove is your master for he masters you And he that is so yoked by a fool Methinks should not be chronicled for wiseYet writers say as in the sweetest bud The eating canker dwells so eating love Inhabits in the finest wits of allAnd writers say as the most forward bud Is eaten by the canker ere it blow Even so by love the young and tender wit Is turn'd to folly blasting in the bud Losing his verdure even in the prime And all the fair effects of future hopes But wherefore waste I time to counsel the That art a votary to fond desire Once more adieu My father at the road Expects my coming there to see me shipp'dAnd thither will I bring thee ValentineSweet Proteus no now let us take our leave To Milan let me hear from thee by letters Of thy success in love and what news else Betideth here in absence of thy friend And I likewise will visit thee with mineAll happiness bechance to thee in MilanAs much to you at home and so farewellHe after honour hunts I after love He leaves his friends to dignify them more I leave myself my friends and all for love Thou Julia thou hast metamorphis'd me Made me neglect my studies lose my time War with good counsel set the world at nought Made wit with musing weak heart sick with thought Sir Proteus save you Saw you my masterBut now he parted hence to embark for MilanTwenty to one then he is shipp'd already And I have play'd the sheep in losing himIndeed a sheep doth very often stray An if the shepherd be awhile awayYou conclude that my master is a shepherd then and I a sheepI doWhy then my horns are his horns whether I wake or sleepA silly answer and fitting well a sheepThis proves me still a sheepTrue and thy master a shepherdNay that I can deny by a circumstanceIt shall go hard but I'll prove it by anotherThe shepherd seeks the sheep and not the sheep the shepherd but I seek my master and my master seeks not me therefore I am no sheepThe sheep for fodder follow the shepherd the shepherd for food follows not the sheep thou for wages followest thy master thy master for wages follows not thee Therefore thou art a sheepSuch another proof will make me cry 'baa'But dost thou hear Gav'st thou my letter to JuliaAy sir I a lost mutton gave your letter to her a lac'd mutton and she a lac'd mutton gave me a lost mutton nothing for my labourHere's too small a pasture for such store of muttonsIf the ground be overcharg'd you were best stick herNay in that you are astray 'twere best pound youNay sir less than a pound shall serve me for carrying your letterYou mistake I mean the pound a pinfoldFrom a pound to a pin Fold it over and over 'Tis threefold too little for carrying a letter to your loverBut what said she NoddingAyNod ay Why that's 'noddy'You mistook sir I say she did nod and you ask me if she did nod and I say 'Ay'And that set together is 'noddy'Now you have taken the pains to set it together take it for your painsNo no you shall have it for bearing the letterWell I perceive I must be fain to bear with youWhy sir how do you bear with meMarry sir the letter very orderly having nothing but the word 'noddy' for my painsBeshrew me but you have a quick witAnd yet it cannot overtake your slow purseCome come open the matter in brief what said sheOpen your purse that the money and the matter may be both at once deliveredWell sir here is for your pains What said sheTruly sir I think you'll hardly win herWhy couldst thou perceive so much from herSir I could perceive nothing at all from her no not so much as a ducat for delivering your letter and being so hard to me that brought your mind I fear she'll prove as hard to you in telling your mind Give her no token but stones for she's as hard as steelWhat said she NothingNo not so much as 'Take this for thy pains' To testify your bounty I thank you you have testern'd me in requital whereof henceforth carry your letters yourself and so sir I'll commend you to my masterGo go be gone to save your ship from wreck Which cannot perish having thee aboard Being destin'd to a drier death on shore I must go send some better messenger I fear my Julia would not deign my lines Receiving them from such a worthless postVerona The garden Ofhouseand But say Lucetta now we are alone Wouldst thou then counsel me to fall in loveAy madam so you stumble not unheedfullyOf all the fair resort of gentlemen That every day with parle encounter me In thy opinion which is worthiest lovePlease you repeat their names I'll show my mind According to my shallow simple skillWhat think'st thou of the fair Sir EglamourAs of a knight wellspoken neat and fine But were I you he never should be mineWhat think'st thou of the rich MercatioWell of his wealth but of himself so soWhat think'st thou of the gentle ProteusLord Lord to see what folly reigns in usHow now what means this passion at his namePardon dear madam 'tis a passing shame That I unworthy body as I am Should censure thus on lovely gentlemenWhy not on Proteus as of all the restThen thus of many good I think him bestYour reasonI have no other but a woman's reason I think him so because I think him soAnd wouldst thou have me cast my love on himAy if you thought your love not cast awayWhy he of all the rest hath never mov'd meYet he of all the rest I think best loves yeHis little speaking shows his love but smallFire that's closest kept burns most of allThey do not love that do not show their loveO they love least that let men know their loveI would I knew his mindPeruse this paper madam'To Julia' Say from whomThat the contents will showSay say who gave it theeSir Valentine's page and sent I think from Proteus He would have given it you but I being in the way Did in your name receive it pardon the fault I prayNow by my modesty a goodly broker Dare you presume to harbour wanton lines To whisper and conspire against my youth Now trust me 'tis an office of great worth And you an officer fit for the place There take the paper see it be return'd Or else return no more into my sightTo plead for love deserves more fee than hateWill ye be goneThat you may ruminate And yet I would I had o'erlook'd the letter It were a shame to call her back again And pray her to a fault for which I chid her What fool is she that knows I am a maid And would not force the letter to my view Since maids in modesty say 'No' to that Which they would have the profferer construe 'Ay' Fie fie how wayward is this foolish love That like a testy babe will scratch the nurse And presently all humbled kiss the rod How churlishly I chid Lucetta hence When willingly I would have had her here How angerly I taught my brow to frown When inward joy enforc'd my heart to smile My penance is to call Lucetta back And ask remission for my folly past What ho LucettaRe What would your ladyshipIs't near dinner timeI would it were That you might kill your stomach on your meat And not upon your maidWhat is't that you took up so gingerlyNothingWhy didst thou stoop thenTo take a paper up that I let fallAnd is that paper nothingNothing concerning meThen let it lie for those that it concernsMadam it will not lie where it concerns Unless it have a false interpreterSome love of yours hath writ to you in rhymeThat I might sing it madam to a tune Give me a note your ladyship can setAs little by such toys as may be possible Best sing it to the tune of 'Light o' Love'It is too heavy for so light a tuneHeavy belike it hath some burden thenAy and melodious were it would you sing itAnd why not youI cannot reach so highLet's see your song withholds the letter How now minionKeep tune there still so you will sing it out And yet methinks I do not like this tuneYou do notNo madam 'tis too sharpYou minion are too saucyNay now you are too flat And mar the concord with too harsh a descant There wanteth but a mean to fill your songThe mean is drown'd with your unruly bassIndeed I bid the base for ProteusThis babble shall not henceforth trouble me Here is a coil with protestation Tears the letter Go get you gone and let the papers lie You would be fing'ring them to anger meShe makes it strange but she would be best pleas'd To be so ang'red with another letter Nay would I were so ang'red with the same O hateful hands to tear such loving words Injurious wasps to feed on such sweet honey And kill the bees that yield it with your stings I'll kiss each several paper for amends Look here is writ 'kind Julia' Unkind Julia As in revenge of thy ingratitude I throw thy name against the bruising stones Trampling contemptuously on thy disdain And here is writ 'lovewounded Proteus' Poor wounded name my bosomas a bed Shall lodge thee till thy wound be throughly heal'd And thus I search it with a sovereign kiss But twice or thrice was 'Proteus' written down Be calm good wind blow not a word away Till I have found each letter in the letter Except mine own name that some whirlwind bear Unto a ragged fearful hanging rock And throw it thence into the raging sea Lo here in one line is his name twice writ 'Poor forlorn Proteus passionate Proteus To the sweet Julia' That I'll tear away And yet I will not sith so prettily He couples it to his complaining names Thus will I fold them one upon another Now kiss embrace contend do what you will Re Madam Dinner is ready and your father staysWell let us goWhat shall these papers lie like telltales hereIf you respect them best to take them upNay I was taken up for laying them down Yet here they shall not lie for catching coldI see you have a month's mind to themAy madam you may say what sights you see I see things too although you judge I winkCome come will't please you goVeronahouseand Tell me Panthino what sad talk was that Wherewith my brother held you in the cloister'Twas of his nephew Proteus your sonWhy what of himHe wond'red that your lordship Would suffer him to spend his youth at home While other men of slender reputation Put forth their sons to seek preferment out Some to the wars to try their fortune there Some to discover islands far away Some to the studious universities For any or for all these exercises He said that Proteus your son was meet And did request me to importune you To let him spend his time no more at home Which would be great impeachment to his age In having known no travel in his youthNor need'st thou much importune me to that Whereon this month I have been hammering I have consider'd well his loss of time And how he cannot be a perfect man Not being tried and tutor'd in the world Experience is by industry achiev'd And perfected by the swift course of time Then tell me whither were I best to send himI think your lordship is not ignorant How his companion youthful Valentine Attends the Emperor in his royal courtI know it well'Twere good I think your lordship sent him thither There shall he practise tilts and tournaments Hear sweet discourse converse with noblemen And be in eye of every exercise Worthy his youth and nobleness of birthI like thy counsel well hast thou advis'd And that thou mayst perceive how well I like it The execution of it shall make known Even with the speediest expedition I will dispatch him to the Emperor's courtTomorrow may it please you Don Alphonso With other gentlemen of good esteem Are journeying to salute the Emperor And to commend their service to his willGood company with them shall Proteus go And in good time now will we break with himSweet love sweet lines sweet life Here is her hand the agent of her heart Here is her oath for love her honour's pawn O that our fathers would applaud our loves To seal our happiness with their consents O heavenly JuliaHow now What letter are you reading thereMay't please your lordship 'tis a word or two Of commendations sent from Valentine Deliver'd by a friend that came from himLend me the letter let me see what newsThere is no news my lord but that he writes How happily he lives how wellbelov'd And daily graced by the Emperor Wishing me with him partner of his fortuneAnd how stand you affected to his wishAs one relying on your lordship's will And not depending on his friendly wishMy will is something sorted with his wish Muse not that I thus suddenly proceed For what I will I will and there an end I am resolv'd that thou shalt spend some time With Valentinus in the Emperor's court What maintenance he from his friends receives Like exhibition thou shalt have from me Tomorrow be in readiness to go Excuse it not for I am peremptoryMy lord I cannot be so soon provided Please you deliberate a day or twoLook what thou want'st shall be sent after thee No more of stay tomorrow thou must go Come on Panthino you shall be employ'd To hasten on his expedition Thus have I shunn'd the fire for fear of burning And drench'd me in the sea where I am drown'd I fear'd to show my father Julia's letter Lest he should take exceptions to my love And with the vantage of mine own excuse Hath he excepted most against my love O how this spring of love resembleth The uncertain glory of an April day Which now shows all the beauty of the sun And by an by a cloud takes all awayRe Sir Proteus your father calls for you He is in haste therefore I pray you goWhy this it is my heart accords thereto And yet a thousand times it answers 'No'
