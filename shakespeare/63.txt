 England and FranceThe First Part of King Henry the Sixth Westminster Abbey Dead Marchthe funeral ofattended on by the Regent of France the Protector the the theHung be the heavens with black yield day to night Comets importing change of times and states Brandish your crystal tresses in the sky And with them scourge the bad revolting stars That have consented unto Henry's death King Henry the Fifth too famous to live long England ne'er lost a king of so much worthEngland ne'er had a king until his time Virtue he had deserving to command His brandish'd sword did blind men with his beams His arms spread wider than a dragon's wings His sparkling eyes replete with wrathful fire More dazzled and drove back his enemies Than midday sun fierce bent against their faces What should I say His deeds exceed all speech He ne'er lift up his hand but conqueredWe mourn in black why mourn we not in blood Henry is dead and never shall revive Upon a wooden coffin we attend And death's dishonourable victory We with our stately presence glorify Like captives bound to a triumphant car What shall we curse the planets of mishap That plotted thus our glory's overthrow Or shall we think the subtlewitted French Conjurers and sorcerers that afraid of him By magic verses have contriv'd his endHe was a king bless'd of the King of kings Unto the French the dreadful judgmentday So dreadful will not be as was his sight The battles of the Lord of Hosts he fought The Church's prayers made him so prosperousThe Church Where is it Had not churchmen pray'd His thread of life had not so soon decay'd None do you like but an effeminate prince Whom like a schoolboy you may overaweGloucester whate'er we like thou art Protector And lookest to command the Prince and realm Thy wife is proud she holdeth thee in awe More than God or religious churchmen mayName not religion for thou lov'st the flesh And ne'er throughout the year to church thou go'st Except it be to pray against thy foesCease cease these jars and rest your minds in peace Let's to the altar Heralds wait on us Instead of gold we'll offer up our arms Since arms avail not now that Henry's dead Posterity await for wretched years When at their mothers' moist'ned eyes babes shall suck Our isle be made a nourish of salt tears And none but women left to wail the dead the Fifth thy ghost I invocate Prosper this realm keep it from civil broils Combat with adverse planets in the heavens A far more glorious star thy soul will make Than Julius Caesar or brighta My honourable lords health to you all Sad tidings bring I to you out of France Of loss of slaughter and discomfiture Guienne Champagne Rheims Orleans Paris Guysors Poictiers are all quite lostWhat say'st thou man before dead Henry's corse Speak softly or the loss of those great towns Will make him burst his lead and rise from deathIs Paris lost Is Rouen yielded up If Henry were recall'd to life again These news would cause him once more yield the ghostHow were they lost What treachery was us'dNo treachery but want of men and money Amongst the soldiers this is muttered That here you maintain several factions And whilst a field should be dispatch'd and fought You are disputing of your generals One would have ling'ring wars with little cost Another would fly swift but wanteth wings A third thinks without expense at all By guileful fair words peace may be obtain'd Awake awake English nobility Let not sloth dim your honours newbegot Cropp'd are the flowerdeluces in your arms Of England's coat one half is cut awayWere our tears wanting to this funeral These tidings would call forth their flowing tidesMe they concern Regent I am of France Give me my steeled coat I'll fight for France Away with these disgraceful wailing robes Wounds will I lend the French instead of eyes To weep their intermissive miseries a second Lords view these letters full of bad mischance France is revolted from the English quite Except some petty towns of no import The Dauphin Charles is crowned king in Rheims The Bastard of Orleans with him is join'd Reignier Duke of Anjou doth take his part The Duke of Alencon flieth to his sideThe Dauphin crowned king all fly to him O whither shall we fly from this reproachWe will not fly but to our enemies' throats Bedford if thou be slack I'll fight it outGloucester why doubt'st thou of my forwardness An army have I muster'd in my thoughts Wherewith already France is overrun a third My gracious lords to add to your laments Wherewith you now bedew King Henry's hearse I must inform you of a dismal fight Betwixt the stout Lord Talbot and the FrenchWhat Wherein Talbot overcame Is't soO no wherein Lord Talbot was o'erthrown The circumstance I'll tell you more at large The tenth of August last this dreadful lord Retiring from the siege of Orleans Having full scarce six thousand in his troop By three and twenty thousand of the French Was round encompassed and set upon No leisure had he to enrank his men He wanted pikes to set before his archers Instead whereof sharp stakes pluck'd out of hedges They pitched in the ground confusedly To keep the horsemen off from breaking in More than three hours the fight continued Where valiant Talbot above human thought Enacted wonders with his sword and lance Hundreds he sent to hell and none durst stand him Here there and everywhere enrag'd he slew The French exclaim'd the devil was in arms All the whole army stood agaz'd on him His soldiers spying his undaunted spirit 'A Talbot a Talbot' cried out amain And rush'd into the bowels of the battle Here had the conquest fully been seal'd up If Sir John Fastolfe had not play'd the coward He being in the vaward plac'd behind With purpose to relieve and follow them Cowardly fled not having struck one stroke Hence grew the general wreck and massacre Enclosed were they with their enemies A base Walloon to win the Dauphin's grace Thrust Talbot with a spear into the back Whom all France with their chief assembled strength Durst not presume to look once in the faceIs Talbot slain Then I will slay myself For living idly here in pomp and ease Whilst such a worthy leader wanting aid Unto his dastard foemen is betray'dO no he lives but is took prisoner And Lord Scales with him and Lord Hungerford Most of the rest slaughter'd or took likewiseHis ransom there is none but I shall pay I'll hale the Dauphin headlong from his throne His crown shall be the ransom of my friend Four of their lords I'll change for one of ours Farewell my masters to my task will I Bonfires in France forthwith I am to make To keep our great Saint George's feast withal Ten thousand soldiers with me I will take Whose bloody deeds shall make an Europe quakeSo you had need for Orleans is besieg'd The English army is grown weak and faint The Earl of Salisbury craveth supply And hardly keeps his men from mutiny Since they so few watch such a multitudeRemember lords your oaths to Henry sworn Either to quell the Dauphin utterly Or bring him in obedience to your yokeI do remember it and here take my leave To go about my preparation I'll to the Tower with all the haste I can To view th' artillery and munition And then I will proclaim young Henry kingTo Eltham will I where the young King is Being ordain'd his special governor And for his safety there I'll best devise AsideEach hath his place and function to attend I am left out for me nothing remains But long I will not be Jack out of office The King from Eltham I intend to steal And sit at chiefest stern of public wealFrance Before Orleans Sound a flourish andmarching with drum and soldiersMars his true moving even as in the heavens So in the earth to this day is not known Late did he shine upon the English side Now we are victors upon us he smiles What towns of any moment but we have At pleasure here we lie near Orleans Otherwhiles the famish'd English like pale ghosts Faintly besiege us one hour in a monthThey want their porridge and their fat bull beeves Either they must be dieted like mules And have their provender tied to their mouths Or piteous they will look like drowned miceLet's raise the siege Why live we idly here Talbot is taken whom we wont to fear Remaineth none but madbrain'd Salisbury And he may well in fretting spend his gall Nor men nor money hath he to make warSound sound alarum we will rush on them Now for the honour of the forlorn French Him I forgive my death that killeth me When he sees me go back one foot or flee Here alarum They are beaten hack by the English withgreat loss Re and Who ever saw the like What men have I Dogs cowards dastards I would ne'er have fled But that they left me midst my enemiesSalisbury is a desperate homicide He fighteth as one weary of his life The other lords like lions wanting food Do rush upon us as their hungry preyFroissart a countryman of ours records England all Olivers and Rowlands bred During the time Edward the Third did reign More truly now may this be verified For none but Samsons and Goliases It sendeth forth to skirmish One to ten Lean rawbon'd rascals Who would e'er suppose They had such courage and audacityLet's leave this town for they are harebrain'd slaves And hunger will enforce them to be more eager Of old I know them rather with their teeth The walls they'll tear down than forsake the siegeI think by some odd gimmers or device Their arms are set like clocks still to strike on Else ne'er could they hold out so as they do By my consent we'll even let them aloneBe it so theWhere's the Prince Dauphin I have news for himBastard

To shine on my contemptible estate Lo whilst I waited on my tender lambs And to sun's parching heat display'd my cheeks God's Mother deigned to appear to me And in a vision full of majesty Will'd me to leave my base vocation And free my country from calamity Her aid she promis'd and assur'd success In complete glory she reveal'd herself And whereas I was black and swart before With those clear rays which she infus'd on me That beauty am I bless'd with which you may see Ask me what question thou canst possible And I will answer unpremeditated My courage try by combat if thou dar'st And thou shalt find that I exceed my sex Resolve on this thou shalt be fortunate If thou receive me for thy warlike mateThou hast astonish'd me with thy high terms Only this proof I'll of thy valour make In

the English have the suburbs wonFather I know and oft have shot at them Howe'er unfortunate I miss'd my aimBut now thou shalt not Be thou rul'd by me Chief mastergunner am I of this town Something I must do to procure me grace The Prince's espials have informed me How the English in the suburbs close intrench'd Wont through a secret grate of iron bars In yonder tower to overpeer the city And thence discover how with most advantage They may vex us with shot or with assault To intercept this inconvenience A piece of ordnance 'gainst it I have plac'd And even these three days have I watch'd If I could see them Now do thou watch For I can stay no longer If thou spy'st any run and bring me word And thou shalt find me at the Governor's Father I warrant you take you no care I'll never trouble you if I may spy themand on the turrets with and othersTalbot my life my joy again return'd How wert thou handled being prisoner Or by what means got'st thou to be releas'd Discourse I prithee on this turret's topThe Earl of Bedford had a prisoner Call'd the brave Lord Ponton de Santrailles For him was I exchang'd and ransomed But with a baser man of arms by far Once in contempt they would have barter'd me Which I disdaining scorn'd and craved death Rather than I would be so vile esteem'd In fine redeem'd I was as I desir'd But O the treacherous Fastolfe wounds my heart Whom with my bare fists I would execute If I now had him brought into my powerYet tell'st thou not how thou wert tain'dWith scoffs and scorns and contumelious taunts In open marketplace produc'd they me To be a public spectacle to all Here said they is the terror of the French The scarecrow that affrights our children so Then broke I from the officers that led me And with my nails digg'd stones out of the ground To hurl at the beholders of my shame My grisly countenance made others fly None durst come near for fear of sudden death In iron walls they deem'd me not secure So great fear of my name 'mongst them was spread That they suppos'd I could rend bars of steel And spurn in pieces posts of adamant Wherefore a guard of chosen shot I had That walk'd about me every minutewhile And if I did but stir out of my bed Ready they were to shoot me to the heartthe with a linstockI grieve to hear what torments you endur'd But we will be reveng'd sufficiently Now it is suppertime in Orleans Here through this grate I count each one And view the Frenchmen how they fortify Let us look in the sight will much delight thee Sir Thomas Gargrave and Sir William Glansdale Let me have your express opinions Where is best place to make our batt'ry nextI think at the North Gate for there stand lordsAnd I here at the bulwark of the bridgeFor aught I see this city must be famish'd Or with light skirmishes enfeebledHere they shoot and andfall downO Lord have mercy on us wretched sinnersO Lord have mercy on me woeful manWhat chance is this that suddenly hath cross'd us Speak Salisbury at least if thou canst speak How far'st thou mirror of all martial men One of thy eyes and thy cheek's side struck off Accursed tower accursed fatal hand That hath contriv'd this woeful tragedy In thirteen battles Salisbury o'ercame Henry the Fifth he first train'd to the wars Whilst any trump did sound or drum struck up His sword did ne'er leave striking in the field Yet liv'st thou Salisbury Though thy speech doth fail One eye thou hast to look to heaven for grace The sun with one eye vieweth all the world Heaven be thou gracious to none alive If Salisbury wants mercy at thy hands Bear hence his body I will help to bury it Sir Thomas Gargrave hast thou any life Speak unto Talbot nay look up to him Salisbury cheer thy spirit with this comfort Thou shalt not die whiles He beckons with his hand and smiles on me As who should say 'When I am dead and gone Remember to avenge me on the French' Plantagenet I will and like thee Nero Play on the lute beholding the towns burn Wretched shall France be only in my name Here an alarum and it thunders and lightens What stir is this What tumult's in the heavens Whence cometh this alarum and the noisea My lord my lord the French have gather'd head The Dauphin with one Joan la Pucelle join'd A holy prophetess new risen up Is come with a great power to raise the siege Here lifteth himself up and groansHear hear how dying Salisbury doth groan It irks his heart he cannot be reveng'd Frenchmen I'll be a Salisbury to you Pucelle or puzzel dolphin or dogfish Your hearts I'll stamp out with my horse's heels And make a quagmire of your mingled brains Convey me Salisbury into his tent And then we'll try what these dastard Frenchmen dare Alarum Before OrleansHere an alarum again and pursueth the and driveth him Then driving Englishmen before her ThenWhere is my strength my valour and my force Our English troops retire I cannot stay them A woman clad in armour chaseth themHere here she comes I'll have a bout with thee Devil or devil's dam I'll conjure thee Blood will I draw on theethou art a witch And straightway give thy soul to him thou serv'stCome come 'tis only I that must disgrace theeHere they fightHeavens can you suffer hell so to prevail My breast I'll burst with straining of my courage And from my shoulders crack my arms asunder But I will chastise this high minded strumpet They fight againTalbot farewell thy hour is not yet come I must go victual Orleans forthwithA short alarum thenthe town with soldiers O'ertake me if thou canst I scorn thy strength Go go cheer up thy hungry starved men Help Salisbury to make his testament This day is ours as many more shall beMy thoughts are whirled like a potter's wheel I know not where I am nor what I do A witch by fear not force like Hannibal Drives back our troops and conquers as she lists So bees with smoke and doves with noisome stench Are from their hives and houses driven away They call'd us for our fierceness English dogs Now like to whelps we crying run away A short alarum Hark countrymen Either renew the fight Or tear the lions out of England's coat Renounce your soil give sheep in lions' stead Sheep run not half so treacherous from the wolf Or horse or oxen from the leopard As you fly from your oft subdued slavesAlarum Here another skirmish It will not beretire into your trenches You all consented unto Salisbury's death For none would strike a stroke in his revenge Pucelle is ent'red into Orleans In spite of us or aught that we could do O would I were to die with Salisbury The shame hereof will make me hide my head Alarum retreat Flourishon the wallsand soldiersAdvance our waving colours on the walls Rescu'd is Orleans from the English Thus Joan la Pucelle hath perform'd her wordDivinest creature Astraea's daughter How shall I honour thee for this success Thy promises are like Adonis' gardens That one day bloom'd and fruitful were the next France triumph in thy glorious prophetess Recover'd is the town of Orleans More blessed hap did ne'er befall our stateWhy ring not out the bells aloud throughout the town Dauphin command the citizens make bonfires And feast and banquet in the open streets To celebrate the joy that God hath given usAll France will be replete with mirth and joy When they shall hear how we have play'd the men'Tis Joan not we by whom the day is won For which I will divide my crown with her And all the priests and friars in my realm Shall in procession sing her endless praise A statelier pyramis to her I'll rear Than Rhodope's of Memphis ever was In memory of her when she is dead Her ashes in an urn more precious Than the rich jewel'd coffer of Darius Transported shall be at high festivals Before the kings and queens of France No longer on Saint Denis will we cry But Joan la Pucelle shall be France's saint Come in and let us banquet royally After this golden day of victory Flourish
