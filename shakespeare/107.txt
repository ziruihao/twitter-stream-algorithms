The parkthe with three attending ladies and two other Now madam summon up your dearest spirits Consider who the King your father sends To whom he sends and what's his embassy Yourself held precious in the world's esteem To parley with the sole inheritor Of all perfections that a man may owe Matchless Navarre the plea of no less weight Than Aquitaine a dowry for a queen Be now as prodigal of all dear grace As Nature was in making graces dear When she did starve the general world beside And prodigally gave them all to you Good Lord Boyet my beauty though but mean Needs not the painted flourish of your praise Beauty is bought by judgment of the eye Not utt'red by base sale of chapmen's tongues I am less proud to hear you tell my worth Than you much willing to be counted wise In spending your wit in the praise of mine But now to task the tasker good Boyet You are not ignorant alltelling fame Doth noise abroad Navarre hath made a vow Till painful study shall outwear three years No woman may

one Know you the manI know him madam at a marriage feast Between Lord Perigort and the beauteous heir Of Jaques Falconbridge solemnized In Normandy saw I this Longaville A man of sovereign parts peerless esteem'd Well fitted in arts glorious in arms Nothing becomes him ill that he would well The only soil of his fair virtue's gloss If virtue's gloss will stain with any soil Is a sharp wit match'd with too blunt a will Whose edge hath power to cut whose will still wills It should none spare that come within his power Some merry mocking lord belike is't soThey say so most that most his humours know Such shortliv'd wits do wither as they grow Who are the restThe young Dumain a wellaccomplish'd youth Of all that virtue love for virtue loved Most power to do most harm least knowing ill For he hath wit to make an ill shape good And shape to win grace though he had no wit I saw him at the Duke Alencon's once And much too little of that good I saw Is my report to his great worthinessAnother of these students at that time Was there with him if I have heard a truth Berowne they call him but a merrier man Within the limit of becoming mirth I never spent an hour's talk withal His eye begets occasion for his wit For every object that the one doth catch The other turns to a mirthmoving jest Which his fair tongue conceit's expositor Delivers in such apt and gracious words That aged ears play truant at his tales And younger hearings are quite ravished So sweet and voluble is his discourse God bless my ladies Are they all in love That every one her own hath garnished With such bedecking ornaments of praiseHere comes BoyetReNow what admittance lordNavarre had notice of your fair approach And he and his competitors in oath Were all address'd to meet you

several they beBelonging to whomTo my fortunes and me Good wits will be jangling but gentles agree This civil war of wits were much better used On Navarre and his bookmen for here 'tis abusedIf my observation which very seldom lies By the heart's still rhetoric disclosed with eyes Deceive me not now Navarre is infected With whatWith that which we lovers entitle 'affected' Your reasonWhy all his behaviours did make their retire To the court of his eye peeping thorough desire His heart like an agate with your print impressed Proud with his form in his eye pride expressed His tongue all impatient to speak and not see Did stumble with haste in his eyesight to be All senses to that sense did make their repair To feel only looking on fairest of fair Methought all his senses were lock'd in his eye As jewels in crystal for some prince to buy Who tend'ring their own worth from where they were glass'd Did point you to buy them along as you pass'd His face's own margent did quote such amazes That all eyes saw his eyes enchanted with gazes I'll give you Aquitaine and all that is his An you give him for my sake but one loving kiss Come to our pavilion Boyet is dispos'dBut to speak that in words which his eye hath disclos'd I only have made a mouth of his eye By adding a tongue which I know will not lieThou art an old lovemonger and speakest skilfullyHe is Cupid's grandfather and learns news of himThen was Venus like her mother for her father is but grimDo you hear my mad wenchesNoWhat then do you seeAy our way to be goneYou are too hard for me
