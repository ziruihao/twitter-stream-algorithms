 Now tain conjecture of a time When creeping murmur and the poring dark Fills the wide vessel of the universe From camp to camp through the foul womb of night The hum of either army stilly sounds That the fix'd sentinels almost receive The secret whispers of each other's watch Fire answers fire and through their paly flames Each battle sees the other's umber'd face Steed threatens steed in high and boastful neighs Piercing the night's dull ear and from the tents The armourers accomplishing the knights With busy hammers closing rivets up Give dreadful note of preparation The country cocks do crow the clocks do ton And the third hour of drowsy morning name Proud of their numbers and secure in soul The confident and overlusty French Do the lowrated English play at dice And chide the cripple tardygaited night Who like a foul and ugly witch doth limp So tediously away The poor condemned English Like sacrifices by their watchful fires Sit patiently and inly ruminate The morning's danger and their gesture sad Investing lanklean cheeks and warworn coats Presenteth them unto the gazing moon So many horrid ghosts O now who will behold The royal captain of this ruin'd band Walking from watch to watch from tent to tent Let him cry 'Praise and glory on his head' For forth he goes and visits all his host Bids them good morrow with a modest smile And calls them brothers friends and countrymen Upon his royal face there is no note How dread an army hath enrounded him Nor doth he dedicate one jot of colour Unto the weary and allwatched night But freshly looks and overbears attaint With cheerful semblance and sweet majesty That every wretch pining and pale before Beholding him plucks comfort from his looks A largess universal like the sun His liberal eye doth give to every one Thawing cold fear that mean and gentle all Behold as may unworthiness define A little touch of Harry in the night And so our scene must to the battle fly Where O for pity we shall much disgrace With four or five most vile and ragged foils Right illdispos'd in brawl ridiculous The name of Agincourt Yet sit and see Minding true things by what their mock'ries be France The English camp at Agincourtthe and Gloucester 'tis true that we are in great danger The greater therefore should our courage be Good morrow brother Bedford God Almighty There is some soul of goodness in things evil Would men observingly distil it out For our bad neighbour makes us early stirrers Which is both healthful and good husbandry Besides they are our outward consciences And preachers to us all admonishing That we should dress us fairly for our end Thus may we gather honey from the weed And make a moral of the devil himself Good morrow old Sir Thomas Erpingham A good soft pillow for that good white head Were better than a churlish turf of FranceNot so my liege this lodging likes me better Since I may say 'Now lie I like a king''Tis good for men to love their present pains Upon example so the spirit is eased And when the mind is quick'ned out of doubt The organs though defunct and dead before Break up their drowsy grave and newly move With casted slough and fresh legerity Lend me thy cloak Sir Thomas Brothers both Commend me to the princes in our camp Do my good morrow to them and anon Desire them all to my pavilionWe shall my liegeShall I attend your GraceNo my good knight Go with my brothers to my lords of England I and my bosom must debate awhile And then I would no other companyThe Lord in heaven bless thee noble Harry all but the Godamercy old heart thou speak'st cheerfullyQui va laA friendDiscuss unto me art thou officer Or art thou base common and popularI am a gentleman of a companyTrail'st thou the puissant pikeEven so What are youAs good a gentleman as the EmperorThen you are a better than the KingThe King's a bawcock and a heart of gold A lad of life an imp of fame Of parents good of fist most valiant I kiss his dirty shoe and from heartstring I love the lovely bully What is thy nameHarry le RoyLe Roy a Cornish name art thou of Cornish crewNo I am a WelshmanKnow'st thou FluellenYesTell him I'll knock his leek about his pate Upon Saint Davy's dayDo not you wear your dagger in your cap that day lest he knock that about yoursArt thou his friendAnd his kinsman tooThe figo for thee thenI thank you God be with youMy name is Pistol call'd It sorts well with your fiercenessand Captain FluellenSo in the name of Jesu Christ speak fewer It is the greatest admiration in the universal world when the true and aunchient prerogatifes and laws of the wars is not kept if you would take the pains but to examine the wars of Pompey the Great you shall find I warrant you that there is no tiddletaddle nor pibblepabble in Pompey's camp I warrant you you shall find the ceremonies of the wars and the cares of it and the forms of it and the sobriety of it and the modesty of it to be otherwiseWhy the enemy is loud you hear him all nightIf the enemy is an ass and a fool and a prating coxcomb is it meet think you that we should also look you be an ass and a fool and a prating coxcomb In your own conscience nowI will speak lowerI pray you and beseech you that you will Though it appear a little out of fashion There is much care and valour in this Welshmanthree soldiersand Brother John Bates is not that the morning which breaks yonderI think it be but we have no great cause to desire the approach of dayWe see yonder the beginning of the day but I think we shall never see the end of it Who goes thereA friendUnder what captain serve youUnder Sir Thomas ErpinghamA good old commander and a most kind gentleman I pray you what thinks he of our estateEven as men wreck'd upon a sand that look to be wash'd off the next tideHe hath not told his thought to the KingNo nor it is not meet he should For though I speak it to you I think the King is but a man as I am the violet smells to him as it doth to me the element shows to him as it doth to me all his senses have but human conditions his ceremonies laid by in his nakedness he appears but a man and though his affections are higher mounted than ours yet when they stoop they stoop with the like wing Therefore when he sees reason of fears as we do his fears out of doubt be of the same relish as ours are yet in reason no man should possess him with any appearance of fear lest he by showing it should dishearten his armyHe may show what outward courage he will but I believe as cold a night as 'tis he could wish himself in Thames up to the neck and so I would he were and I by him at all adventures so we were quit hereBy my troth I will speak my conscience of the King I think he would not wish himself anywhere but where he isThen I would he were here alone so should he be sure to be ransomed and a many poor men's lives savedI dare say you love him not so ill to wish him here alone howsoever you speak this to feel other men's minds methinks I could not die anywhere so contented as in the King's company his cause being just and his quarrel honourableThat's more than we knowAy or more than we should seek after for we know enough if we know we are the King's subjects If his cause be wrong our obedience to the King wipes the crime of it out of usBut if the cause be not good the King himself hath a heavy reckoning to make when all those legs and arms and heads chopp'd off in a battle shall join together at the latter day and cry all 'We died at such a place' some swearing some crying for a surgeon some upon their wives left poor behind them some upon the debts they owe some upon their children rawly left I am afeard there are few die well that die in a battle for how can they charitably dispose of anything when blood is their argument Now if these men do not die well it will be a black matter for the King that led them to it who to disobey were against all proportion of subjectionSo if a son that is by his father sent about merchandise do sinfully miscarry upon the sea the imputation of his wickedness by your rule should be imposed upon his father that sent him or if a servant under his master's command transporting a sum of money be assailed by robbers and die in many irreconcil'd iniquities you may call the business of the master the author of the servant's damnation But this is not so the King is not bound to answer the particular endings of his soldiers the father of his son nor the master of his servant for they purpose not their death when they purpose their services Besides there is no king be his cause never so spotless if it come to the arbitrement of swords can try it out with all unspotted soldiers some peradventure have on them the guilt of premeditated and contrived murder some of beguiling virgins with the broken seals of perjury some making the wars their bulwark that have before gored the gentle bosom of peace with pillage and robbery Now if these men have defeated the law and outrun native punishment though they can outstrip men they have no wings to fly from God war is His beadle war is His vengeance so that here men are punish'd for beforebreach of the King's laws in now the King's quarrel Where they feared the death they have borne life away and where they would be safe they perish Then if they die unprovided no more is the King guilty of their damnation than he was before guilty of those impieties for the which they are now visited Every subject's duty is the King's but every subject's soul is his own Therefore should every soldier in the wars do as every sick man in his bed wash every mote out of his conscience and dying so death is to him advantage or not dying the time was blessedly lost wherein such preparation was gained and in him that escapes it were not sin to think that making God so free an offer He let him outlive that day to see His greatness and to teach others how they should prepare'Tis certain every man that dies ill the ill upon his own head the King is not to answer for itI do not desire he should answer for me and yet I determine to fight lustily for himI myself heard the King say he would not be ransom'dAy he said so to make us fight cheerfully but when our throats are cut he may be ransom'd and we ne'er the wiserIf I live to see it I will never trust his word afterYou pay him then That's a perilous shot out of an eldergun that a poor and a private displeasure can do against a monarch You may as well go about to turn the sun to ice with fanning in his face with a peacock's feather You'll never trust his word after Come 'tis a foolish sayingYour reproof is something too round I should be angry with you if the time were convenientLet it be a quarrel between us if you liveI embrace itHow shall I know thee againGive me any gage of thine and I will wear it in my bonnet then if ever thou dar'st acknowledge it I will make it my quarrelHere's my glove give me another of thineThereThis will I also wear in my cap if ever thou come to me and say after tomorrow 'This is my glove' by this hand I will take thee a box on the earIf ever I live to see it I will challenge itThou dar'st as well be hang'dWell I will do it though I take thee in the King's companyKeep thy word Fare thee wellBe friends you English fools be friends we have French quarrels enow if you could tell how to reckonIndeed the French may lay twenty French crowns to one they will beat us for they bear them on their shoulders but it is no English treason to cut French crowns and tomorrow the King himself will be a clipper soldiers Upon the King Let us our lives our souls Our debts our careful wives Our children and our sins lay on the King We must bear all O hard condition Twinborn with greatness subject to the breath Of every fool whose sense no more can feel But his own wringing What infinite heart's ease Must kings neglect that private men enjoy And what have kings that privates have not too Save ceremony save general ceremony And what art thou thou idol Ceremony What kind of god art thou that suffer'st more Of mortal griefs than do thy worshippers What are thy rents What are thy comingsin O Ceremony show me but thy worth What is thy soul of adoration Art thou aught else but place degree and form Creating awe and fear in other men Wherein thou art less happy being fear'd Than they in fearing What drink'st thou oft instead of homage sweet But poison'd flattery O be sick great greatness And bid thy ceremony give thee cure Thinks thou the fiery fever will go out With titles blown from adulation Will it give place to flexure and low bending Canst thou when thou command'st the beggar's knee Command the health of it No thou proud dream That play'st so subtly with a king's repose I am a king that find thee and I know 'Tis not the balm the sceptre and the ball The sword the mace the crown imperial The intertissued robe of gold and pearl The farced tide running fore the king The throne he sits on nor the tide of pomp That beats upon the high shore of this world No not all these thrice gorgeous ceremony Not all these laid in bed majestical Can sleep so soundly as the wretched slave Who with a body fill'd and vacant mind Gets him to rest cramm'd with distressful bread Never sees horrid night the child of hell But like a lackey from the rise to set Sweats in the eye of Pheebus and all night Sleeps in Elysium next day after dawn Doth rise and help Hyperion to his horse And follows so the everrunning year With profitable labour to his grave And but for ceremony such a wretch Winding up days with toil and nights with sleep Had the forehand and vantage of a king The slave a member of the country's peace Enjoys it but in gross brain little wots What watch the king keeps to maintain the peace Whose hours the peasant best advantages My lord your nobles jealous of your absence Seek through your camp to find youGood old knight Collect them all together at my tent I'll be before theeI shall do't my lord O God of battles steel my soldiers' hearts Possess them not with fear Take from them now The sense of reck'ning if th' opposed numbers Pluck their hearts from them Not today O Lord O not today think not upon the fault My father made in compassing the crown I Richard's body have interred new And on it have bestowed more contrite tears Than from it issued forced drops of blood Five hundred poor I have in yearly pay Who twice a day their wither'd hands hold up Toward heaven to pardon blood and I have built Two chantries where the sad and solemn priests Sing still for Richard's soul More will I do Though all that I can do is nothing worth Since that my penitence comes after all Imploring pardon My liegeMy brother Gloucester's voice Ay I know thy errand I will go with thee The day my friends and all things stay for me The French camptheand othersThe sun doth gild our armour up my lordsMontez a cheval My horse Varlet laquais HaO brave spiritVia Les eaux et la terreRien puis L'air et le feuCiel cousin Orleans Now my Lord ConstableHark how our steeds for present service neighMount them and make incision in their hides That their hot blood may spin in English eyes And dout them with superfluous courage haWhat will you have them weep our horses' blood How shall we then behold their natural tearsa The English are embattl'd you French peersTo horse you gallant Princes straight to horse Do but behold yon poor and starved band And your fair show shall suck away their souls Leaving them but the shales and husks of men There is not work enough for all our hands Scarce blood enough in all their sickly veins To give each naked curtleaxe a stain That our French gallants shall today draw out And sheathe for lack of sport Let us but blow on them The vapour of our valour will o'erturn them 'Tis positive 'gainst all exceptions lords That our superfluous lackeys and our peasants Who in unnecessary action swarm About our squares of battle were enow To purge this field of such a hilding foe Though we upon this mountain's basis by Took stand for idle speculation But that our honours must not What's to say A very little little let us do And all is done Then let the trumpets sound The tucket sonance and the note to mount For our approach shall so much dare the field That England shall couch down in fear and yieldWhy do you stay so long my lords of France Yond island carrions desperate of their bones Illfavouredly become the morning field Their ragged curtains poorly are let loose And our air shakes them passing scornfully Big Mars seems bankrupt in their beggar'd host And faintly through a rusty beaver peeps The horsemen sit like fixed candlesticks With torchstaves in their hand and their poor jades Lob down their heads dropping the hides and hips The gum downroping from their paledead eyes And in their pale dull mouths the gimmal'd bit Lies foul with chaw'd grass still and motionless And their executors the knavish crows Fly o'er them all impatient for their hour Description cannot suit itself in words To demonstrate the life of such a battle In life so lifeless as it shows itselfThey have said their prayers and they stay for deathShall we go send them dinners and fresh suits And give their fasting horses provender And after fight with themI stay but for my guidon To the field I will the banner from a trumpet take And use it for my haste Come come away The sun is high and we outwear the dayThe English campwith all his host and Where is the KingThe King himself is rode to view their battleOf fighting men they have full threescore thousandThere's five to one besides they all are freshGod's arm strike with us 'tis a fearful odds God bye you Princes all I'll to my charge If we no more meet till we meet in heaven Then joyfully my noble Lord of Bedford My dear Lord Gloucester and my good Lord Exeter And my kind kinsman warriors all adieuFarewell good Salisbury and good luck go with theeFarewell kind lord Fight valiantly today And yet I do thee wrong to mind thee of it For thou art fram'd of the firm truth of valourHe is as full of valour as of kindness Princely in boththe O that we now had here But one ten thousand of those men in England That do no work todayWhat's he that wishes so My cousin Westmoreland No my fair cousin If we are mark'd to die we are enow To do our country loss and if to live The fewer men the greater share of honour God's will I pray thee wish not one man more By Jove I am not covetous for gold Nor care I who doth feed upon my cost It yearns me not if men my garments wear Such outward things dwell not in my desires But if it be a sin to covet honour I am the most offending soul alive No faith my coz wish not a man from England God's peace I would not lose so great an honour As one man more methinks would share from me For the best hope I have O do not wish one more Rather proclaim it Westmoreland through my host That he which hath no stomach to this fight Let him depart his passport shall be made And crowns for convoy put into his purse We would not die in that man's company That fears his fellowship to die with us This day is call'd the feast of Crispian He that outlives this day and comes safe home Will stand a tiptoe when this day is nam'd And rouse him at the name of Crispian He that shall live this day and see old age Will yearly on the vigil feast his neighbours And say 'Tomorrow is Saint Crispian' Then will he strip his sleeve and show his scars And say 'These wounds I had on Crispian's day' Old men forget yet all shall be forgot But he'll remember with advantages What feats he did that day Then shall our names Familiar in his mouth as household words Harry the King Bedford and Exeter Warwick and Talbot Salisbury and Gloucester Be in their flowing cups freshly rememb'red This story shall the good man teach his son And Crispin Crispian shall ne'er go by From this day to the ending of the world But we in it shall be remembered We few we happy few we band of brothers For he today that sheds his blood with me Shall be my brother be he ne'er so vile This day shall gentle his condition And gentlemen in England nowabed Shall think themselves accurs'd they were not here And hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaks That fought with us upon Saint Crispin's day Re My sovereign lord bestow yourself with speed The French are bravely in their battles set And will with all expedience charge on usAll things are ready if our minds be soPerish the man whose mind is backward nowThou dost not wish more help from England cozGod's will my liege would you and I alone Without more help could fight this royal battleWhy now thou hast unwish'd five thousand men Which likes me better than to wish us one You know your places God be with you allTucketOnce more I come to know of thee King Harry If for thy ransom thou wilt now compound Before thy most assured overthrow For certainly thou art so near the gulf Thou needs must be englutted Besides in mercy The constable desires thee thou wilt mind Thy followers of repentance that their souls May make a peaceful and a sweet retire From off these fields where wretches their poor bodies Must lie and festerWho hath sent thee nowThe Constable of FranceI pray thee bear my former answer back Bid them achieve me and then sell my bones Good God why should they mock poor fellows thus The man that once did sell the lion's skin While the beast liv'd was kill'd with hunting him A many of our bodies shall no doubt Find native graves upon the which I trust Shall witness live in brass of this day's work And those that leave their valiant bones in France Dying like men though buried in your dunghills They shall be fam'd for there the sun shall greet them And draw their honours reeking up to heaven Leaving their earthly parts to choke your clime The smell whereof shall breed a plague in France Mark then abounding valour in our English That being dead like to the bullet's grazing Break out into a second course of mischief Killing in relapse of mortality Let me speak proudly tell the Constable We are but warriors for the workingday Our gayness and our gilt are all besmirch'd With rainy marching in the painful field There's not a piece of feather in our host Good argument I hope we will not fly And time hath worn us into slovenry But by the mass our hearts are in the trim And my poor soldiers tell me yet ere night They'll be in fresher robes or they will pluck The gay new coats o'er the French soldiers' heads And turn them out of service If they do this As if God please they shall my ransom then Will soon be levied Herald save thou thy labour Come thou no more for ransom gentle herald They shall have none I swear but these my joints Which if they have as I will leave 'em them Shall yield them little
