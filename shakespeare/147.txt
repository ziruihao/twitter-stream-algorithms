 Venice and Cyprus Venice A streetRoderigo and IagoTush never tell me I take it much unkindly That thou Iago who hast had my purse As if the strings were thine shouldst know of thisblood but you will not hear me If ever I did dream of such a matter Abhor meThou told'st me thou didst hold him in thy hateDespise me if I do not Three great ones of the city In personal suit to make me his lieutenant Offcapp'd to him and by the faith of man I know my price I am worth no worse a place But he as loving his own pride and purposes Evades them with a bumbast circumstance Horribly stuff'd with epithets of war And in conclusion Nonsuits my mediators for Certes says he I have already chose my officer And what was he Forsooth a great arithmetician One Michael Cassio a Florentine A fellow almost damn'd in a fair wife That never set a squadron in the field Nor the division of a battle knows More than a spinster unless the bookish theoric Wherein the toged consuls can propose As masterly as he Mere prattle without practice Is all his soldiership But he sir had the election And I of whom his eyes had seen the proof At Rhodes at Cyprus and on other grounds Christian and heathen must be belee'd and calm'd By debitor and creditor This countercaster He in good time must his lieutenant be And I God bless the mark his Moorship's ancientBy heaven I rather would have been his hangmanWhy there's no remedy 'Tis the curse of service Preferment goes by letter and affection And not by old gradation where each second Stood heir to the first Now sir be judge yourself Whether I in any just term am affined To love the MoorI would not follow him thenO sir content you I follow him to serve my turn upon him We cannot all be masters nor all masters Cannot be truly follow'd You shall mark Many a duteous and kneecrooking knave That doting on his own obsequious bondage Wears out his time much like his master's ass For nought but provender and when he's old cashier'd Whip me such honest knaves Others there are Who trimm'd in forms and visages of duty Keep yet their hearts attending on themselves And throwing but shows of service on their lords Do well thrive by them and when they have lined their coats Do themselves homage These fellows have some soul And such a one do I profess myself For sir It is as sure as you are Roderigo Were I the Moor I would not be Iago In following him I follow but myself Heaven is my judge not I for love and duty But seeming so for my peculiar end For when my outward action doth demonstrate The native act and figure of my heart In complement extern 'tis not long after But I will wear my heart upon my sleeve For daws to peck at I am not what I amWhat a full fortune does the thicklips owe If he can carry't thusCall up her father Rouse him make after him poison his delight Proclaim him in the streets incense her kinsmen And though he in a fertile climate dwell Plague him with flies Though that his joy be joy Yet throw such changes of vexation on't As it may lose some colorHere is her father's house I'll call aloudDo with like timorous accent and dire yell As when by night and negligence the fire Is spied in populous citiesWhat ho Brabantio Signior

With such loud reason to the Cyprus wars Which even now stands in act that for their souls Another of his fathom they have none To lead their business in which regard Though I do hate him as I do hell pains Yet for necessity of present life I must show out a flag and sign of love Which is indeed but sign That you shall surely find him Lead to the Sagittary the raised search And there will I be with him So farewellbelow Brabantio in his nightgown and Servants with torchesIt is too true an evil gone she is And what's to come of my despised time Is nought but bitterness Now Roderigo Where didst

the conscience To do no contrived murther I lack iniquity Sometimes to do me service Nine or ten times I had thought to have yerk'd him here under the ribs'Tis better as it is Nay but he prated And spoke such scurvy and provoking terms Against your honor That with the little godliness I have I did full hard forbear him But I pray you sir Are you fast married Be assured of this That the magnifico is much beloved And hath in his effect a voice potential As double as the Duke's He will divorce you Or put upon you what restraint and grievance The law with all his might to enforce it on Will give

the MoorDown with him thiefThey draw on both sidesYou Roderigo Come sir I am for youKeep up your bright swords for the dew will rust them Good signior you shall more command with years Than with your weaponsO thou foul thief where hast thou stow'd my daughter Damn'd as thou art thou hast enchanted her For I'll refer me to all things of sense If she in chains of magic were not bound Whether a maid so tender fair and happy So opposite to marriage that she shunn'd The wealthy curled darlings of our nation Would ever have to incur a general mock Run from her guardage to the sooty bosom Of such a thing as thou to fear not to delight Judge me the world if 'tis not gross in sense That thou hast practiced on her with foul charms Abused her delicate youth with drugs or minerals That weaken motion I'll have't disputed on 'Tis probable and palpable to thinking I therefore apprehend and do attach thee For an abuser of the world a practicer Of arts inhibited and out of warrant Lay hold upon him If he do resist Subdue him at his perilHold your hands Both you of my inclining and the rest Were it my cue to fight I should have known it Without a prompter Where will you that I go To answer this your charge To prison till fit time Of law and course of direct session Call thee to answerWhat if I do obey How may the Duke be therewith satisfied Whose messengers are here about my side Upon some present business of the state To bring me to him 'Tis true most worthy signior The Duke's in council and your noble self I am sure is sent for How The Duke in council In this time of the night Bring him away Mine's not an idle cause The Duke himself Or any of my brothers of the state Cannot but feel this wrong as 'twere their own For if such actions may have passage free Bond slaves and pagans shall our statesmen beA council chamber The Duke and Senators sitting at a table Officers attendingThere is no composition in these news That gives them credit Indeed they are disproportion'd My letters say a hundred and seven galleysAnd mine a hundred and forty And mine two hundred But though they jump not on a just account As in these cases where the aim reports 'Tis oft with difference yet do they all confirm A Turkish fleet and bearing up to CyprusNay it is possible enough to judgement I do not so secure me in the error But the main article I do approve In fearful senseWithin What ho What ho What hoA messenger from the galleysSailor Now what's the businessThe Turkish preparation makes for Rhodes So was I bid report here to the state By Signior AngeloHow say you by this change This cannot be By no assay of reason 'tis a pageant To keep us in false gaze When we consider The importancy of Cyprus to the Turk And let ourselves again but understand That as it more concerns the Turk than Rhodes So may he with more facile question bear it For that it stands not in such warlike brace But altogether lacks the abilities That Rhodes is dress'd in If we make thought of this We must not think the Turk is so unskillful To leave that latest which concerns him first Neglecting an attempt of ease and gain To wake and wage a danger profitlessNay in all confidence he's not for RhodesHere is more newsa MessengerThe Ottomites reverend and gracious Steering with due course toward the isle of Rhodes Have there injointed them with an after fleetAy so I thought How many as you guessOf thirty sail and now they do restem Their backward course bearing with frank appearance Their purposes toward Cyprus Signior Montano Your trusty and most valiant servitor With his free duty recommends you thus And prays you to believe him'Tis certain then for Cyprus Marcus Luccicos is not he in townHe's now in FlorenceWrite from us to him postposthaste dispatchHere comes Brabantio and the valiant Moor Brabantio Othello Iago Roderigo and OfficersValiant Othello we must straight employ you Against the general enemy Ottoman To Brabantio I did not see you welcome gentle signior We lack'd your counsel and your help tonightSo did I yours Good your Grace pardon me Neither my place nor aught I heard of business Hath raised me from my bed nor doth the general care Take hold on me for my particular grief Is of so floodgate and o'erbearing nature That it engluts and swallows other sorrows And it is still itselfWhy what's the matterMy daughter O my daughter Dead Ay to me She is abused stol'n from me and corrupted By spells and medicines bought of mountebanks For nature so preposterously to err Being not deficient blind or lame of sense Sans witchcraft could notWhoe'er he be that in this foul proceeding Hath thus beguiled your daughter of herself And you of her the bloody book of law You shall yourself read in the bitter letter After your own sense yea though our proper son Stood in your action Humbly I thank your Grace Here is the man this Moor whom now it seems Your special mandate for the state affairs Hath hither broughtWe are very sorry for'tTo Othello What in your own part can you say to thisNothing but this is soMost potent grave and reverend signiors My very noble and approved good masters That I have ta'en away this old man's daughter It is most true true I have married her The very head and front of my offending Hath this extent no more Rude am I in my speech And little blest with the soft phrase of peace For since these arms of mine had seven years' pith Till now some nine moons wasted they have used Their dearest action in the tented field And little of this great world can I speak More than pertains to feats of broil and battle And therefore little shall I grace my cause In speaking for myself Yet by your gracious patience I will a round unvarnish'd tale deliver Of my whole course of love what drugs what charms What conjuration and what mighty magic For such proceeding I am charged withal I won his daughter A maiden never bold Of spirit so still and quiet that her motion Blush'd at herself and she in spite of nature Of years of country credit everything To fall in love with what she fear'd to look on It is judgement maim'd and most imperfect That will confess perfection so could err Against all rules of nature and must be driven To find out practices of cunning hell Why this should be I therefore vouch again That with some mixtures powerful o'er the blood Or with some dram conjured to this effect He wrought upon her To vouch this is no proof Without more certain and more overt test Than these thin habits and poor likelihoods Of modern seeming do prefer against himBut Othello speak Did you by indirect and forced courses Subdue and poison this young maid's affections Or came it by request and such fair question As soul to soul affordethI do beseech you Send for the lady to the Sagittary And let her speak of me before her father If you do find me foul in her report The trust the office I do hold of you Not only take away but let your sentence Even fall upon my lifeFetch Desdemona hitherAncient conduct them you best know the placeIago and Attendants And till she come as truly as to heaven I do confess the vices of my blood So justly to your grave ears I'll present How I did thrive in this fair lady's love And she in mineSay it OthelloHer father loved me oft invited me Still question'd me the story of my life From year to year the battles sieges fortunes That I have pass'd I ran it through even from my boyish days To the very moment that he bade me tell it Wherein I spake of most disastrous chances Of moving accidents by flood and field Of hairbreadth 'scapes i' the imminent deadly breach Of being taken by the insolent foe And sold to slavery of my redemption thence And portance in my travels' history Wherein of antres vast and deserts idle Rough quarries rocks and hills whose heads touch heaven It was my hint to speak such was the process And of the Cannibals that each other eat The Anthropophagi and men whose heads Do grow beneath their shoulders This to hear Would Desdemona seriously incline But still the house affairs would draw her thence Which ever as she could with haste dispatch She'ld come again and with a greedy ear Devour up my discourse which I observing Took once a pliant hour and found good means To draw from her a prayer of earnest heart That I would all my pilgrimage dilate Whereof by parcels she had something heard But not intentively I did consent And often did beguile her of her tears When I did speak of some distressful stroke That my youth suffer'd My story being done She gave me for my pains a world of sighs She swore in faith 'twas strange 'twas passing strange 'Twas pitiful 'twas wondrous pitiful She wish'd she had not heard it yet she wish'd That heaven had made her such a man she thank'd me And bade me if I had a friend that loved her I should but teach him how to tell my story And that would woo her Upon this hint I spake She loved me for the dangers I had pass'd And I loved her that she did pity them This only is the witchcraft I have used Here comes the lady let her witness itDesdemona Iago and AttendantsI think this tale would win my daughter too Good Brabantio Take up this mangled matter at the best Men do their broken weapons rather use Than their bare handsI pray you hear her speak If she confess that she was half the wooer Destruction on my head if my bad blame Light on the man Come hither gentle mistress Do you perceive in all this noble company Where most you owe obedience My noble father I do perceive here a divided duty To you I am bound for life and education My life and education both do learn me How to respect you you are the lord of duty I am hitherto your daughter But here's my husband And so much duty as my mother show'd To you preferring you before her father So much I challenge that I may profess Due to the Moor my lord God be with you I have done Please it your Grace on to the state affairs I had rather to adopt a child than get it Come hither Moor I here do give thee that with all my heart Which but thou hast already with all my heart I would keep from thee For your sake jewel I am glad at soul I have no other child For thy escape would teach me tyranny To hang clogs on them I have done my lordLet me speak like yourself and lay a sentence Which as a grise or step may help these lovers Into your favor When remedies are past the griefs are ended By seeing the worst which late on hopes depended To mourn a mischief that is past and gone Is the next way to draw new mischief on What cannot be preserved when Fortune takes Patience her injury a mockery makes The robb'd that smiles steals something from the thief He robs himself that spends a bootless griefSo let the Turk of Cyprus us beguile We lose it not so long as we can smile He bears the sentence well that nothing bears But the free comfort which from thence he hears But he bears both the sentence and the sorrow That to pay grief must of poor patience borrow These sentences to sugar or to gall Being strong on both sides are equivocal But words are words I never yet did hear That the bruised heart was pierced through the ear I humbly beseech you proceed to the affairs of stateThe Turk with a most mighty preparation makes for Cyprus Othello the fortitude of the place is best known to you and though we have there a substitute of most allowed sufficiency yet opinion a sovereign mistress of effects throws a more safer voice on you You must therefore be content to slubber the gloss of your new fortunes with this more stubborn and boisterous expeditionThe tyrant custom most grave senators Hath made the flinty and steel couch of war My thricedriven bed of down I do agnize A natural and prompt alacrity I find in hardness and do undertake These present wars against the Ottomites Most humbly therefore bending to your state I crave fit disposition for my wife Due reference of place and exhibition With such accommodation and besort As levels with her breeding If you please Be't at her father's I'll not have it soNorNorI would not there reside To put my father in impatient thoughts By being in his eye Most gracious Duke To my unfolding lend your prosperous ear And let me find a charter in your voice To assist my simplenessWhat would you DesdemonaThat I did love the Moor to live with him My downright violence and storm of fortunes May trumpet to the world My heart's subdued Even to the very quality of my lord I saw Othello's visage in his mind And to his honors and his valiant parts Did I my soul and fortunes consecrate So that dear lords if I be left behind A moth of peace and he go to the war The rites for which I love him are bereft me And I a heavy interim shall support By his dear absence Let me go with himLet her have your voices Vouch with me heaven I therefore beg it not To please the palate of my appetite Nor to comply with heat the young affects In me defunct and proper satisfaction But to be free and bounteous to her mind And heaven defend your good souls that you think I will your serious and great business scant For she is with me No when lightwing'd toys Of feather'd Cupid seel with wanton dullness My speculative and officed instruments That my disports corrupt and taint my business Let housewives make a skillet of my helm And all indign and base adversities Make head against my estimationBe it as you shall privately determine Either for her stay or going The affair cries haste And speed must answer't you must hence tonightTonight my lord This nightWith all my heartAt nine i' the morning here we'll meet again Othello leave some officer behind And he shall our commission bring to you With such things else of quality and respect As doth import you So please your Grace my ancient A man he is of honesty and trust To his conveyance I assign my wife With what else needful your good Grace shall think To be sent after me Let it be so Good night to everyone To Brabantio And noble signior If virtue no delighted beauty lack Your soninlaw is far more fair than blackAdieu brave Moor use Desdemona wellLook to her Moor if thou hast eyes to see She has deceived her father and may thee Duke Senators and OfficersMy life upon her faith Honest Iago My Desdemona must I leave to thee I prithee let thy wife attend on her And bring them after in the best advantage Come Desdemona I have but an hour Of love of worldly matters and direction To spend with thee We must obey the timeOthello and DesdemonaIagoWhat say'st thou noble heartWhat will I do thinkest thouWhy go to bed and sleepI will incontinently drown myselfIf thou dost I shall never love thee after Why thou silly gentlemanIt is silliness to live when to live is torment and then have we a prescription to die when death is our physicianO villainous I have looked upon the world for four times seven years and since I could distinguish betwixt a benefit and an injury I never found man that knew how to love himself Ere I would say I would drown myself for the love of a guinea hen I would change my humanity with a baboonWhat should I do I confess it is my shame to be so fond but it is not in my virtue to amend itVirtue a fig 'Tis in ourselves that we are thus or thus Our bodies are gardens to the which our wills are gardeners so that if we will plant nettles or sow lettuce set hyssop and weed up thyme supply it with one gender of herbs or distract it with many either to have it sterile with idleness or manured with industry why the power and corrigible authority of this lies in our wills If the balance of our lives had not one scale of reason to poise another of sensuality the blood and baseness of our natures would conduct us to most preposterous conclusions But we have reason to cool our raging motions our carnal stings our unbitted lusts whereof I take this that you call love to be a sect or scionIt cannot beIt is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of the will Come be a man Drown thyself Drown cats and blind puppies I have professed me thy friend and I confess me knit to thy deserving with cables of perdurable toughness I could never better stead thee than now Put money in thy purse follow thou the wars defeat thy favor with an usurped beard I say put money in thy purse It cannot be that Desdemona should long continue her love to the Moor put money in thy purse nor he his to her It was a violent commencement and thou shalt see an answerable sequestration put but money in thy purse These Moors are changeable in their wills fill thy purse with money The food that to him now is as luscious as locusts shall be to him shortly as acerb as the coloquintida She must change for youth when she is sated with his body she will find the error of her choice She must have change she must therefore put money in thy purse If thou wilt needs damn thyself do it a more delicate way than drowning Make all the money thou canst If sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt an erring barbarian and a supersubtle Venetian be not too hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell thou shalt enjoy her therefore make money A pox of drowning thyself It is clean out of the way Seek thou rather to be hanged in compassing thy joy than to be drowned and go without herWilt thou be fast to my hopes if I depend on the issueThou art sure of me go make money I have told thee often and I retell thee again and again I hate the Moor My cause is hearted thine hath no less reason Let us be conjunctive in our revenge against him If thou canst cuckold him thou dost thyself a pleasure me a sport There are many events in the womb of time which will be delivered Traverse go provide thy money We will have more of this tomorrow AdieuWhere shall we meet i' the morningAt my lodgingI'll be with thee betimesGo to farewell Do you hear RoderigoWhat say youNo more of drowning do you hearI am changed I'll go sell all my land Thus do I ever make my fool my purse For I mine own gain'd knowledge should profane If I would time expend with such a snipe But for my sport and profit I hate the Moor And it is thought abroad that 'twixt my sheets He has done my office I know not if't be true But I for mere suspicion in that kind Will do as if for surety He holds me well The better shall my purpose work on him Cassio's a proper man Let me see now To get his place and to plume up my will In double knavery How how Let's see After some time to abuse Othello's ear That he is too familiar with his wife He hath a person and a smooth dispose To be suspected framed to make women false The Moor is of a free and open nature That thinks men honest that but seem to be so And will as tenderly be led by the nose As asses are I have't It is engender'd Hell and night Must bring this monstrous birth to the world's light
