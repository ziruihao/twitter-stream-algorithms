FlourishThus with imagin'd wing our swift scene flies In motion of no less celerity Than that of thought Suppose that you have seen The wellappointed King at Hampton pier Embark his royalty and his brave fleet With silken streamers the young Phorbus fanning Play with your fancies and in them behold Upon the hempen tackle shipboys climbing Hear the shrill whistle which doth order give To sounds confus'd behold the threaden sails Borne with th' invisible and creeping wind Draw the huge bottoms through the furrowed sea Breasting the lofty surge O do but think You stand upon the rivage and behold A city on th' inconstant billows dancing For so appears this fleet majestical Holding due course to Harfleur Follow follow Grapple your minds to sternage of this navy And leave your England as dead midnight still Guarded with grandsires babies and old women Either past or not arriv'd to pith and puissance For who is he whose chin is but enrich'd With one appearing hair that will not follow These cull'd and choicedrawn cavaliers to France Work work your thoughts and therein see a siege Behold the ordnance on their carriages With fatal mouths gaping on girded Harfleur Suppose th' ambassador from the French comes back Tells Harry that the King doth offer him Katherine his daughter and with her to dowry Some petty and unprofitable dukedoms The offer likes not and the nimble gunner With linstock now the devilish cannon touchesAlarum and chambers go off And down goes all before them Still be kind And eke out our performance with your mind
