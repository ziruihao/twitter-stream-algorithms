welcome my tall fellow Come Sir JohnI'll follow you good Master Robert ShallowBardolph look to our horsesand If I were sawed into quantities I should make four dozen of such bearded hermits' staves as Master Shallow It is a wonderful thing to see the semblable coherence of his men's spirits and his They by observing of him do bear themselves like foolish justices he by conversing with them is turned into a justicelike servingman Their spirits are so married in conjunction with the participation of society that they flock together in consent like so many wild geese If I had a suit to Master Shallow I would humour his men with the imputation of being near their master if to his men I would curry with Master Shallow that no man could better command his servants It is certain that either wise bearing or ignorant carriage is caught as men take diseases one of another therefore let men take heed of their company I will devise matter enough out of this Shallow to keep Prince Harry in continual laughter the wearing out of six fashions which is four terms or two actions and 'a shall laugh without intervallums O it is much that a lie with a slight oath and a jest with a sad brow will do with a fellow that never had the ache in his shoulders O you shall see him laugh till his face be like a wet cloak ill laid up WithinSir JohnI come Master Shallow I come Master ShallowWestminster The palaceseverallyand the How now my Lord Chief Justice whither awayHow doth the KingExceeding well his cares are now all endedI hope not deadHe's walk'd the way of nature And to our purposes he lives no moreI would his Majesty had call'd me with him The service that I truly did his life Hath left me open to all injuriesIndeed I think the young king loves you notI know he doth not and do arm myself To welcome the condition of the time Which cannot look more hideously upon me Than I have drawn it in my fantasy and othersHere comes the heavy issue of dead Harry O that the living Harry had the temper Of he the worst of these three gentlemen How many nobles then should hold their places That must strike sail to spirits of vile sortO God I fear all will be overturn'dGood morrow cousin Warwick good morrow &Good morrow cousinWe meet like men that had forgot to speakWe do remember but our argument Is all too heavy to admit much talkWell peace be with him that hath made us heavyPeace be with us lest we be heavierO good my lord you have lost a friend indeed And I dare swear you borrow not that face Of seeming sorrow it is sure your ownThough no man be assur'd what grace to find You stand in coldest expectation I am the sorrier would 'twere otherwiseWell you must now speak Sir John Falstaff fair Which swims against your stream of qualitySweet Princes what I did I did in honour Led by th' impartial conduct of my soul And never shall you see that I will beg A ragged and forestall'd remission If truth and upright innocency fail me I'll to the King my master that is dead And tell him who hath sent me after himHere comes the Prince attendedGood morrow and God save your MajestyThis new and gorgeous garment majesty Sits not so easy on me as you think Brothers you mix your sadness with some fear This is the English not the Turkish court Not Amurath an Amurath succeeds But Harry Harry Yet be sad good brothers For by my faith it very well becomes you Sorrow so royally in you appears That I will deeply put the fashion on And wear it in my heart Why then be sad But tain no more of it good brothers Than a joint burden laid upon us all For me by heaven I bid you be assur'd I'll be your father and your brother too Let me but bear your love I'll bear your cares Yet weep that Harry's dead and so will I But Harry lives that shall convert those tears By number into hours of happinessWe hope no otherwise from your MajestyYou all look strangely on me and you most You are I think assur'd I love you notI am assur'd if I be measur'd rightly Your Majesty hath no just cause to hate meNo How might a prince of my great hopes forget So great indignities you laid upon me What rate rebuke and roughly send to prison Th' immediate heir of England Was this easy May this be wash'd in Lethe and forgottenI then did use the person of your father The image of his power lay then in me And in th' administration of his law Whiles I was busy for the commonwealth Your Highness pleased to forget my place The majesty and power of law and justice The image of the King whom I presented And struck me in my very seat of judgment Whereon as an offender to your father I gave bold way to my authority And did commit you If the deed were ill Be you contented wearing now the garland To have a son set your decrees at nought To pluck down justice from your awful bench To trip the course of law and blunt the sword That guards the peace and safety of your person Nay more to spurn at your most royal image And mock your workings in a second body Question your royal thoughts make the case yours Be now the father and propose a son Hear your own dignity so much profan'd See your most dreadful laws so loosely slighted Behold yourself so by a son disdain'd And then imagine me taking your part And in your power soft silencing your son After this cold considerance sentence me And as you are a king speak in your state What I have done that misbecame my place My person or my liege's sovereigntyYou are right Justice and you weigh this well Therefore still bear the balance and the sword And I do wish your honours may increase Till you do live to see a son of mine Offend you and obey you as I did So shall I live to speak my father's words 'Happy am I that have a man so bold That dares do justice on my proper son And not less happy having such a son That would deliver up his greatness so Into the hands of justice' You did commit me For which I do commit into your hand Th' unstained sword that you have us'd to bear With this remembrance that you use the same With the like bold just and impartial spirit As you have done 'gainst me There is my hand You shall be as a father to my youth My voice shall sound as you do prompt mine ear And I will stoop and humble my intents To your wellpractis'd wise directions And Princes all believe me I beseech you My father is gone wild into his grave For in his tomb lie my affections And with his spirits sadly I survive To mock the expectation of the world To frustrate prophecies and to raze out Rotten opinion who hath writ me down After my seeming The tide of blood in me Hath proudly flow'd in vanity till now Now doth it turn and ebb back to the sea Where it shall mingle with the state of floods And flow henceforth in formal majesty Now call we our high court of parliament And let us choose such limbs of noble counsel That the great body of our state may go In equal rank with the best govern'd nation That war or peace or both at once may be As things acquainted and familiar to us In which you father shall have foremost hand Our coronation done we will accite As I before rememb'red all our state And God consigning to my good intents No prince nor peer shall have just cause to say God shorten Harry's

will you henceFirst my fear then my curtsy last my speech My fear is your displeasure my curtsy my duty and my speech to beg your pardons If you look for a good speech now you undo me for what I have to say is of mine own making and what indeed I should say will I doubt prove mine own marring But to the purpose and so to the venture Be it known to you as it is very well I was lately here in the end of a displeasing play to pray your patience for it and to promise you a better I meant indeed to pay you with this which if like an ill venture it come unluckily home I break and you my gentle creditors lose Here I promis'd you I would be and here I commit my body to your mercies Bate me some and I will pay you some and as most debtors do promise you infinitely and so I kneel down before you but indeed to pray for the Queen If my tongue cannot entreat you to acquit me will you command me to use my legs And yet that were but light paymentto dance out of your debt But a good conscience will make any possible satisfaction and so wouldAll the gentlewomen here have forgiven me If the gentlemen will not then the gentlemen do not agree with the gentlewomen which was never seen before in such an assembly One word more I beseech you If you be not too much cloy'd with fat meat our humble author will continue the story with Sir John in it and make you merry with fair Katherine of France where for anything I know Falstaff shall die of a sweat unless already 'a be killed with your hard opinions for Oldcastle died a martyr and this is not the man My tongue is weary when my legs are too I will bid you good night
