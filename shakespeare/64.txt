Before Orleansa and two Sirs take your places and be vigilant If any noise or soldier you perceive Near to the walls by some apparent sign Let us have knowledge at the court of guardSergeant you shall Thus are poor servitors When others sleep upon their quiet beds Constrain'd to watch in darkness rain and coldand forces with scalingladders their drums beating a dead marchLord Regent and redoubted Burgundy By whose approach the regions of Artois Wallon and Picardy are friends to us This happy night the Frenchmen are secure Having all day carous'd and banqueted Embrace we then this opportunity As fitting best to quittance their deceit Contriv'd by art and baleful sorceryCoward of France how much he wrongs his fame Despairing of his own arm's fortitude To join with witches and the help of hellTraitors have never other company But what's that Pucelle whom they term so pureA maid they sayA maid and be so martialPray God she prove not masculine ere long If underneath the standard of the French She carry armour as she hath begunWell let them practise and converse with spirits God is our fortress in whose conquering name Let us resolve to scale their flinty bulwarksAscend brave Talbot we will follow theeNot all together better far I guess That we do make our entrance several ways That if it chance the one of us do fail The other yet may rise against their forceAgreed I'll to yond cornerAnd I to thisAnd here will Talbot mount or make his grave Now Salisbury for thee and for the right Of English Henry shall this night appear How much in duty I am bound to bothThe English scale the walls and cry aint Georgea Talbot'Arm arm The enemy doth make assaultThe French leap o'er the walls in their shirts several ways half ready and half unreadyHow now my lords What all unready soUnready Ay and glad we 'scap'd so well'Twas time I trow to wake and leave our beds Hearing alarums at our chamber doorsOf all exploits since first I follow'd arms Ne'er heard I of a warlike prise More venturous or desperate than thisI think this Talbot be a fiend of hellIf not of hell the heavens sure favour himHere cometh Charles I marvel how he spedandTut holy Joan was his defensive guardIs this thy cunning thou deceitful dame Didst thou at first to flatter us withal Make us partakers of a little gain That now our loss might be ten times so muchWherefore is Charles impatient with his friend At all times will you have my power alike Sleeping or waking must I still prevail Or will you blame and lay the fault on me Improvident soldiers Had your watch been good This sudden mischief never could have fall'nDuke of Alencon this was your default That being captain of the watch tonight Did look no better to that weighty chargeHad all your quarters been as safely kept As that whereof I had the government We had not been thus shamefully surpris'dMine was secureAnd so was mine my lordAnd for myself most part of all this night Within her quarter and mine own precinct I was employ'd in passing to and fro About relieving of the sentinels Then how or which way should they first break inQuestion my lords no further of the case How or which way 'tis sure they found some place But weakly guarded where the breach was made And now there rests no other shift but this To gather our soldiers scatter'd and dispers'd And lay new platforms to endamage themAlarumancrying 'A Talbot A Talbot' They fly leaving theirclothes behindI'll be so bold to take what they have left The cry of Talbot serves me for a sword For I have loaden me with many spoils Using no other weapon but his nameWithin the town a and othersThe day begins to break and night is fled Whose pitchy mantle overveil'd the earth Here sound retreat and cease our hot pursuitRetreat soundedBring forth the body of old Salisbury And here advance it in the marketplace The middle centre of this cursed town Now have I paid my vow unto his soul For every drop of blood was drawn from him There hath at least five Frenchmen died tonight And that hereafter ages may behold What ruin happened in revenge of him Within their chiefest temple I'll erect A tomb wherein his corpse shall be interr'd Upon the which that every one may read Shall be engrav'd the sack of Orleans The treacherous manner of his mournful death And what a terror he had been to France But lords in all our bloody massacre I muse we met not with the Dauphin's grace His newcome champion virtuous Joan of Arc Nor any of his false confederates'Tis thought Lord Talbot when the fight began Rous'd on the sudden from their drowsy beds They did amongst the troops of armed men Leap o'er the walls for refuge in the fieldMyself as far as I could well discern For smoke and dusky vapours of the night Am sure I scar'd the Dauphin and his trull When arm in arm they both came swiftly running Like to a pair of loving turtledoves That could not live asunder day or night After that things are set in order here We'll follow them with all the power we havea All hail my lords Which of this princely train Call ye the warlike Talbot for his acts So much applauded through the realm of FranceHere is the Talbot who would speak with himThe virtuous lady Countess of Auvergne With modesty admiring thy renown By me entreats great lord thou wouldst vouchsafe To visit her poor castle where she lies That she may boast she hath beheld the man Whose glory fills the world with loud reportIs it even so Nay then I see our wars Will turn into a peaceful comic sport When ladies crave to be encount'red with You may not my lord despise her gentle suitNe'er trust me then for when a world of men Could not prevail with all their oratory Yet hath a woman's kindness overrul'd And therefore tell her I return great thanks And in submission will attend on her Will not your honours bear me companyNo truly 'tis more than manners will And I have heard it said unbidden guests Are often welcomest when they are goneWell then alone since there's no remedy I mean to prove this lady's courtesy Come hither CaptainWhispers You perceive my mindI do my lord and mean accordinglyThe Castle the and her Porter remember what I gave in charge And when you have done so bring the keys to meMadam I willThe plot is laid if all things fall out right I shall as famous be by this exploit As Scythian Tomyris by Cyrus' death Great is the rumour of this dreadful knight And his achievements of no less account Fain would mine eyes be witness with mine ears To give their censure of these rare reportsand Madam according as your ladyship desir'd By message crav'd so is Lord Talbot comeAnd he is welcome What is this the manMadam it isIs this the scourge of France Is this Talbot so much fear'd abroad That with his name the mothers still their babes I see report is fabulous and false I thought I should have seen some Hercules A second Hector for his grim aspect And large proportion of his strongknit limbs Alas this is a child a silly dwarf It cannot be this weak and writhled shrimp Should strike such terror to his enemiesMadam I have been bold to trouble you But since your ladyship is not at leisure I'll sort some other time to visit youGoingWhat means he now Go ask him whither he goesStay my Lord Talbot for my lady craves To know the cause of your abrupt departureMarry for that she's in a wrong belief I go to certify her Talbot's here Re With keysIf thou be he then art thou prisonerPrisoner To whomTo me bloodthirsty lord And for that cause I train'd thee to my house Long time thy shadow hath been thrall to me For in my gallery thy picture hangs But now the substance shall endure the like And I will chain these legs and arms of thine That hast by tyranny these many years Wasted our country slain our citizens And sent our sons and husbands captivateHa ha haLaughest thou wretch Thy mirth shall turn to moanI laugh to see your ladyship so fond To think that you have aught but Talbot's shadow Whereon to practise your severityWhy art not thou the manI am indeedThen have I substance tooNo no I am but shadow of myself You are deceiv'd my substance is not here For what you see is but the smallest part And least proportion of humanity I tell you madam were the whole frame here It is of such a spacious lofty pitch Your roof were not sufficient to contain 'tThis is a riddling merchant for the nonce He will be here and yet he is not here How can these contrarieties agreeThat will I show you presentlyWinds his horn drums strike up a peal of ordnancesoldiers How say you madam Are you now persuaded That Talbot is but shadow of himself These are his substance sinews arms and strength With which he yoketh your rebellious necks Razeth your cities and subverts your towns And in a moment makes them desolateVictorious Talbot pardon my abuse I find thou art no less than fame hath bruited And more than may be gathered by thy shape Let my presumption not provoke thy wrath For I am sorry that with reverence I did not tain thee as thou artBe not dismay'd fair lady nor misconster The mind of Talbot as you did mistake The outward composition of his body What you have done hath not offended me Nor other satisfaction do I crave But only with your patience that we may Taste of your wine and see what cates you have For soldiers' stomachs always serve them wellWith all my heart and think me honoured To feast so great a warrior in my houseLondon The Temple garden theand and another Great lords and gentlemen what means this silence Dare no man answer in a case of truthWithin the Temple Hall we were too loud The garden here is more convenientThen say at once if I maintain'd the truth Or else was wrangling Somerset in th' errorFaith I have been a truant in the law And never yet could frame my will to it And therefore frame the law unto my willJudge you my Lord of Warwick then between usBetween two hawks which flies the higher pitch Between two dogs which hath the deeper mouth Between two blades which bears the better temper Between two horses which doth bear him best Between two girls which hath the merriest eye I have perhaps some shallow spirit of judgment But in these nice sharp quillets of the law Good faith I am no wiser than a dawTut tut here is a mannerly forbearance The truth appears so naked on my side That any purblind eye may find it outAnd on my side it is so well apparell'd So clear so shining and so evident That it will glimmer through a blind man's eyeSince you are tonguetied and so loath to speak In dumb significants proclaim your thoughts Let him that is a trueborn gentleman And stands upon the honour of his birth If he suppose that I have pleaded truth From off this brier pluck a white rose with meLet him that is no coward nor no flatterer But dare maintain the party of the truth Pluck a red rose from off this thorn with meI love no colours and without all colour Of base insinuating flattery I pluck this white rose with PlantagenetI pluck this red rose with young Somerset And say withal I think he held the rightStay lords and gentlemen and pluck no more Till you conclude that he upon whose side The fewest roses are cropp'd from the tree Shall yield the other in the right opinionGood Master Vernon it is well objected If I have fewest I subscribe in silenceAnd Then for the truth and plainness of the case I pluck this pale and maiden blossom here Giving my verdict on the white rose sidePrick not your finger as you pluck it off Lest bleeding you do paint the white rose red And fall on my side so against your willIf I my lord for my opinion bleed Opinion shall be surgeon to my hurt And keep me on the side where still I amWell well come on who else To SomersetUnless my study and my books be false The argument you held was wrong in you In sign whereof I pluck a white rose tooNow Somerset where is your argumentHere in my scabbard meditating that Shall dye your white rose in a bloody redMeantime your cheeks do counterfeit our roses For pale they look with fear as witnessing The truth on our sideNo Plantagenet 'Tis not for fear but anger that thy cheeks Blush for pure shame to counterfeit our roses And yet thy tongue will not confess thy errorHath not thy rose a canker SomersetHath not thy rose a thorn PlantagenetAy sharp and piercing to maintain his truth Whiles thy consuming canker eats his falsehoodWell I'll find friends to wear my bleeding roses That shall maintain what I have said is true Where false Plantagenet dare not be seenNow by this maiden blossom in my hand I scorn thee and thy fashion peevish boyTurn not thy scorns this way PlantagenetProud Pole I will and scorn both him and theeI'll turn my part thereof into thy throatAway away good William de la Pole We grace the yeoman by conversing with himNow by God's will thou wrong'st him Somerset His grandfather was Lionel Duke of Clarence Third son to the third Edward King of England Spring crestless yeomen from so deep a rootHe bears him on the place's privilege Or durst not for his craven heart say thusBy Him that made me I'll maintain my words On any plot of ground in Christendom Was not thy father Richard Earl of Cambridge For treason executed in our late king's days And by his treason stand'st not thou attainted Corrupted and exempt from ancient gentry His trespass yet lives guilty in thy blood And till thou be restor'd thou art a yeomanMy father was attached not attainted Condemn'd to die for treason but no traitor And that I'll prove on better men than Somerset Were growing time once ripened to my will For your partaker Pole and you yourself I'll note you in my book of memory To scourge you for this apprehension Look to it well and say you are well warn'dAy thou shalt find us ready for thee still And know us by these colours for thy foes For these my friends in spite of thee shall wearAnd by my soul this pale and angry rose As cognizance of my blooddrinking hate Will I for ever and my faction wear Until it wither with me to my grave Or flourish to the height of my degreeGo forward and be chok'd with thy ambition And so farewell until I meet thee next Have with thee Pole Farewell ambitious RichardHow I am brav'd and must perforce endure itThis blot that they object against your house Shall be wip'd out in the next Parliament Call'd for the truce of Winchester and Gloucester And if thou be not then created York I will not live to be accounted Warwick Meantime in signal of my love to thee Against proud Somerset and William Pole Will I upon thy party wear this rose And here I prophesy this brawl today Grown to this faction in the Temple Garden Shall send between the Red Rose and the White A thousand souls to death and deadly nightGood Master Vernon I am bound to you That you on my behalf would pluck a flowerIn your behalf still will I wear the sameAnd so will Thanks gentle sir Come let us four to dinner I dare say This quarrel will drink blood another day The Tower of Londonbrought in a chair and Kind keepers of my weak decaying age Let dying Mortimer here rest himself Even like a man new haled from the rack So fare my limbs with long imprisonment And these grey locks the pursuivants of death Nestorlike aged in an age of care Argue the end of Edmund Mortimer These eyes like lamps whose wasting oil is spent Wax dim as drawing to their exigent Weak shoulders overborne with burdening grief And pithless arms like to a withered vine That droops his sapless branches to the ground Yet are these feet whose strengthless stay is numb Unable to support this lump of clay Swiftwinged with desire to get a grave As witting I no other comfort have But tell me keeper will my nephew comeRichard Plantagenet my lord will come We sent unto the Temple unto his chamber And answer was return'd that he will comeEnough my soul shall then be satisfied Poor gentleman his wrong doth equal mine Since Henry Monmouth first began to reign Before whose glory I was great in arms This loathsome sequestration have I had And even since then hath Richard been obscur'd Depriv'd of honour and inheritance But now the arbitrator of despairs Just Death kind umpire of men's miseries With sweet enlargement doth dismiss me hence I would his troubles likewise were expir'd That so he might recover what was lost My lord your loving nephew now is comeRichard Plantagenet my friend is he comeAy noble uncle thus ignobly us'd Your nephew late despised Richard comesDirect mine arms I may embrace his neck And in his bosom spend my latter gasp O tell me when my lips do touch his cheeks That I may kindly give one fainting kiss And now declare sweet stem from York's great stock Why didst thou say of late thou wert despis'dFirst lean thine aged back against mine arm And in that ease I'll tell thee my disease This day in argument upon a case Some words there grew 'twixt Somerset and me Among which terms he us'd his lavish tongue And did upbraid me with my father's death Which obloquy set bars before my tongue Else with the like I had requited him Therefore good uncle for my father's sake In honour of a true Plantagenet And for alliance sake declare the cause My father Earl of Cambridge lost his headThat cause fair nephew that imprison'd me And hath detain'd me all my flow'ring youth Within a loathsome dungeon there to pine Was cursed instrument of his deceaseDiscover more at large what cause that was For I am ignorant and cannot guessI will if that my fading breath permit And death approach not ere my tale be done Henry the Fourth grandfather to this king Depos'd his nephew Richard Edward's son The firstbegotten and the lawful heir Of Edward king the third of that descent During whose reign the Percies of the north Finding his usurpation most unjust Endeavour'd my advancement to the throne The reason mov'd these warlike lords to this Was for thatyoung Richard thus remov'd Leaving no heir begotten of his body I was the next by birth and parentage For by my mother I derived am From Lionel Duke of Clarence third son To King Edward the Third whereas he From John of Gaunt doth bring his pedigree Being but fourth of that heroic line But mark as in this haughty great attempt They laboured to plant the rightful heir I lost my liberty and they their lives Long after this when Henry the Fifth Succeeding his father Bolingbroke did reign Thy father Earl of Cambridge then deriv'd From famous Edmund Langley Duke of York Marrying my sister that thy mother was Again in pity of my hard distress Levied an army weening to redeem And have install'd me in the diadem But as the rest so fell that noble earl And was beheaded Thus the Mortimers In whom the title rested were suppress'dOf Which my lord your honour is the lastTrue and thou seest that I no issue have And that my fainting words do warrant death Thou art my heir the rest I wish thee gather But yet be wary in thy studious careThy grave admonishments prevail with me But yet methinks my father's execution Was nothing less than bloody tyrannyWith silence nephew be thou politic Strong fixed is the house of Lancaster And like a mountain not to be remov'd But now thy uncle is removing hence As princes do their courts when they are cloy'd With long continuance in a settled placeO uncle would some part of my young years Might but redeem the passage of your ageThou dost then wrong me as that slaughterer doth Which giveth many wounds when one will kill Mourn not except thou sorrow for my good Only give order for my funeral And so farewell and fair be all thy hopes And prosperous be thy life in peace and warDiesAnd peace no war befall thy parting soul In prison hast thou spent a pilgrimage And like a hermit overpass'd thy days Well I will lock his counsel in my breast And what I do imagine let that rest Keepers convey him hence and I myself Will see his burial better than his life hearing out the body ofHere dies the dusky torch of Mortimer Chok'd with ambition of the meaner sort And for those wrongs those bitter injuries Which Somerset hath offer'd to my house I doubt not but with honour to redress And therefore haste I to the Parliament Either to be restored to my blood Or make my ill th' advantage of my good
