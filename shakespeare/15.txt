The forestand I prithee pretty youth let me be better acquainted with theeThey say you are a melancholy fellowI am so I do love it better than laughingThose that are in extremity of either are abominable fellows and betray themselves to every modern censure worse than drunkardsWhy 'tis good to be sad and say nothingWhy then 'tis good to be a postI have neither the scholar's melancholy which is emulation nor the musician's which is fantastical nor the courtier's which is proud nor the soldier's which is ambitious nor the lawyer's which is politic nor the lady's which is nice nor the lover's which is all these but it is a melancholy of mine own compounded of many simples extracted from many objects and indeed the sundry contemplation of my travels in which my often rumination wraps me in a most humorous sadnessA traveller By my faith you have great reason to be sad I fear you have sold your own lands to see other men's then to have seen much and to have nothing is to have rich eyes and poor handsYes I have gain'd my experienceAnd your experience makes you sad I had rather have a fool to make me merry than experience to make me sad and to travel for it tooGood day and happiness dear RosalindNay then God buy you an you talk in blank verseFarewell Monsieur Traveller look you lisp and wear strange suits disable all the benefits of your own country be out of love with your nativity and almost chide God for making you that countenance you are or I will scarce think you have swam in a gondola Why how now Orlando where have you been all this while You a lover An you serve me such another trick never come in my sight moreMy fair Rosalind I come within an hour of my promiseBreak an hour's promise in love He that will divide a minute into a thousand parts and break but a part of the thousand part of a minute in the affairs of love it may be said of him that Cupid hath clapp'd him o' th' shoulder but I'll warrant him heartwholePardon me dear RosalindNay an you be so tardy come no more in my sight I had as lief be woo'd of a snailOf a snailAy of a snail for though he comes slowly he carries his house on his head a better jointure I think than you make a woman besides he brings his destiny with himWhat's thatWhy horns which such as you are fain to be beholding to your wives for but he comes armed in his fortune and prevents the slander of his wifeVirtue is no hornmaker and my Rosalind is virtuousAnd I am your RosalindIt pleases him to call you so but he hath a Rosalind of a better leer than youCome woo me woo me for now I am in a holiday humour and like enough to consent What would you say to me now an I were your very very RosalindI would kiss before I spokeNay you were better speak first and when you were gravell'd for lack of matter you might take occasion to kiss Very good orators when they are out they will spit and for lovers lacking God warn us matter the cleanliest shift is to kissHow if the kiss be deniedThen she puts you to entreaty and there begins new matterWho could be out being before his beloved mistressMarry that should you if I were your mistress or I should think my honesty ranker than my witWhat of my suitNot out of your apparel and yet out of your suit Am not I your RosalindI take some joy to say you are because I would be talking of herWell in her person I say I will not have youThen in mine own person I dieNo faith die by attorney The poor world is almost six thousand years old and in all this time there was not any man died in his own person videlicet in a lovecause Troilus had his brains dash'd out with a Grecian club yet he did what he could to die before and he is one of the patterns of love Leander he would have liv'd many a fair year though Hero had turn'd nun if it had not been for a hot midsummer night for good youth he went but forth to wash him in the Hellespont and being taken with the cramp was drown'd and the foolish chroniclers of that age found it was Hero of Sestos But these are all lies men have died from time to time and worms have eaten them but not for loveI would not have my right Rosalind of this mind for I protest her frown might kill meBy this hand it will not kill a fly But come now I will be your Rosalind in a more comingon disposition and ask me what you will I will grant itThen love me RosalindYes faith will I Fridays and Saturdays and allAnd wilt thou have meAy and twenty suchWhat sayest thouAre you not goodI hope soWhy then can one desire too much of a good thing Come sister you shall be the priest and marry us Give me your hand Orlando What do you say sisterPray thee marry usI cannot say the wordsYou must begin 'Will you Orlando'Go to Will you Orlando have to wife this RosalindI willAy but whenWhy now as fast as she can marry usThen you must say 'I take thee Rosalind for wife'I take thee Rosalind for wifeI might ask you for your commission but I do take thee Orlando for my husband There's a girl goes before the priest and certainly a woman's thought runs before her actionsSo do all thoughts they are wing'dNow tell me how long you would have her after you have possess'd herFor ever and a daySay 'a day' without the 'ever' No no Orlando men are April when they woo December when they wed maids are May when they are maids but the sky changes when they are wives I will be more jealous of thee than a Barbary cockpigeon over his hen more clamorous than a parrot against rain more newfangled than an ape more giddy in my desires than a monkey I will weep for nothing like Diana in the fountain and I will do that when you are dispos'd to be merry I will laugh like a hyen and that when thou are inclin'd to sleepBut will my Rosalind do soBy my life she will do as I doO but she is wiseOr else she could not have the wit to do this The wiser the waywarder Make the doors upon a woman's wit and it will out at the casement shut that and 'twill out at the keyhole stop that 'twill fly with the smoke out at the chimneyA man that had a wife with such a wit he might say 'Wit whither wilt'Nay you might keep that check for it till you met your wife's wit going to your neighbour's bedAnd what wit could wit have to excuse thatMarry to say she came to seek you there You shall never take her without her answer unless you take her without her tongue O that woman that cannot make her fault her husband's occasion let her never nurse her child herself for she will breed it like a foolFor these two hours Rosalind I will leave theeAlas dear love I cannot lack thee two hoursI must attend the Duke at dinner by two o'clock I will be with thee againAy go your ways go your ways I knew what you would prove my friends told me as much and I thought no less That flattering tongue of yours won me 'Tis but one cast away and so come death Two o'clock is your hourAy sweet RosalindBy my troth and in good earnest and so God mend me and by all pretty oaths that are not dangerous if you break one jot of your promise or come one minute behind your hour I will think you the most pathetical breakpromise and the most hollow lover and the most unworthy of her you call Rosalind that may be chosen out of the gross band of the unfaithful Therefore beware my censure and keep your promiseWith no less religion than if thou wert indeed my Rosalind so adieuWell Time is the old justice that examines all such offenders and let Time try AdieuYou have simply misus'd our sex in your loveprate We must have your doublet and hose pluck'd over your head and show the world what the bird hath done to her own nestO coz coz coz my pretty little coz that thou didst know how many fathom deep I am in love But it cannot be sounded my affection hath an unknown bottom like the Bay of PortugalOr rather bottomless that as fast as you pour affection in it runs outNo that same wicked bastard of Venus that was begot of thought conceiv'd of spleen and born of madness that blind rascally boy that abuses every one's eyes because his own are out let him be judge how deep I am in love I'll tell thee Aliena I cannot be out of the sight of Orlando I'll go find a shadow and sigh till he comeAnd I'll sleepThe forestandin the habit of forestersWhich is he that killed the deerSir it was Let's present him to the Duke like a Roman conqueror and it would do well to set the deer's horns upon his head for a branch of victory Have you no song forester for this purposeYes sirSing it 'tis no matter how it be in tune so it make noise enoughWhat shall he have that kill'd the deer His leather skin and horns to wear The rest shall hear this burdenThen sing him home Take thou no scorn to wear the horn It was a crest ere thou wast bornThy father's father wore itAnd thy father bore it The horn the horn the lusty horn Is not a thing to laugh to scorn The forestand How say you now Is it not past two o'clock And here much OrlandoI warrant you with pure love and troubled brain he hath ta'en his bow and arrows and is gone forth to sleep Look who comes hereMy errand is to you fair youth My gentle Phebe did bid me give you this I know not the contents but as I guess By the stern brow and waspish action Which she did use as she was writing of it It bears an angry tenour Pardon me I am but as a guiltless messengerPatience herself would startle at this letter And play the swaggerer Bear this bear all She says I am not fair that I lack manners She calls me proud and that she could not love me Were man as rare as Phoenix 'Od's my will Her love is not the hare that I do hunt Why writes she so to me Well shepherd well This is a letter of your own deviceNo I protest I know not the contents Phebe did write itCome come you are a fool And turn'd into the extremity of love I saw her hand she has a leathern hand A freestonecolour'd hand I verily did think That her old gloves were on but 'twas her hands She has a huswife's hand but that's no matter I say she never did invent this letter This is a man's invention and his handSure it is hersWhy 'tis a boisterous and a cruel style A style for challengers Why she defies me Like Turk to Christian Women's gentle brain Could not drop forth such giantrude invention Such Ethiope words blacker in their effect Than in their countenance Will you hear the letterSo please you for I never heard it yet Yet heard too much of Phebe's crueltyShe Phebes me mark how the tyrant writesReads 'Art thou god to shepherd turn'd That a maiden's heart hath burn'd' Can a woman rail thusCall you this railing'Why thy godhead laid apartWarr'st thou with a woman's heart' Did you ever hear such railing 'Whiles the eye of man did woo me That could do no vengeance to me' Meaning me a beast 'If the scorn of your bright eyne Have power to raise such love in mine Alack in me what strange effect Would they work in mild aspect Whiles you chid me I did love How then might your prayers move He that brings this love to the Little knows this love in me And by him seal up thy mind Whether that thy youth and kind Will the faithful offer take Of me and all that I can make Or else by him my love deny And then I'll study how to die'Call you this chidingAlas poor shepherdDo you pity him No he deserves no pity Wilt thou love such a woman What to make thee an instrument and play false strains upon thee Not to be endur'd Well go your way to her for I see love hath made thee tame snake and say this to her that if she love me I charge her to love thee if she will not I will never have her unless thou entreat for her If you be a true lover hence and not a word for here comes more company Good morrow fair ones pray you if you know Where in the purlieus of this forest stands A sheepcote fenc'd about with olive treesWest of this place down in the neighbour bottom The rank of osiers by the murmuring stream Left on your right hand brings you to the place But at this hour the house doth keep itself There's none withinIf that an eye may profit by a tongue Then should I know you by description Such garments and such years 'The boy is fair Of female favour and bestows himself Like a ripe sister the woman low And browner than her brother' Are not you The owner of the house I did inquire forIt is no boast being ask'd to say we areOrlando doth commend him to you both And to that youth he calls his Rosalind He sends this bloody napkin Are you heI am What must we understand by thisSome of my shame if you will know of me What man I am and how and why and where This handkercher was stain'dI pray you tell itWhen last the young Orlando parted from you He left a promise to return again Within an hour and pacing through the forest Chewing the food of sweet and bitter fancy Lo what befell He threw his eye aside And mark what object did present itself Under an oak whose boughs were moss'd with age And high top bald with dry antiquity A wretched ragged man o'ergrown with hair Lay sleeping on his back About his neck A green and gilded snake had wreath'd itself Who with her head nimble in threats approach'd The opening of his mouth but suddenly Seeing Orlando it unlink'd itself And with indented glides did slip away Into a bush under which bush's shade A lioness with udders all drawn dry Lay couching head on ground with catlike watch When that the sleeping man should stir for 'tis The royal disposition of that beast To prey on nothing that doth seem as dead This seen Orlando did approach the man And found it was his brother his elder brotherO I have heard him speak of that same brother And he did render him the most unnatural That liv'd amongst menAnd well he might so do For well I know he was unnaturalBut to Orlando did he leave him there Food to the suck'd and hungry lionessTwice did he turn his back and purpos'd so But kindness nobler ever than revenge And nature stronger than his just occasion Made him give battle to the lioness Who quickly fell before him in which hurtling From miserable slumber I awak'dAre you his brotherWas't you he rescu'dWas't you that did so oft contrive to kill him'Twas I but 'tis notI do not shame To tell you what I was since my conversion So sweetly tastes being the thing I amBut for the bloody napkinBy and by When from the first to last betwixt us two Tears our recountments had most kindly bath'd As how I came into that desert place In brief he led me to the gentle Duke Who gave me fresh array and tainment Committing me unto my brother's love Who led me instantly unto his cave There stripp'd himself and here upon his arm The lioness had torn some flesh away Which all this while had bled and now he fainted And cried in fainting upon Rosalind Brief I recover'd him bound up his wound And after some small space being strong at heart He sent me hither stranger as I am To tell this story that you might excuse His broken promise and to give this napkin Dy'd in his blood unto the shepherd youth That he in sport doth call his RosalindswoonsWhy how now Ganymede sweet GanymedeMany will swoon when they do look on bloodThere is more in it Cousin GanymedeLook he recoversI would I were at homeWe'll lead you thither I pray you will you take him by the armBe of good cheer youth You a man You lack a man's heartI do so I confess it Ah sirrah a body would think this was well counterfeited I pray you tell your brother how well I counterfeited HeighhoThis was not counterfeit there is too great testimony in your complexion that it was a passion of earnestCounterfeit I assure youWell then take a good heart and counterfeit to be a manSo I do but i' faith I should have been a woman by rightCome you look paler and paler pray you draw homewards Good sir go with usThat will I for I must bear answer back How you excuse my brother RosalindI shall devise something but I pray you commend my counterfeiting to him Will you go
