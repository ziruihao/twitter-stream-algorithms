and our esteem Was made much poorer by it but your son As mad in folly lack'd the sense to know Her estimation home'Tis past my liege And I beseech your Majesty to make it Natural rebellion done i' th' blaze of youth When oil and fire too strong for reason's force O'erbears it and burns onMy honour'd lady I have forgiven and forgotten all Though my revenges were high bent upon him And watch'd the time to shootThis I must say But first I beg my pardon the young lord Did to his Majesty his mother and his lady Offence of mighty note but to himself The greatest wrong of all He lost a wife Whose beauty did astonish the survey Of richest eyes whose words all ears took captive Whose dear perfection hearts that scorn'd to serve Humbly call'd mistressPraising what is lost Makes the remembrance dear Well call him hither We are reconcil'd and the first view shall kill All repetition Let him not ask our pardon The nature of his great offence is dead And deeper than oblivion do we bury Th' incensing relics of it let him approach A stranger no offender and inform him So 'tis our will he shouldI shall my liegeWhat says he to your daughter Have you spokeAll that he is hath reference to your HighnessThen shall we have a match I have letters sent me That sets him high in fameHe looks well on 'tI am not a day of season For thou mayst see a sunshine and a hail In me at once But to the brightest beams Distracted clouds give way so stand thou forth The time is fair againMy highrepented blames Dear sovereign pardon to meAll is whole Not one word more of the consumed time Let's take the instant by the forward top For we are old and on our quick'st decrees Th' inaudible and noiseless foot of Time Steals ere we can effect them You remember The daughter of this lordAdmiringly my liege At first I stuck my choice upon her ere my heart Durst make too bold herald of my tongue Where the impression of mine eye infixing Contempt his scornful perspective did lend me Which warp'd the line of every other favour Scorn'd a fair colour or express'd it stol'n Extended or contracted all proportions To a most hideous object Thence it came That she whom all men prais'd and whom myself Since I have lost have lov'd was in mine eye The dust that did offend itWell excus'd That thou didst love her strikes some scores away From the great compt but love that comes too late Like a remorseful pardon slowly carried To the great sender turns a sour offence Crying 'That's good that's gone' Our rash faults Make trivial price of serious things we have Not knowing them until we know their grave Oft our displeasures to ourselves unjust Destroy our friends and after weep their dust Our own love waking cries to see what's done While shameful hate sleeps out the afternoon Be this sweet Helen's knell And now forget her Send forth your amorous token for fair Maudlin The main consents are had and here we'll stay To see our widower's second marriagedayWhich better than the first O dear heaven bless Or ere they meet in me O nature cesseCome on my son in whom my house's name Must be digested give a favour from you To sparkle in the spirits of my daughter That she may quickly come gives a ring By my old beard And ev'ry hair that's on 't Helen that's dead Was a sweet creature such a ring as this The last that e'er I took her leave at court I saw upon her fingerHers it was notNow pray you let me see it for mine eye While I was speaking oft was fasten'd to't This ring was mine and when I gave it Helen I bade her if her fortunes ever stood Necessitied to help that by this token I would relieve her Had you that craft to reave her Of what should stead her mostMy gracious sovereign Howe'er it pleases you to take it so The ring was never hersSon on my life I have seen her wear it and she reckon'd it At her life's rateI am sure I saw her wear itYou are deceiv'd my lord she never saw it In Florence was it from a casement thrown me Wrapp'd in a paper which contain'd the name Of her that threw it Noble she was and thought I stood engag'd but when I had subscrib'd To mine own fortune and inform'd her fully I could not answer in that course of honour As she had made the overture she ceas'd In heavy satisfaction and would never Receive the ring againPlutus himself That knows the tinct and multiplying med'cine Hath not in nature's mystery more science Than I have in this ring 'Twas mine 'twas Helen's Whoever gave it you Then if you know That you are well acquainted with yourself Confess 'twas hers and by what rough enforcement You got it from her She call'd the saints to surety That she would never put it from her finger Unless she gave it to yourself in bed Where you have never come or sent it us Upon her great disasterShe never saw itThou speak'st it falsely as I love mine honour And mak'st conjectural fears to come into me Which I would fain shut out If it should prove That thou art so inhuman 'twill not prove so And yet I know not thou didst hate her deadly And she is dead which nothing but to close Her eyes myself could win me to believe More than to see this ring Take him away seizeMy forepast proofs howe'er the matter fall Shall tax my fears of little vanity Having vainly fear'd too little Away with him We'll sift this matter furtherIf you shall prove This ring was ever hers you shall as easy Prove that I husbanded her

Either both or none To Your reputation comes too short for my daughter you are no husband for herMy lord this is a fond and desp'rate creature Whom sometime I have laugh'd with Let your Highness Lay a

He might have bought me at a common price Do not believe him o behold this ring Whose high respect and rich validity Did lack a parallel yet for all that He gave it to a commoner o' th' camp If I be oneHe blushes and 'tis it Of six preceding ancestors that gem Conferr'd by testament to th' sequent issue Hath it been ow'd and worn This is his wife That ring's a thousand proofsMethought you said You saw one here in court could witness itI did my lord but loath am to produce So bad an instrument his name's ParollesI saw the man today if man he beFind him and bring him hither an What of him

anythingShe hath that ring of yoursI think she has Certain it is I lik'd her And boarded her i' th' wanton way of youth She knew her distance and did angle for me Madding my eagerness with her restraint As all impediments in fancy's course Are motives of more fancy and in fine Her infinite cunning with her modern grace Subdu'd me to her rate She got the ring And I had that which any inferior might At marketprice have boughtI must be patient You that have turn'd off a first so noble wife May justly diet me I pray you yet Since you lack virtue I will lose a husband Send for your

did go between them as I said but more than that he loved herfor indeed he was mad for her and talk'd of Satan and of Limbo and of Furies and I know not what Yet I was in that credit with them at that time that I knew of their going to bed and of other motions as promising her marriage and things which would derive me ill will to speak of therefore I will not speak what I knowThou hast spoken all already unless thou canst say they are married but thou art too fine in thy evidence therefore stand aside This ring you say was yoursAy my good lordWhere did you buy it Or who gave it youIt was not
