Plight me the fun assurance of your faith That my most jealous and too doubtful soul May live at peace He shall conceal it Whiles you are willing it shall come to note What time we will our celebration keep According to my birth What do you sayI'll follow this good man and go with you And having sworn truth ever will be trueThen lead the way good father and heavens so shine That they may fairly note this act of mine
