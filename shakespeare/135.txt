 Athens and a wood near it Athens The palace ofand Now fair Hippolyta our nuptial hour Draws on apace four happy days bring in Another moon but O methinks how slow This old moon wanes She lingers my desires Like to a stepdame or a dowager Long withering out a young man's revenueFour days will quickly steep themselves in night Four nights will quickly dream away the time And then the moon like to a silver bow Newbent in heaven shall behold the night Of our solemnitiesGo Philostrate Stir up the Athenian youth to merriments Awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth Turn melancholy forth to funerals The pale companion is not for our pomp Hippolyta I woo'd thee with my sword And won thy love doing thee injuries But I will wed thee in another key With pomp with triumph and with revelling and his daughterand Happy be Theseus our renowned DukeThanks good Egeus what's the news with theeFull of vexation come I with complaint Against my child my daughter Hermia Stand forth Demetrius My noble lord This man hath my consent to marry her Stand forth Lysander And my gracious Duke This man hath bewitch'd the bosom of my child Thou thou Lysander thou hast given her rhymes And interchang'd lovetokens with my child Thou hast by moonlight at her window sung With feigning voice verses of feigning love And stol'n the impression of her fantasy With bracelets of thy hair rings gawds conceits Knacks trifles nosegays sweetmeats messengers Of strong prevailment in unhardened youth With cunning hast thou filch'd my daughter's heart Turn'd her obedience which is due to me To stubborn harshness And my gracious Duke Be it so she will not here before your Grace Consent to marry with Demetrius I beg the ancient privilege of Athens As she is mine I may dispose of her Which shall be either to this gentleman Or to her death according to our law Immediately provided in that caseWhat say you Hermia Be advis'd fair maid To you your father should be as a god One that compos'd your beauties yea and one To whom you are but as a form in wax By him imprinted and within his power To leave the figure or disfigure it Demetrius is a worthy gentlemanSo is LysanderIn himself he is But in this kind wanting your father's voice The other must be held the worthierI would my father look'd but with my eyesRather your eyes must with his judgment lookI do entreat your Grace to pardon me I know not by what power I am made bold Nor how it may concern my modesty In such a presence here to plead my thoughts But I beseech your Grace that I may know The worst that may befall me in this case If I refuse to wed DemetriusEither to die the death or to abjure For ever the society of men Therefore fair Hermia question your desires Know of your youth examine well your blood Whether if you yield not to your father's choice You can endure the livery of a nun For aye to be shady cloister mew'd To live a barren sister all your life Chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon Thriceblessed they that master so their blood To undergo such maiden pilgrimage But earthlier happy is the rose distill'd Than that which withering on the virgin thorn Grows lives and dies in single blessednessSo will I grow so live so die my lord Ere I will yield my virgin patent up Unto his lordship whose unwished yoke My soul consents not to give sovereigntyTake time to pause and by the next new moon The sealingday betwixt my love and me For everlasting bond of fellowship Upon that day either prepare to die For disobedience to your father's will Or else to wed Demetrius as he would Or on Diana's altar to protest For aye austerity and single lifeRelent sweet Hermia and Lysander yield Thy crazed title to my certain rightYou have her father's love Demetrius Let me have Hermia's do you marry himScornful Lysander true he hath my love And what is mine my love shall render him And she is mine and all my right of her I do estate unto DemetriusI am my lord as well deriv'd as he As well possess'd my love is more than his My fortunes every way as fairly rank'd If not with vantage as Demetrius' And which is more than all these boasts can be I am belov'd of beauteous Hermia Why should not I then prosecute my right Demetrius I'll avouch it to his head Made love to Nedar's daughter Helena And won her soul and she sweet lady dotes Devoutly dotes dotes in idolatry Upon this spotted and inconstant manI must confess that I have heard so much And with Demetrius thought to have spoke thereof But being overfull of selfaffairs My mind did lose it But Demetrius come And come Egeus you shall go with me I have some private schooling for you both For you fair Hermia look you arm yourself To fit your fancies to your father's will Or else the law of Athens yields you up Which by no means we may extenuate To death or to a vow of single life Come my Hippolyta what cheer my love Demetrius and Egeus go along I must employ you in some business Against our nuptial and confer with you Of something nearly that concerns yourselvesWith duty and desire we follow youall but and How now my love Why is your cheek so pale How chance the roses there do fade so fastBelike for want of rain which I could well Beteem them from the tempest of my eyesAy me for aught that I could ever read Could ever hear by tale or history The course of true love never did run smooth But either it was different in bloodO cross too high to be enthrall'd to lowOr else misgraffed in respect of yearsO spite too old to be engag'd to youngOr else it stood upon the choice of friendsO hell to choose love by another's eyesOr if there were a sympathy in choice War death or sickness did lay siege to it Making it momentary as a sound Swift as a shadow short as any dream Brief as the lightning in the collied night That in a spleen unfolds both heaven and earth And ere a man hath power to say 'Behold' The jaws of darkness do devour it up So quick bright things come to confusionIf then true lovers have ever cross'd It stands as an edict in destiny Then let us teach our trial patience Because it is a customary cross As due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs Wishes and tears poor Fancy's followersA good persuasion therefore hear me Hermia I have a widow aunt a dowager Of great revenue and she hath no child From Athens is her house remote seven leagues And she respects me as her only son There gentle Hermia may I marry thee And to that place the sharp Athenian law Cannot pursue us If thou lovest me then Steal forth thy father's house tomorrow night And in the wood a league without the town Where I did meet thee once with Helena To do observance to a morn of May There will I stay for theeMy good Lysander I swear to thee by Cupid's strongest bow By his best arrow with the golden head By the simplicity of Venus' doves By that which knitteth souls and prospers loves And by that fire which burn'd the Carthage Queen When the false Troyan under sail was seen By all the vows that ever men have broke In number more than ever women spoke In that same place thou hast appointed me Tomorrow truly will I meet with theeKeep promise love Look here comes Helena God speed fair Helena Whither awayCall you me fair That fair again unsay Demetrius loves your fair O happy fair Your eyes are lodestars and your tongue's sweet air More tuneable than lark to shepherd's ear When wheat is green when hawthorn buds appear Sickness is catching O were favour so Yours would I catch fair Hermia ere I go My ear should catch your voice my eye your eye My tongue should catch your tongue's sweet melody Were the world mine Demetrius being bated The rest I'd give to be to you translated O teach me how you look and with what art You sway the motion of Demetrius' heartI frown upon him yet he loves me stillO that your frowns would teach my smiles such skillI give him curses yet he gives me loveO that my prayers could such affection moveThe more I hate the more he follows meThe more I love the more he hateth meHis folly Helena is no fault of mineNone but your beauty would that fault were mineTake comfort he no more shall see my face Lysander and myself will fly this place Before the time I did Lysander see Seem'd Athens as a paradise to me O then what graces in my love do dwell That he hath turn'd a heaven unto a hellHelen to you our minds we will unfold Tomorrow night when Phoebe doth behold Her silver visage in the wat'ry glass Decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass A time that lovers' flights doth still conceal Through Athens' gates have we devis'd to stealAnd in the wood where often you and I Upon faint primrose beds were wont to lie Emptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet There my Lysander and myself shall meet And thence from Athens turn away our eyes To seek new friends and stranger companies Farewell sweet playfellow pray thou for us And good luck grant thee thy Demetrius Keep word Lysander we must starve our sight From lovers' food till morrow deep midnightI will my Hermia Helena adieu As you on him Demetrius dote on you How happy some o'er other some can be Through Athens I am thought as fair as she But what of that Demetrius thinks not so He will not know what all but he do know And as he errs doting on Hermia's eyes So I admiring of his qualities Things base and vile holding no quantity Love can transpose to form and dignity Love looks not with the eyes but with the mind And therefore is wing'd Cupid painted blind Nor hath Love's mind of any judgment taste Wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste And therefore is Love said to be a child Because in choice he is so oft beguil'd As waggish boys in game themselves forswear So the boy Love is perjur'd everywhere For ere Demetrius look'd on Hermia's eyne He hail'd down oaths that he was only mine And when this hail some heat from Hermia felt So he dissolv'd and show'rs of oaths did melt I will go tell him of fair Hermia's flight Then to the wood will he tomorrow night Pursue her and for this intelligence If I have thanks it is a dear expense But herein mean I to enrich my pain To have his sight thither and back again Athenshouseand Is all our company hereYou were best to call them generally man by man
