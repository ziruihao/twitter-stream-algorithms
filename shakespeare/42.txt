question to thee If thou answerest me not to the purpose confess thyself Other Go to Clown What is he that builds stronger than either the mason the shipwright or the carp Other The gallowsmaker for that frame outlives a thousand tenants Clown I like thy wit well in good faith The gallows does well But how does it well It does well to those that do ill Now thou dost ill to say the gallows is built stronger than the church Argal the gallows may do well to thee To't again come Other Who builds stronger than a mason a shipwright or a carp Clown Ay tell me that and unyoke Other Marry now I

was very sweetTo contract O the time for a my behoveO methought there a was nothing a meet Ham Has this fellow no feeling of his business that he sings at gravemaking Hor Custom hath made it in him a Property of easiness Ham 'Tis e'en so The hand of little employment hath the daintier sense Clown singsBut age with his stealing stepsHath clawed me in his clutchAnd hath shipped me intil the landAs if I had never been such Throws up a skull Ham That skull had a tongue in it and could sing once How the knave jowls it to the groundas if 'twere Cain's jawbone that did the first murther This might be the pate of a Politician which this ass now o'erreaches one that would circumvent God might it not Hor It might my lord Ham Or of a courtier which could say 'Good morrow sweet lord How dost thou good lord' This might be my Lord Suchaone that prais'd my Lord Suchaone's horse when he meant to beg it might it not Hor Ay my lord Ham Why e'en so and now my Lady Worm's chapless and knock'd about the mazzard with a sexton's spade Here's fine revolution and we had the trick to see't Did these bones cost no more the breeding but to play at loggets with 'em Mine ache to think on't Clown SingsA pickaxe and a spade a spadeFor and a shrouding sheetO a Pit of clay for to be madeFor such a guest is meet Throws up another skull Ham There's another Why may not that be the skull of a lawyer Where be his quiddits now his quillets his cases his tenures and his tricks Why does he suffer this rude knave now to knock him about the sconce with a dirty shovel and will not tell him of his action of battery Hum This fellow might be in's time a great buyer of land with his statutes his recognizances his fines his double vouchers his recoveries Is this the fine of his fines and the recovery of his recoveries to have his fine pate full of fine dirt Will his vouchers vouch him no more of his purchases and double ones too than the length and breadth of a pair of indentures The very conveyances of his lands will scarcely lie in this box and must th' inheritor himself have no more ha Hor Not a jot more my lord Ham Is not parchment made of sheepskins Hor Ay my lord And of calveskins too Ham They are sheep and calves which seek out assurance in that I will speak to this fellow Whose grave's this sirrah Clown Mine sir Sings O a pit of clay for to be made For such a guest is meet Ham I think it

neither Ham Who is to be buried in't Clown One that was a woman sir but rest her soul she's dead Ham How absolute the knave is We must speak by the card or equivocation will undo us By the Lord Horatio this three years I have taken note of it the age is grown so picked that the toe of the peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier he galls his kibe How long hast thou been a gravemaker Clown Of all the days i' th' year I came to't that day that our last king Hamlet overcame Fortinbras Ham How long is that since Clown Cannot you tell that Every fool can tell that It was the very day that young Hamlet was born he that is mad and sent into England Ham Ay marry why was be sent into England Clown Why because 'a was mad 'A shall recover his wits there or if 'a do not 'tis no great matter there Ham Why Clown 'Twill not he seen in him there There the men are as mad as he Ham How came he mad Clown Very strangely they say Ham How strangely Clown Faith e'en with losing his wits Ham Upon what ground Clown Why here in Denmark I have been sexton here man and boy thirty years Ham How long will a man lie i' th' earth ere he rot Clown Faith if 'a be not rotten before 'a die as we have many pocky corses nowadays that will scarce hold the laying in I will last you some eight year or nine year A tanner will last you nine year Ham Why he more than another Clown Why sir his hide is so tann'd with his trade that 'a will keep out water a great while and your water is a sore decayer of your whoreson dead body Here's a skull now This skull hath lien you i' th' earth threeandtwenty years Ham Whose was it Clown A whoreson mad fellow's it was Whose do you think it was Ham Nay I know not Clown A pestilence on him for a mad rogue 'A pour'd a flagon of Rhenish on my head once This same skull sir was Yorick's skull the King's jester Ham This Clown E'en that Ham Let me see Takes the skull Alas poor Yorick I knew him Horatio A fellow of infinite jest of most excellent fancy He hath borne me on his back a thousand tunes And now how abhorred in my imagination it is My gorge rises at it Here hung those lips that I have kiss'd I know not how oft Where be your gibes now your gambols your songs your flashes of merriment that were wont to set the table on a roar Not one now to mock your own grinning Quite chap fall'n Now get you to my lady's chamber and tell her let her paint an inch thick to this favour she must come Make her laugh at that Prithee Horatio tell me one thing Hor What's that my lord Ham Dost thou think Alexander look'd o' this fashion i' th' earth Hor E'en so Ham And smelt so Pah Puts down the skull Hor E'en so my lord Ham To what base uses we may return Horatio Why may not imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander till he find it stopping a bunghole Hor 'Twere to consider too curiously to consider so Ham No faith not a jot but to follow him thither with modesty enough and likelihood to lead it as thus Alexander died Alexander was buried Alexander returneth into dust the dust is earth of earth we make loam and why of that loam whereto he was converted might they not stop a beer barrel Imperious Caesar dead and turn'd to clay Might stop a hole to keep the wind away O that that earth which kept the world in awe Should patch a wall t' expel the winter's flaw But soft but soft aside Here comes the Kingpriests with a coffin in funeral procession KingQueen Laertes with Lords attendant The Queen the courtiers Who is this they follow And with such maimed rites This doth betoken The corse they follow did with desp'rate hand Fordo it own life 'Twas of some estate Couch we awhile and markRetires with Horatio Laer What ceremony else Ham That is Laertes A very noble youth Mark Laer What ceremony else Priest Her obsequies have been as far enlarg'd As we have warranty Her death was doubtful And but that great command o'ersways the order She should in ground unsanctified have lodg'd Till the last trumpet For charitable prayers Shards flints and pebbles should be thrown on her Yet here she is allow'd her virgin crants Her maiden strewments and the bringing home Of bell and burial Laer Must there no more be done Priest No more be done We should profane the service of the dead To sing a requiem and such rest to her As to peaceparted souls Laer Lay her i' th' earth And from her fair and unpolluted flesh May violets spring I tell thee churlish priest A minist'ring angel shall my sister be When thou liest howling Ham What the fair Ophelia Queen Sweets to the sweet FarewellScatters flowers I hop'd thou shouldst have been my Hamlet's wife I thought thy bridebed to have deck'd sweet maid And not have strew'd thy grave Laer O treble woe Fall ten times treble on that cursed head Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense Depriv'd thee of Hold off the earth awhile Till I have caught her once more in mine armsLeaps in the grave Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead Till of this flat a mountain you have made T' o'ertop old Pelion or the skyish head Of blue Olympus Ham comes forward What is he whose grief Bears such an emphasis whose phrase of sorrow Conjures the wand'ring stars and makes them stand Like wonderwounded hearers This is I Hamlet the DaneLeaps in after Laertes Laer The devil take thy soul Grapples with him Ham Thou pray'st not well I prithee take thy fingers from my throat For though I am not splenitive and rash Yet have I in me something dangerous Which let thy wisdom fear Hold off thy hand King Pluck thein asunder Queen Hamlet Hamlet All Gentlemen Hor Good my lord be quietThe Attendants part them and they come out of thegrave Ham Why I will fight with him upon this theme Until my eyelids will no longer wag Queen O my son what theme Ham I lov'd Ophelia Forty thousand brothers Could not with all their quantity of love Make up my sum What wilt thou do for her King O he is mad Laertes Queen For love of God forbear him Ham wounds show me what thou't do Woo't weep woo't fight woo't fast woo't tear thyself Woo't drink up esill eat a crocodile I'll do't Dost thou come here to whine To outface me with leaping in her grave Be buried quick with her and so willAnd if thou prate of mountains let them throw Millions of acres on us till our ground Singeing his pate against the burning zone Make Ossa like a wart Nay an thou'lt mouth I'll rant as well as thou Queen This is mere madness And thus a while the fit will work on him Anon as patient as the female dove When that her golden couplets are disclos'd His silence will sit drooping Ham Hear you sir What is the reason that you use me thus I lov'd you ever But it is no matter Let Hercules himself do what he may The cat will mew and dog will have his dayKing I pray thee good Horatio wait upon him Horatio To Laertes Strengthen your patience in our last night's speech We'll put the matter to the present push Good Gertrude set some watch over your son This grave shall have a living monument An hour of quiet shortly shall we see Till then in patience our proceeding beSceneElsinore A hall in the CastleHamlet and Horatio Ham So much for this sir now shall you see the other You do remember all the circumstance Hor Remember it my lord Ham Sir in my heart there was a kind of fighting That would not let me sleep Methought I lay Worse than the mutinies in the bilboes Rashly And prais'd be rashness for it let us know Our indiscretion sometime serves us well When our deep plots do pall and that should learn us There's a divinity that shapes our ends Roughhew them how we will Hor That is most certain Ham Up from my cabin My seagown scarf'd about me in the dark Grop'd I to find out them had my desire Finger'd their packet and in fine withdrew To mine own room again making so bold My fears forgetting manners to unseal Their grand commission where I found Horatio O royal knavery an exact command Larded with many several sorts of reasons Importing Denmark's health and England's too With hoo such bugs and goblins in my life That on the supervise no leisure bated No not to stay the finding of the axe My head should be struck off Hor Is't possible Ham Here's the commission read it at more leisure But wilt thou bear me how I did proceed Hor I beseech you Ham Being thus benetted round with villanies Or I could make a prologue to my brains They had begun the play I sat me down Devis'd a new commission wrote it fair I once did hold it as our statists do A baseness to write fair and labour'd much How to forget that learning but sir now It did me yeoman's service Wilt thou know Th' effect of what I wrote Hor Ay good my lord Ham An earnest conjuration from the King As England was his faithful tributary As love between them like the palm might flourish As peace should still her wheaten garland wear And stand a comma 'tween their amities And many suchlike as's of great charge That on the view and knowing of these contents Without debatement further more or less He should the bearers put to sudden death Not shriving time allow'd Hor How was this seal'd Ham Why even in that was heaven ordinant I had my father's signet in my purse which was the model of that Danish seal Folded the writ up in the form of th' other Subscrib'd it gave't th' impression plac'd it safely The changeling never known Now the next day Was our seafight and what to this was sequent Thou know'st already Hor So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to't Ham Why man they did make love to this employment They are not near my conscience their defeat Does by their own insinuation grow 'Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes Between the pass and fell incensed points Of mighty opposites Hor Why what a king is this Ham Does it not thinks't thee stand me now upon He that hath kill'd my king and whor'd my mother Popp'd in between th' election and my hopes Thrown out his angle for my Proper life And with such coz'nage is't not perfect conscience To quit him with this arm And is't not to be damn'd To let this canker of our nature come In further evil Hor It must be shortly known to him from England What is the issue of the business there Ham It will be short the interim is mine And a man's life is no more than to say 'one' But I am very sorry good Horatio That to Laertes I forgot myself For by the image of my cause I see The portraiture of his I'll court his favours But sure the bravery of his grief did put me Into a tow'ring passion Hor Peace Who comes here young Osric a courtier Osr Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark Ham I humbly thank you sir Aside to Horatio Dost know this waterfly Hor aside to Hamlet No my good lord Ham aside to Horatio Thy state is the more gracious for 'tis a vice to know him He hath much land and fertile Let a beast be lord of beasts and his crib shall stand at the king's mess 'Tis a chough but as I say spacious in the possession of dirt Osr Sweet lord if your lordship were at leisure I should impart a thing to you from his Majesty Ham I will receive it sir with all diligence of spirit Put your bonnet to his right use 'Tis for the head Osr I thank your lordship it is very hot Ham No believe me 'tis very cold the wind is northerly Osr It is indifferent cold my lord indeed Ham But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my complexion Osr Exceedingly my lord it is very sultry as 'twere I cannot tell how But my lord his Majesty bade me signify to you that he has laid a great wager on your head Sir this is the matter Ham I beseech you rememberHamlet moves him to put on his hat Osr Nay good my lord for mine ease in good faith Sir here is newly come to court Laertes believe me an absolute gentleman full of most excellent differences of very soft society and great showing Indeed to speak feelingly of him he is the card or calendar of gentry for you shall find in him the continent of what part a gentleman would see Ham Sir his definement suffers no perdition in you though I know to divide him inventorially would dozy th' arithmetic of memory and yet but yaw neither in respect of his quick sail But in the verity of extolment I take him to be a soul of great article and his infusion of such dearth and rareness as to make true diction of him his semblable is his mirror and who else would trace him his umbrage nothing more Osr Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him Ham The concernancy sir Why do we wrap the gentleman in our more rawer breath Osr Sir Hor aside to Hamlet Is't not possible to understand in another tongue You will do't sir really Ham What imports the nomination of this gentleman Osr Of Laertes Hor aside His purse is empty already All's golden words are spent Ham Of him sir Osr I know you are not ignorant Ham I would you did sir yet in faith if you did it would not much approve me Well sir Osr You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is Ham I dare not confess that lest I should compare with him in excellence but to know a man well were to know himself Osr I mean sir for his weapon but in the imputation laid on him by them in his meed he's unfellowed Ham What's his weapon Osr Rapier and dagger Ham That's two of his weapons but well Osr The King sir hath wager'd with him six Barbary horses against the which he has impon'd as I take it six French rapiers and poniards with their assigns as girdle hangers and so Three of the carriages in faith are very dear to fancy very responsive to the hilts most delicate carriages and of very liberal conceit Ham What call you the carriages Hor aside to Hamlet I knew you must be edified by the margent ere you had done Osr The carriages sir are the hangers Ham The phrase would be more germane to the matter if we could carry cannon by our sides I would it might be hangers till then But on Six Barbary horses against six French swords their assigns and three liberalconceited carriages that's the French bet against the Danish Why is this all impon'd as you call it Osr The King sir hath laid that in a dozen passes between yourself and him he shall not exceed you three hits he hath laid on twelve for nine and it would come to immediate trial if your lordship would vouchsafe the answer Ham How if I answer no Osr I mean my lord the opposition of your person in trial Ham Sir I will walk here in the hall If it please his Majesty it is the breathing time of day with me Let the foils be brought the gentleman willing and the King hold his purpose I will win for him if I can if not I will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits Osr Shall I redeliver you e'en so Ham To this effect sir after what flourish your nature will Osr I commend my duty to your lordship Ham Yours yoursOsric He does well to commend it himself there are no tongues else for's turn Hor This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head Ham He did comply with his dug before he suck'd it Thus has he and many more of the same bevy that I know the drossy age dotes on only got the tune of the time and outward habit of encounter a kind of yesty collection which carries them through and through the most fann'd and winnowed opinions and do but blow them to their trialthe bubbles are outa Lord Lord My lord his Majesty commended him to you by young Osric who brings back to him that you attend him in the hall He sends to know if your pleasure hold to play with Laertes or that you will take longer time Ham I am constant to my purposes they follow the King's pleasure If his fitness speaks mine is ready now or whensoever provided I be so able as now Lord The King and Queen and all are coming down Ham In happy time Lord The Queen desires you to use some gentle tainment to Laertes before you fall to play Ham She well instructs meLord Hor You will lose this wager my lord Ham I do not think so Since he went into France I have been in continual practice I shall win at the odds But thou wouldst not think how ill all's here about my heart But it is no matter Hor Nay good my lordHam It is but foolery but it is such a kind of gaingiving as would perhaps trouble a woman Hor If your mind dislike anything obey it I will forestall their repair hither and say you are not fit Ham Not a whit we defy augury there's a special providence in the fall of a sparrow If it be now 'tis not to come' if it be not to come it will be now if it be not now yet it will come the readiness is all Since no man knows aught of what he leaves what is't to leave betimes Let beKing Queen Laertes Osric and Lords with other Attendants with foils and gauntletsA table and flagons of wine on it King Come Hamlet come and take this hand from me The King puts Laertes' hand into Hamlet's Ham Give me your pardon sir I have done you wrong But pardon't as you are a gentleman This presence knows And you must needs have heard how I am punish'd With sore distraction What I have done That might your nature honour and exception Roughly awake I here proclaim was madness Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes Never Hamlet If Hamlet from himself be taken away And when he's not himself does wrong Laertes Then Hamlet does it not Hamlet denies it Who does it then His madness If't be so Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong'd His madness is poor Hamlet's enemy Sir in this audience Let my disclaiming from a purpos'd evil Free me so far in your most generous thoughts That I have shot my arrow o'er the house And hurt my brother Laer I am satisfied in nature Whose motive in this case should stir me most To my revenge But in my terms of honour I stand aloof and will no reconcilement Till by some elder masters of known honour I have a voice and precedent of peace To keep my name ungor'd But till that time I do receive your offer'd love like love And will not wrong it Ham I embrace it freely And will this brother's wager frankly play Give us the foils Come on Laer Come one for me Ham I'll be your foil Laertes In mine ignorance Your skill shall like a star i' th' darkest night Stick fiery off indeed Laer You mock me sir Ham No by this bad King Give them the foils young Osric Cousin Hamlet You know the wager Ham Very well my lord Your Grace has laid the odds o' th' weaker side King I do not fear it I have seen you both But since he is better'd we have therefore odds Laer This is too heavy let me see another Ham This likes me well These foils have all a length Prepare to play Osr Ay my good lord King Set me the stoups of wine upon that table If Hamlet give the first or second hit Or quit in answer of the third exchange Let all the battlements their ordnance fire The King shall drink to Hamlet's better breath And in the cup an union shall he throw Richer than that which four successive kings In Denmark's crown have worn Give me the cups And let the kettle to the trumpet speak The trumpet to the cannoneer without The cannons to the heavens the heaven to earth 'Now the King drinks to Hamlet' Come begin And you the judges bear a wary eye Ham Come on sir Laer Come my lordThey play Ham One Laer No Ham Judgment Osr A hit a very palpable hit Laer Well again King Stay give me drink Hamlet this pearl is thine Here's to thy healthDrum trumpets sound a piece goes off within Give him the cup Ham I'll play this bout first set it by awhile Come They play Another hit What say you Laer A touch a touch I do confess't King Our son shall win Queen He's fat and scant of breath Here Hamlet take my napkin rub thy brows The Queen carouses to thy fortune Hamlet Ham Good madam King Gertrude do not drink Queen I will my lord I pray you pardon meDrinks King aside It is the poison'd cup it is too late Ham I dare not drink yet madam byandby Queen Come let me wipe thy face Laer My lord I'll hit him now King I do not think't Laer aside And yet it is almost against my conscience Ham Come for the third Laertes You but dally pray You Pass with your best violence I am afeard You make a wanton of me Laer Say you so Come on Play Osr Nothing neither way Laer Have at you now Laertes wounds Hamlet then in scuffling they change rapiers and Hamlet wounds Laertes King Part them They are incens'd Ham Nay come again The Queen falls Osr Look to the Queen there ho Hor They bleed on both sides How is it my lord Osr How is't Laertes Laer Why as a woodcock to mine own springe Osric I am justly kill'd with mine own treachery Ham How does the Queen King She sounds to see them bleed Queen No no the drink the drink O my dear Hamlet The drink the drink I am poison'd Dies Ham O villany Ho let the door be lock'd Treachery Seek it out Laertes falls Laer It is here Hamlet Hamlet thou art slain No medicine in the world can do thee good In thee there is not half an hour of life The treacherous instrument is in thy hand Unbated and envenom'd The foul practice Hath turn'd itself on me Lo here I lie Never to rise again Thy mother's poison'd I can no more The King the King's to blame Ham The point envenom'd too Then venom to thy workHurts the King All Treason treason King O yet defend me friends I am but hurt Ham Here thou incestuous murd'rous damned Dane Drink off this potion Is thy union here Follow my mother King dies Laer He is justly serv'd It is a poison temper'd by himself Exchange forgiveness with me noble Hamlet Mine and my father's death come not upon thee Nor thine on me Dies Ham Heaven make thee free of it I follow thee I am dead Horatio Wretched queen adieu You that look pale and tremble at this chance That are but mutes or audience to this act Had I but time as this fell sergeant Death Is strict in his arrest O I could tell you But let it be Horatio I am dead Thou liv'st report me and my cause aright To the unsatisfied Hor Never believe it I am more an antique Roman than a Dane Here's yet some liquor left Ham As th'art a man Give me the cup Let go By heaven I'll ha't O good Horatio what a wounded name Things standing thus unknown shall live behind me If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart Absent thee from felicity awhile And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain To tell my story March afar off and shot within What warlike noise is this Osr Young Fortinbras with conquest come from Poland To the ambassadors of England gives This warlike volley Ham O I die Horatio The potent poison quite o'ercrows my spirit I cannot live to hear the news from England But I do prophesy th' election lights On Fortinbras He has my dying voice So tell him with th' occurrents more and less Which have solicited the rest is silence Dies Hor Now cracks a noble heart Good night sweet prince And flights of angels sing thee to thy restMarch within Why does the drum come hitherFortinbras and English Ambassadors with Drum Colours and Attendants Fort Where is this sight Hor What is it you will see If aught of woe or wonder cease your search Fort This quarry cries on havoc O proud Death What feast is toward in thine eternal cell That thou so many princes at a shot So bloodily hast struck Ambassador The sight is dismal And our affairs from England come too late The ears are senseless that should give us bearing To tell him his commandment is fulfill'd That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead Where should We have our thanks Hor Not from his mouth Had it th' ability of life to thank you He never gave commandment for their death But since so jump upon this bloody question You from the Polack wars and you from England Are here arriv'd give order that these bodies High on a stage be placed to the view And let me speak to the yet unknowing world How these things came about So shall You hear Of carnal bloody and unnatural acts Of accidental judgments casual slaughters Of deaths put on by cunning and forc'd cause And in this upshot purposes mistook Fall'n on th' inventors' heads All this can I Truly deliver Fort Let us haste to hear it And call the noblest to the audience For me with sorrow I embrace my fortune I have some rights of memory in this kingdom Which now to claim my vantage doth invite me Hor Of that I shall have also cause to speak And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more But let this same be presently perform'd Even while men's minds are wild lest more mischance On plots and errors happen Fort Let four captains Bear Hamlet like a soldier to the stage For he was likely had he been put on To have prov'd most royally and for his passage The soldiers' music and the rites of war Speak loudly for him Take up the bodies Such a sight as this Becomes the field but here shows much amiss Go bid the soldiers shootmarching after the which a peal of ordnanceare shot off
