Albeit they were flesh'd villains bloody dogs Melted with tenderness and mild compassion Wept like two children in their deaths' sad story 'O thus' quoth Dighton 'lay the gentle babes' 'Thus thus' quoth Forrest 'girdling one another Within their alabaster innocent arms Their lips were four red roses on a stalk And in their summer beauty kiss'd each other A book of prayers on their pillow lay Which once' quoth Forrest 'almost chang'd my mind But O the devil'there the villain stopp'd When Dighton thus told on 'We smothered The most replenished sweet work of nature That from the prime

mourn but weSitting down by her Coming forwardIf ancient sorrow be most reverend Give mine the benefit of seniory And let my griefs frown on the upper hand If sorrow can admit societySitting down with them Tell o'er your woes again by viewing mine I had an Edward till a Richard kill'd him I had a husband till a Richard kill'd him Thou hadst an Edward till a Richard kill'd him Thou hadst a Richard till a Richard kill'd himI had a Richard too and thou didst kill him I had a Rutland too thou holp'st to kill himThou hadst a Clarence too and Richard kill'd him From forth the kennel of thy womb hath crept A hellhound that doth hunt us all to death That dog that had his teeth before his eyes To worry lambs and lap their gentle blood That foul defacer of God's handiwork That excellent grand tyrant of the earth That reigns in galled eyes of weeping souls Thy womb let loose to chase us to our graves O upright just and truedisposing God How do I thank thee that this carnal cur Preys on the issue of his mother's body And makes her pewfellow with others' moanO Harry's wife triumph not in my woes God witness with me I have wept for thineBear with me I am hungry for revenge And now I cloy me with beholding it Thy Edward he is dead that kill'd my Edward The other Edward dead to quit my Edward Young York he is but boot because both they Match'd not the high perfection of my loss Thy Clarence he is dead that stabb'd my Edward And the beholders of this frantic play Th' adulterate Hastings Rivers Vaughan Grey Untimely smother'd in their dusky graves Richard yet lives hell's black intelligencer Only reserv'd their factor to buy souls And send them thither But at hand at hand Ensues his piteous and unpitied end Earth gapes hell burns fiends roar saints pray To have him suddenly convey'd from hence Cancel his bond of life dear God I pray That I may live and say 'The dog is dead'O thou didst prophesy the time would come That I should wish for thee to help me curse That bottled spider that foul bunchback'd toadI Call'd thee then vain flourish of my fortune I call'd thee then poor shadow painted queen The presentation of but what I was The flattering index of a direful pageant One heav'd ahigh to be hurl'd down below A mother only mock'd with two fair babes A dream of what thou wast a garish flag To be the aim of every dangerous shot A sign of dignity a breath a bubble A queen in jest only to fill the scene Where is thy husband now Where be thy brothers Where be thy two sons Wherein dost thou joy Who sues and kneels and says 'God save the Queen' Where be the bending peers that flattered thee Where be the thronging troops that followed thee Decline an this and see what now thou art For happy wife a most distressed widow For joyful mother one that wails the name For one being su'd to one that humbly sues For Queen a very caitiff crown'd with care For she that scorn'd at me now scorn'd of me For she being fear'd of all now fearing one For she commanding all obey'd of none Thus hath the course of justice whirl'd about And left thee but a very prey to time Having no more but thought of what thou wast To torture thee the more being what thou art Thou didst usurp my place and dost thou not Usurp the just proportion of my sorrow Now thy proud neck bears half my burden'd yoke From which even here I slip my weary head And leave the burden of it all on thee Farewell York's wife and queen of sad mischance These English woes shall make me smile in FranceO thou well skill'd in curses stay awhile And teach me how to curse mine enemiesForbear to sleep the nights and fast the days Compare dead happiness with living woe Think that thy babes were sweeter than they were And he that slew them fouler than he is Bett'ring thy loss makes the badcauser worse Revolving this will teach thee how to curseMy words are dull O quicken them with thineThy woes will make them sharp and pierce like mine Why should calamity be fun of wordsWindy attorneys to their client woes Airy succeeders of intestate joys Poor breathing orators of miseries Let them have scope though what they will impart Help nothing else yet do they case the heartIf so then be not tonguetied Go with me And in the breath of bitter words let's smother My damned son that thy two sweet sons smother'd The trumpet sounds be copious in exclaims and his train marching withdrums and trumpetsWho intercepts me in my expeditionO she that might have intercepted thee By strangling thee in her accursed womb From all the slaughters wretch that thou hast doneHidest thou that forehead with a golden crown Where't should be branded if that right were right The slaughter of the Prince that ow'd that crown And the dire death of my poor sons and brothers Tell me thou villain slave where are my childrenThou toad

companyFaith none but Humphrey Hour that call'd your Grace To breakfast once forth of my company If I be so disgracious in your eye Let me march on and not offend you madam Strike up the drumI prithee hear me speakYou speak too bitterlyHear me a word For I shall never speak to thee againSoEither thou wilt die by God's just ordinance Ere from this war thou turn a conqueror Or I with grief and extreme age shall perish And never more behold thy face again Therefore take with thee my most grievous curse Which in the day of battle tire thee more Than all the complete armour that thou wear'st My prayers on the adverse party fight And there the little souls of Edward's children Whisper the spirits of thine enemies And promise them success and victory Bloody thou art bloody will be thy end Shame serves thy life and doth thy death attendThough far more cause yet much less spirit to curse Abides in me I say amen to herStay madam I must talk a word with youI have no moe sons of the royal blood For thee to slaughter For my daughters Richard They shall be praying nuns not weeping queens And therefore level not to hit their livesYou have a daughter call'd Elizabeth Virtuous and fair royal and graciousAnd must she die for this O let her live And I'll corrupt her manners stain her beauty Slander myself as false to Edward's bed Throw over her the veil of infamy So she may live unscarr'd of bleeding slaughter I will confess she was not Edward's daughterWrong not her birth she is a royal PrincessTo save her life I'll say she is not soHer life is safest only in her birthAnd only in that safety died her brothersLo at their birth good stars were oppositeNo to their lives ill friends were contraryAll unavoided is the doom of destinyTrue when avoided grace makes destiny My

freedom life Whose hand soever lanc'd their tender hearts Thy head an indirectly gave direction No doubt the murd'rous knife was dull and blunt Till it was whetted on thy stonehard heart To revel in the entrails of my lambs But that stiff use of grief makes wild grief tame My tongue should to thy ears not name my boys Till that my nails were anchor'd in thine eyes And I in such a desp'rate bay of death Like a poor bark of sails and tackling reft Rush all to pieces on thy rocky bosomMadam so thrive I in my prise And dangerous success of bloody wars As I intend more good to you and yours Than
