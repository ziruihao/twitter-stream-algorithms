Westminster The palacethe in his nightgown with a pageGo call the Earls of Surrey and of Warwick But ere they come bid them o'erread these letters And well consider of them Make good speed page How many thousands of my poorest subjects Are at this hour asleep O sleep O gentle sleep Nature's soft nurse how have I frightened thee That thou no more will weigh my eyelids down And steep my senses in forgetfulness Why rather sleep liest thou in smoky cribs Upon uneasy pallets stretching thee And hush'd with buzzing nightflies to thy slumber Than in the perfum'd chambers of the great Under the canopies of costly state And lull'd with sound of sweetest melody O thou dull god why liest thou with the vile In loathsome beds and leav'st the kingly couch A watchcase or a common 'larumbell Wilt thou upon the high and giddy mast Seal up the shipboy's eyes and rock his brains In cradle of the rude imperious surge And in the visitation of the winds Who take the ruffian billows by the top Curling their monstrous heads and hanging them With deafing clamour in the slippery clouds That with the hurly death itself awakes Canst thou O partial sleep give thy repose To the wet seaboy in an hour so rude And in the calmest and most stillest night With all appliances and means to boot Deny it to a king Then happy low lie down Uneasy lies the head that wears a crownand SurreyMany good morrows to your MajestyIs it good morrow lords'Tis one o'clock and pastWhy then good morrow to you all my lords Have you read o'er the letters that I sent youWe have my liegeThen you perceive the body of our kingdom How foul it is what rank diseases grow And with what danger near the heart of itIt is but as a body yet distempered Which to his former strength may be restored With good advice and little medicine My Lord Northumberland will soon be cool'dO God that one might read the book of fate And see the revolution of the times Make mountains level and the continent Weary of solid firmness melt itself Into the sea and other times to see The beachy girdle of the ocean Too wide for Neptune's hips how chances mock And changes fill the cup of alteration With divers liquors O if this were seen The happiest youth viewing his progress through What perils past what crosses to ensue Would shut the book and sit him down and die 'Tis not ten years gone Since Richard and Northumberland great friends Did feast together and in two years after Were they at wars It is but eight years since This Percy was the man nearest my soul Who like a brother toil'd in my affairs And laid his love and life under my foot Yea for my sake even to the eyes of Richard Gave him defiance But which of you was by To You cousin Nevil as I may remember When Richard with his eye brim full of tears Then check'd and rated by Northumberland Did speak these words now prov'd a prophecy 'Northumberland thou ladder by the which My cousin Bolingbroke ascends my throne' Though then God knows I had no such intent But that necessity so bow'd the state That I and greatness were compell'd to kiss 'The time shall come' thus did he follow it 'The time will come that foul sin gathering head Shall break into corruption' so went on Foretelling this same time's condition And the division of our amityThere is a history in all men's lives Figuring the natures of the times deceas'd The which observ'd a man may prophesy With a near aim of the main chance of things As yet not come to life who in their seeds And weak beginning lie intreasured Such things become the hatch and brood of time And by the necessary form of this King Richard might create a perfect guess That great Northumberland then false to him Would of that seed grow to a greater falseness Which should not find a ground to root upon Unless on youAre these things then necessities Then let us meet them like necessities And that same word even now cries out on us They say the Bishop and Northumberland Are fifty thousand strongIt cannot be my lord Rumour doth double like the voice and echo The numbers of the feared Please it your Grace To go to bed Upon my soul my lord The powers that you already have sent forth Shall bring this prize in very easily To comfort you the more I have receiv'd A certain instance that Glendower is dead Your Majesty hath been this fortnight ill And these unseasoned hours perforce must ad Unto your sicknessI will

be renewed Peradventure I will with ye to the courtFore God would you wouldGo to I have spoke at a word God keep youFare you well gentle gentlemen On Bardolph lead the men away all but As I return I will fetch off these justices I do see the bottom of justice Shallow Lord Lord how subject we old men are to this vice of lying This same starv'd justice hath done nothing but prate to me of the wildness of his youth and the feats he hath done about Turnbull Street and every third word a lie duer paid to the hearer than the Turk's tribute I do remember him at Clement's Inn like a man made after supper of a cheeseparing When 'a was naked he was for all the world like a fork'd radish with a head fantastically carved upon it with a knife 'A was so forlorn that his dimensions to any thick sight were invisible 'A was the very genius of famine yet lecherous as a monkey and the whores call'd him mandrake 'A came ever in the rearward of the fashion and sung those tunes to the overscutch'd huswifes that he heard the carmen whistle and sware they were his fancies or his goodnights And now is this Vice's dagger become a squire and talks as familiarly of John a Gaunt as if he had been sworn brother to him and I'll be sworn 'a ne'er saw him but once in the Tiltyard and then he burst his head for crowding among the marshal's men I saw it and told John a Gaunt he beat his own name for you might have thrust him and all his apparel into an eelskin the case of a treble hautboy was a mansion for him a court and now has he land and beeves Well I'll be acquainted with him if I return and 't shall go hard but I'll make him a philosopher's two stones to me If the young dace be a bait for the old pike I see no reason in the law of nature but I may snap at him Let time shape and there an end
