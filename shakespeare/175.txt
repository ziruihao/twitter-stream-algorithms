befall thee good Petruchio The wager thou hast won and I will ad Unto their losses twenty thousand crowns Another dowry to another daughter For she is chang'd as she had never beenNay I will win my wager better yet And show more sign of her obedience Her newbuilt virtue and obedienceRe with andSee where she comes and brings your froward wives As prisoners to her womanly persuasion Katherine that cap of yours becomes you not Off with that bauble throw it underfoot compliesLord let me never have a cause to sigh Till I be brought to such a silly passFie what a foolish duty call you thisI would your duty were as foolish too The wisdom of your duty fair Bianca Hath cost me a hundred crowns since suppertimeThe more fool you for laying on my dutyKatherine I charge thee tell these headstrong women What duty they do owe their lords and husbandsCome come you're mocking we will have no tellingCome on I say and first begin with herShe shall notI say she shall And first begin with herFie fie unknit that threatening unkind brow And dart not scornful glances from those eyes To wound thy lord thy king thy governor It blots thy beauty as frosts do bite the meads Confounds thy fame as whirlwinds shake fair buds And in no sense is meet or amiable A woman mov'd is like a fountain troubled Muddy illseeming thick bereft of beauty And while it is so none so dry or thirsty Will deign to sip or touch one drop of it Thy husband is thy lord thy life thy keeper Thy head thy sovereign one that cares for thee And for thy maintenance commits his body To painful labour both by sea and land To watch the night in storms the day in cold Whilst thou liest warm at home secure and safe And craves no other tribute at thy hands But love fair looks and true obedience Too little payment for so great a debt Such duty as the subject owes the prince Even such a woman oweth to her husband And when she is froward peevish sullen sour And not obedient to his honest will What is she but a foul contending rebel And graceless traitor to her loving lord I am asham'd that women are so simple To offer war where they should kneel for peace Or seek for rule supremacy and sway When they are bound to serve love and obey Why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth Unapt to toll and trouble in the world But that our soft conditions and our hearts Should well agree with our external parts Come come you froward and unable worms My mind hath been as big as one of yours My heart as great my reason haply more To bandy word for word and frown for frown But now I see our lances are but straws Our strength as weak our weakness past compare That seeming to be most which we indeed least are Then vail your stomachs for it is no boot And place your hands below your husband's foot In token of which duty if he please My hand is ready may it do him easeWhy there's a wench Come on and kiss me KateWell go thy ways old lad for thou shalt ha't'Tis a good hearing when children are towardBut a harsh hearing when women are frowardCome Kate we'll to bed We three are married but you two are sped To 'Twas I won the wager though you hit the white And being a winner God give you good nightNow go thy ways thou hast tam'd a curst shrow'Tis a wonder by your leave she will be tam'd so
