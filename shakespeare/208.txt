tales of love were wont to weary you I know you joy not in a lovediscourseAy Proteus but that life is alter'd now I have done penance for contemning Love Whose high imperious thoughts have punish'd me With bitter fasts with penitential groans With nightly tears and daily heartsore sighs For in revenge of my contempt of love Love hath chas'd sleep from my enthralled eyes And made them watchers of mine own heart's sorrow O gentle Proteus Love's a mighty lord And hath so humbled me as I confess There is no woe to his correction Nor to his service no such joy on earth Now no discourse except it be of love Now can I break my fast dine sup and sleep Upon the very naked name of loveEnough I read your fortune in your eye Was this the idol that you worship soEven she and is she not a heavenly saintNo but she is an earthly paragonCall her divineI will not flatter herO flatter me for love delights in praisesWhen I was sick you gave me bitter pills And I must minister the like to youThen speak the truth by her if not divine Yet let her be a principality Sovereign to all the creatures on the earthExcept my mistressSweet except not any Except thou wilt except against my loveHave I not reason to prefer mine ownAnd I will help thee to prefer her too She shall be dignified with this high honour To bear my lady's train lest the base earth Should from her vesture chance to steal a kiss

whose worth makes other worthies nothing She is aloneThen let her aloneNot for the world Why man she is mine own And I as rich in having such a jewel As twenty seas if all their sand were pearl The water nectar and the rocks pure gold Forgive me that I do not dream on thee Because thou seest me dote upon my love My foolish rival that her father likes Only for his possessions are so huge Is gone with her along and I must after For love thou know'st is full of jealousyBut she loves youAy and we are betroth'd nay more our marriagehour With all the cunning manner of our flight Determin'd of how I must climb her window The ladder made of cords and all the means Plotted and 'greed on for my happiness Good Proteus go with me to my chamber In these affairs to aid me with thy counselGo on before I shall enquire you forth I must unto the road to disembark Some necessaries that I needs must use And then I'll presently attend youWill you make hasteI willEven as one heat another heat expels Or as one nail by strength drives out another So the remembrance of my former love Is by a newer object quite forgotten Is it my mind or Valentinus' praise Her true perfection or my false transgression That makes me reasonless to reason thus She is fair and so is Julia that I love That I did love for now my love is thaw'd Which like a waxen image 'gainst a fire Bears no impression of the thing it was Methinks my zeal to Valentine is cold And that I love him not as I was wont O but I love his lady too too much And that's the reason I love him so little How shall I dote on her with more advice That thus without advice begin to love her 'Tis but her picture I have yet beheld And that hath dazzled my reason's light But when I look on her perfections There is no reason but I shall be blind If I can

wrong my friend I shall be much forsworn And ev'n that pow'r which gave me first my oath Provokes me to this threefold perjury Love bade me swear and Love bids me forswear O sweetsuggesting Love if thou hast sinn'd Teach me thy tempted subject to excuse it At first I did adore a twinkling star But now I worship a celestial sun Unheedful vows may heedfully be broken And he wants wit that wants resolved will To learn his wit t' exchange the bad for better Fie fie unreverend tongue to call her bad Whose sovereignty so oft thou hast preferr'd With twenty thousand soulconfirming oaths I cannot leave to love and yet I do But there I leave to love where I should love Julia I lose and Valentine I lose If I keep them I needs must lose myself If I lose them thus find I by their loss For Valentine myself for Julia Silvia I to myself am dearer than a friend For love is still most precious in itself And Silvia witness heaven that made her fair Shows Julia but a swarthy Ethiope I will forget that Julia is alive Rememb'ring that my love to her is dead And Valentine I'll hold an enemy Aiming at Silvia as a sweeter friend I cannot now prove constant to myself Without some treachery us'd to Valentine This night he meaneth with a corded ladder To climb celestial Silvia's chamber window Myself in counsel his competitor Now presently I'll give her father notice Of their disguising and pretended flight Who all enrag'd will banish Valentine For Thurio he intends shall wed his daughter But Valentine being gone I'll quickly cross By some sly trick blunt Thurio's dull proceeding Love lend me wings to make my purpose swift As thou hast lent me wit to plot this driftVeronahouseand Counsel Lucetta gentle girl assist me And ev'n in kind love I do conjure thee Who art the table wherein all my thoughts Are visibly character'd and engrav'd To lesson me and tell me some good mean How with my honour I may undertake A journey to my loving ProteusAlas the way is wearisome and longA truedevoted pilgrim is not weary To measure kingdoms with his feeble steps Much less shall she that hath Love's wings to fly And when the flight is made to one so dear Of such divine perfection as Sir ProteusBetter forbear till Proteus make returnO know'st thou not his looks are my soul's food Pity the dearth that I have pined in By longing for that food so long a time Didst thou but know the inly touch of love Thou wouldst as soon go kindle fire with snow As seek to quench the fire of love with wordsI do not seek to quench your love's hot fire But qualify the fire's extreme rage Lest it should burn above the bounds of reasonThe more thou dam'st it up the more it burns The current that with gentle murmur glides Thou know'st being stopp'd impatiently doth rage But when his fair course is not hindered He makes sweet music with th' enamell'd stones Giving a gentle kiss to every sedge He overtaketh in his pilgrimage And so by many winding nooks he strays With willing sport to the wild ocean Then let me go and hinder not my course I'll be as patient as a gentle stream And make a pastime of each weary step Till the last step have brought me to my love And there I'll rest as after much turmoil A blessed soul doth in ElysiumBut in what habit will you go alongNot like a woman for I would prevent The loose encounters of lascivious men Gentle Lucetta fit me with such weeds As may beseem some wellreputed pageWhy then your ladyship must cut your hairNo girl I'll knit it up in silken strings With twenty oddconceited truelove knots To be fantastic may become a youth Of greater

then stay at home and go notNay that I will notThen never dream on infamy but go If Proteus like your journey when you come No matter who's displeas'd when you are gone I fear me he will scarce be pleas'd withalThat is the least Lucetta of my fear A thousand oaths an ocean of his tears And instances of infinite of love Warrant me welcome to my ProteusAll these are servants to deceitful menBase men that use them to so base effect But truer stars did govern Proteus' birth His words are bonds his oaths are oracles His love sincere his thoughts immaculate His tears pure messengers sent from his heart His heart as far from fraud as heaven from earthPray heav'n he prove so when you come to himNow as thou lov'st me do him not that wrong To bear a hard opinion of his truth Only deserve my love by loving him And presently go with me to my chamber To take a note of what I stand in need of To furnish me upon my longing journey All that is mine I leave at thy dispose My goods my lands my reputation Only in lieu thereof dispatch me hence Come answer not but to it presently I am impatient of my tarriance
