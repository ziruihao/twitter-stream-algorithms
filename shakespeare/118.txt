 Vienna Thepalace and EscalusMy lordOf government the properties to unfold Would seem in me t' affect speech and discourse Since I am put to know that your own science Exceeds in that the lists of all advice My strength can give you then no more remains But that to your sufficiency as your worth is able And let them work The nature of our people Our city's institutions and the terms For common justice y'are as pregnant in As art and practice hath enriched any That we remember There is our commission From which we would not have you warp Call hither I say bid come before us AngeloanWhat figure of us think you he will bear For you must know we have with special soul Elected him our absence to supply Lent him our terror dress'd him with our love And given his deputation all the organs Of our own power What think you of itIf any in Vienna be of worth To undergo such ample grace and honour It is Lord AngeloLook where he comesAlways obedient to your Grace's will I come to know your pleasureAngelo There is a kind of character in thy life That to th' observer doth thy history Fully unfold Thyself and thy belongings Are not thine own so proper as to waste Thyself upon thy virtues they on thee Heaven doth with us as we with torches do Not light them for themselves for if our virtues Did not go forth of us 'twere all alike As if we had them not Spirits are not finely touch'd But to fine issues nor Nature never lends The smallest scruple of her excellence But like a thrifty goddess she determines Herself the glory of a creditor Both thanks and use But I do bend my speech To one that can my part in him advertise Hold therefore Angelo In our remove be thou at full ourself Mortality and mercy in Vienna Live in thy tongue and heart Old Escalus Though first in question is thy secondary Take thy commissionNow good my lord Let there be some more test made of my metal Before so noble and so great a figure Be stamp'd upon itNo more evasion We have with a leaven'd and prepared choice Proceeded to you therefore take your honours Our haste from hence is of so quick condition That it prefers itself and leaves unquestion'd Matters of needful value We shall write to you As time and our concernings shall importune How it goes with us and do look to know What doth befall you here So fare you well To th' hopeful execution do I leave you Of your commissionsYet give leave my lord That we may bring you something on the wayMy haste may not admit it Nor need you on mine honour have to do With any scruple your scope is as mine own So to enforce or qualify the laws As to your soul seems good Give me your hand I'll privily away I love the people But do not like to stage me to their eyes Though it do well I do not relish well Their loud applause and Aves vehement Nor do I think the man of safe discretion That does affect it Once more fare you wellThe heavens give safety to your purposesLead forth and bring you back in happinessI thank you Fare you well I shall desire you sir to give me leave To have free speech with you and it concerns me To look into the bottom of my place A pow'r I have but of what strength and nature I am not yet instructed'Tis so with me Let us withdraw together And we may soon our satisfaction have Touching that pointI'll wait upon your honourA streetLucio and two other If the Duke with the other dukes come not to composition with the King of Hungary why then all the dukes fall upon the KingHeaven grant us its peace but not the King of Hungary'sAmenThou conclud'st like the sanctimonious pirate that went to sea with the Ten Commandments but scrap'd one out of the table'Thou shalt not steal'Ay that he raz'dWhy 'twas a commandment to command the captain and all the rest from their functions they put forth to steal There's not a soldier of us all that in the thanksgiving before meat do relish the petition well that prays for peaceI never heard any soldier dislike itI believe thee for I think thou never wast where grace was saidNo A dozen times at leastWhat in metreIn any proportion or in any languageI think or in any religionAy why not Grace is grace despite of all controversy as for example thou thyself art a wicked villain despite of all graceWell there went but a pair of shears between usI grant as there may between the lists and the velvet Thou art the listAnd thou the velvet thou art good velvet thou'rt a threepil'd piece I warrant thee I had as lief be a list of an English kersey as be pil'd as thou art pil'd for a French velvet Do I speak feelingly nowI think thou dost and indeed with most painful feeling of thy speech I will out of thine own confession learn to begin thy health but whilst I live forget to drink after theeI think I have done myself wrong have I notYes that thou hast whether thou art tainted or freeBehold behold where Madam Mitigation comes I have purchas'd as many diseases under her roof as come toTo what I prayJudgeTo three thousand dolours a yearAy and moreA French crown moreThou art always figuring diseases in me but thou art full of error I am soundNay not as one would say healthy but so sound as things that are hollow thy bones are hollow impiety has made a feast of theeHow now which of your hips has the most profound sciatica Well well there's one yonder arrested and carried to prison was worth five thousand of you allWho's that I pray thee Marry sir that's Claudio Signior ClaudioClaudio to prison 'Tis not so Nay but I know 'tis so I saw him arrested saw him carried away and which is more within these three days his head to be chopp'd offBut after all this fooling I would not have it so Art thou sure of this I am too sure of it and it is for getting Madam Julietta with childBelieve me this may be he promis'd to meet me two hours since and he was ever precise in promisekeepingBesides you know it draws something near to the speech we had to such a purposeBut most of all agreeing with the proclamationAway let's go learn the truth of itLucio andThus what with the war what with the sweat what with the gallows and what with poverty I am customshrunkHow now what's the news with youYonder man is carried to prison Well what has he doneA woman But what's his offenceGroping for trouts in a peculiar river What is there a maid with child by himNo but there's a woman with maid by him You have notheard of the proclamation have you What proclamation manAll houses in the suburbs of Vienna must be pluck'd down And what shall become of those in the cityThey shall stand for seed they had gone down too but that a wise burgher put in for them But shall all our houses of resort in the suburbs be pull'd downTo the ground mistress Why here's a change indeed in the commonwealth What shall become of meCome fear not you good counsellors lack no clients Though you change your place you need not change your trade I'll be your tapster still Courage there will be pity taken on you you that have worn your eyes almost out in the service you will be considered What's to do here Thomas Tapster Let's withdrawHere comes Signior Claudio led by the provost to prison and there's Madam JulietandfollowingFellow why dost thou show me thus to th' world Bear me to prison where I am committedI do it not in evil disposition But from Lord Angelo by special chargeThus can the demigod Authority Make us pay down for our offence by weight The words of heaven on whom it will it will On whom it will not so yet still 'tis justWhy how now Claudio whence comes this restraintFrom too much liberty my Lucio liberty As surfeit is the father of much fast So every scope by the immoderate use Turns to restraint Our natures do pursue Like rats that ravin down their proper bane A thirsty evil and when we drink we dieIf I could speak so wisely under an arrest I would send for certain of my creditors and yet to say the truth I had as lief have the foppery of freedom as the morality of imprisonment What's thy offence ClaudioWhat but to speak of would offend againWhat is't murderNoLecheryCall it soAway sir you must goOne word good friend Lucio a word with youA hundred if they'll do you any good Is lechery so look'd afterThus stands it with me upon a true contract I got possession of Julietta's bed You know the lady she is fast my wife Save that we do the denunciation lack Of outward order this we came not to Only for propagation of a dow'r Remaining in the coffer of her friends From whom we thought it meet to hide our love Till time had made them for us But it chances The stealth of our most mutual tainment With character too gross is writ on JulietWith child perhapsUnhappily even so And the new deputy now for the Duke Whether it be the fault and glimpse of newness Or whether that the body public be A horse whereon the governor doth ride Who newly in the seat that it may know He can command lets it straight feel the spur Whether the tyranny be in his place Or in his eminence that fills it up I stagger in But this new governor Awakes me all the enrolled penalties Which have like unscour'd armour hung by th' wall So long that nineteen zodiacs have gone round And none of them been worn and for a name Now puts the drowsy and neglected act Freshly on me 'Tis surely for a nameI warrant it is and thy head stands so tickle on thy shoulders that a milkmaid if she be in love may sigh it off Send after the Duke and appeal to himI have done so but he's not to be found I prithee Lucio do me this kind service This day my sister should the cloisterAnd there receive her approbation Acquaint her with the danger of my state Implore her in my voice that she make friends To the strict deputy bid herself assay him I have great hope in that for in her youth There is a prone and speechless dialect Such as move men beside she hath prosperous art When she will play with reason and discourse And well she can persuadeI pray she may as well for the encouragement of the like which else would stand under grievous imposition as for the enjoying of thy life who I would be sorry should be thus foolishly lost at a game of ticktack I'll to herI thank you good friend LucioWithin two hoursCome officer away A monasteryand No holy father throw away that thought Believe not that the dribbling dart of love Can pierce a complete bosom Why I desire thee To give me secret harbour hath a purpose More grave and wrinkled than the aims and ends Of burning youthMay your Grace speak of itMy holy sir none better knows than you How I have ever lov'd the life removed And held in idle price to haunt assemblies Where youth and cost a witless bravery keeps I have deliver'd to Lord Angelo A man of stricture and firm abstinence My absolute power and place here in Vienna And he supposes me travell'd to Poland For so I have strew'd it in the common ear And so it is received Now pious sir You will demand of me why I do thisGladly my lordWe have strict statutes and most biting laws The needful bits and curbs to headstrong steeds Which for this fourteen years we have let slip Even like an o'ergrown lion in a cave That goes not out to prey Now as fond fathers Having bound up the threat'ning twigs of birch Only to stick it in their children's sight For terror not to use in time the rod Becomes more mock'd than fear'd so our decrees Dead to infliction to themselves are dead And liberty plucks justice by the nose The baby beats the nurse and quite athwart Goes all decorumIt rested in your Grace To unloose this tiedup justice when you pleas'd And it in you more dreadful would have seem'd Than in Lord AngeloI do fear too dreadful Sith 'twas my fault to give the people scope 'Twould be my tyranny to strike and gall them For what I bid them do for we bid this be done When evil deeds have their permissive pass And not the punishment Therefore indeed my father I have on Angelo impos'd the office Who may in th' ambush of my name strike home And yet my nature never in the fight To do in slander And to behold his sway I will as 'twere a brother of your order Visit both prince and people Therefore I prithee Supply me with the habit and instruct me How I may formally in person bear me Like a true friar Moe reasons for this action At our more leisure shall I render you Only this one Lord Angelo is precise Stands at a guard with envy scarce confesses That his blood flows or that his appetite Is more to bread than stone Hence shall we see If power change purpose what our seemers be A nunneryand And have you nuns no farther privilegesAre not these large enoughYes truly I speak not as desiring more But rather wishing a more strict restraint Upon the sisterhood the votarists of Saint Clare Within Ho Peace be in this placeWho's that which callsIt is a man's voice Gentle Isabella Turn you the key and know his business of him You may I may not you are yet unsworn When you have vow'd you must not speak with men But in the presence of the prioress Then if you speak you must not show your face Or if you show your face you must not speak He calls again I pray you answer him Peace and prosperity Who is't that calls Hail virgin if you be as those cheekroses Proclaim you are no less Can you so stead me As bring me to the sight of Isabella A novice of this place and the fair sister To her unhappy brother ClaudioWhy her 'unhappy brother' Let me ask The rather for I now must make you know I am that Isabella and his sisterGentle and fair your brother kindly greets you Not to be weary with you he's in prisonWoe me For whatFor that which if myself might be his judge He should receive his punishment in thanks He hath got his friend with childSir make me not your storyIt is true I would not though 'tis my familiar sin With maids to seem the lapwing and to jest Tongue far from heart play with all virgins so I hold you as a thing enskied and sainted By your renouncement an immortal spirit And to be talk'd with in sincerity As with a saintYou do blaspheme the good in mocking meDo not believe it Fewness and truth 'tis thus Your brother and his lover have embrac'd As those that feed grow full as blossoming time That from the seedness the bare fallow brings To teeming foison even so her plenteous womb Expresseth his full tilth and husbandrySome one with child by him My cousin JulietIs she your cousinAdoptedly as schoolmaids change their names By vain though apt affectionShe it isO let him marry herThis is the point The Duke is very strangely gone from hence Bore many gentlemen myself being one In hand and hope of action but we do learn By those that know the very nerves of state His givingsout were of an infinite distance From his truemeant design Upon his place And with full line of his authority Governs Lord Angelo a man whose blood Is very snowbroth one who never feels The wanton stings and motions of the sense But doth rebate and blunt his natural edge With profits of the mind study and fast He to give fear to use and liberty Which have for long run by the hideous law As mice by lions hath pick'd out an act Under whose heavy sense your brother's life Falls into forfeit he arrests him on it And follows close the rigour of the statute To make him an example All hope is gone Unless you have the grace by your fair prayer To soften Angelo And that's my pith of business 'Twixt you and your poor brotherDoth he so seek his lifeHas censur'd him Already and as I hear the Provost hath A warrant for his executionAlas what poor ability's in me To do him goodAssay the pow'r you haveMy power alas I doubtOur doubts are traitors And make us lose the good we oft might win By fearing to attempt Go to Lord Angelo And let him learn to know when maidens sue Men give like gods but when they weep and kneel All their petitions are as freely theirs As they themselves would owe themI'll see what I can doBut speedilyI will about it straight No longer staying but to give the Mother Notice of my affair I humbly thank you Commend me to my brother soon at night I'll send him certain word of my successI take my leave of youGood sir adieu
