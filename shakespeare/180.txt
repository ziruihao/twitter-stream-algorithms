'Ceres' I thought to have told thee of it but I fear'd Lest I might anger theeSay again where didst thou leave these varletsI told you sir they were redhot with drinking So full of valour that they smote the air For breathing in their faces beat the ground For kissing of their feet yet always bending Towards their project Then I beat my tabor At which like unback'd colts they prick'd their ears Advanc'd their eyelids lifted up their noses As they smelt music so I charm'd their cars That calflike they my lowing follow'd through Tooth'd briers sharp furzes pricking goss and thorns Which ent'red their frail shins At last I left them I' th' filthy mantled pool beyond your cell There dancing up to th' chins that the foul lake O'erstunk their feetThis was well done my bird Thy shape invisible retain thou still The trumpery in my house go bring it hither For stale to catch these thievesI go I goA devil a born devil on whose nature Nurture can never stick on whom my pains Humanely
