Thou hast no more brain than I have in mine elbows an assinico may tutor thee You scurvy valiant ass Thou art here but to thrash Troyans and thou art bought and sold among those of any wit like a

of wit he utters His evasions have ears thus long I have bobb'd his brain more than he has beat my bones I will buy nine sparrows for a penny and his pia mater is not worth the ninth part of a sparrow This lord Achilles Ajaxwho wears his wit in his belly and his guts in his headI'll tell you what I say of himWhatI say this Ajax offers to strike himNay good AjaxHas not so much witNay I must hold youAs will stop the eye of Helen's needle for whom he comes to fightPeace foolI would have peace and quietness but the fool will not he there that he look you thereO thou damned cur I shallWill you set your wit to a fool'sNo I warrant you the fool's will shame itGood words ThersitesWhat's the quarrelI bade the vile owl go learn me the tenour of the proclamation and he rails upon meI serve thee notWell go to go toI serve here voluntaryYour last service was suff'rance 'twas not voluntary No man is beaten voluntary Ajax was here the voluntary and you as under an impressE'en so a great deal of your wit too lies in your sinews or else there be liars Hector shall have a great catch an he knock out either of your brains 'a were as good crack a fusty nut with no kernelWhat with me too ThersitesThere's Ulysses and old Nestorwhose wit was mouldy ere your grandsires had nails on their toesyoke you like draught oxen and make you plough up the warsWhat whatYes good sooth To Achilles to Ajax toI shall cut out your tongue'Tis no matter I shall speak as much as thou afterwardsNo more words Thersites peaceI will hold my peace when Achilles' brach bids me shall IThere's for you PatroclusI will see you hang'd like clotpoles ere I come any more to your tents I will keep where there is wit stirring and leave the faction of foolsA good riddanceMarry this sir is proclaim'd through all our host That Hector by the fifth hour of the sun Will with a trumpet 'twixt our tents and Troy Tomorrow morning call some knight to arms That hath a stomach and such a one that dare Maintain I know not what 'tis trash FarewellFarewell Who shall answer himI know not 'tis put to lott'ry Otherwise He knew his manO meaning you I will go learn more of itTroypalaceand After so many hours lives speeches spent Thus once again says Nestor from the Greeks 'Deliver Helen and all damage else As honour loss of time travail expense Wounds friends and what else dear that is consum'd In hot digestion of this cormorant war Shall be struck off' Hector what say you to'tThough no man lesser fears the Greeks than I As far as toucheth my particular Yet dread Priam There is no lady of more softer bowels More spongy to suck in the sense of fear More ready to cry out 'Who knows what follows' Than Hector is The wound of peace is surety Surety secure but modest doubt is call'd The beacon of the wise the tent that searches To th' bottom of the worst Let Helen go Since the first sword was drawn about this question Every tithe soul 'mongst many thousand dismes Hath been as dear as HelenI mean of ours If we have lost so many tenths of ours To guard a thing not ours nor worth to us Had it our name the value of one ten What merit's in that reason which denies The yielding of her upFie fie my brother Weigh you the worth and honour of a king So great as our dread father's in a scale Of common ounces Will you with counters sum The pastproportion of his infinite And buckle in a waist most fathomless With spans and inches so diminutive As fears and reasons Fie for godly shameNo marvel though you bite so sharp at reasons You are so empty of them Should not our father Bear the great sway of his affairs with reasons Because your speech hath none that tells him soYou are for dreams and slumbers brother priest You fur your gloves with reason Here are your reasons You know an enemy intends you harm You know a sword employ'd is perilous And reason flies the object of all harm Who marvels then when Helenus beholds A Grecian and his sword if he do set The very wings of reason to his heels And fly like chidden Mercury from Jove Or like a star disorb'd Nay if we talk of reason Let's shut our gates and sleep Manhood and honour Should have hare hearts would they but fat their thoughts With this cramm'd reason Reason and respect Make livers pale and lustihood dejectBrother she is not worth what she doth cost The keepingWhat's aught but as 'tis valuedBut value dwells not in particular will It holds his estimate and dignity As well wherein 'tis precious of itself As in the prizer 'Tis mad idolatry To make the service greater than the godI And the will dotes that is attributive To what infectiously itself affects Without some image of th' affected meritI take today a wife and my election Is led on in the conduct of my will My will enkindled by mine eyes and ears Two traded pilots 'twixt the dangerous shores Of will and judgment how may I avoid Although my will distaste what it elected The wife I chose There can be no evasion To blench from this and to stand firm by honour We turn not back the silks upon the merchant When we have soil'd them nor the remainder viands We do not throw in unrespective sieve Because we now are full It was thought meet Paris should do some vengeance on the Greeks Your breath with full consent benied his sails The seas and winds old wranglers took a truce And did him service He touch'd the ports desir'd And for an old aunt whom the Greeks held captive He brought a Grecian queen whose youth and freshness Wrinkles Apollo's and makes stale the morning Why keep we her The Grecians keep our aunt Is she worth keeping Why she is a pearl Whose price hath launch'd above a thousand ships And turn'd crown'd kings to merchants If you'll avouch 'twas wisdom Paris went As you must needs for you all cried 'Go go' If you'll confess he brought home worthy prize As you must needs for you all clapp'd your hands And cried 'Inestimable' why do you now The issue of your proper wisdoms rate And do a deed that never fortune did Beggar the estimation which you priz'd Richer than sea and land O theft most base That we have stol'n what we do fear to keep But thieves unworthy of a thing so stol'n That in their country did them that disgrace We fear to warrant in our native placeWithin Cry Troyans cryWhat noise what shriek is this'Tis our mad sister I do know her voiceWithin Cry TroyansIt is Cassandra ravingCry Troyans cry Lend me ten thousand eyes And I will fill them with prophetic tearsPeace sister peaceVirgins and boys midage and wrinkled eld Soft infancy that nothing canst but cry Add to my clamours Let us pay betimes A moiety of that mass of moan to come Cry Troyans cry Practise your eyes with tears Troy must not be nor goodly Ilion stand Our firebrand brother Paris burns us all Cry Troyans cry A Helen and a woe Cry cry Troy burns or else let Helen goNow youthful Troilus do not these high strains Of divination in our sister work Some touches of remorse or is your blood So madly hot that no discourse of reason Nor fear of bad success in a bad cause Can qualify the sameWhy brother Hector We may not think the justness of each act Such and no other than event doth form it Nor once deject the courage of our minds Because Cassandra's mad Her brainsick raptures Cannot distaste the goodness of a quarrel Which hath our several honours all engag'd To make it gracious For my private part I am no more touch'd than all Priam's sons And Jove forbid there should be done amongst us Such things as might offend the weakest spleen To fight for and maintainElse might the world convince of levity As well my undertakings as your counsels But I attest the gods your full consent Gave wings to my propension and cut of All fears attending on so dire a project For what alas can these my single arms What propugnation is in one man's valour To stand the push and enmity of those This quarrel would excite Yet I protest Were I alone to pass the difficulties And had as ample power as I have will Paris should ne'er retract what he hath done Nor faint in the pursuitParis you speak Like one besotted on your sweet delights You have the honey still but these the gall So to be valiant is no praise at allSir I propose not merely to myself The pleasures such a beauty brings with it But I would have the soil of her fair rape Wip'd off in honourable keeping her What treason were it to the ransack'd queen Disgrace to your great worths and shame to me Now to deliver her possession up On terms of base compulsion Can it be That so degenerate a strain as this Should once set footing in your generous bosoms There's not the meanest spirit on our party Without a heart to dare or sword to draw When Helen is defended nor none so noble Whose life were ill bestow'd or death unfam'd Where Helen is the subject Then I say Well may we fight for her whom we know well The world's large spaces cannot parallelParis and Troilus you have both said well And on the cause and question now in hand Have gloz'd but superficially not much Unlike young men whom Aristode thought Unfit to hear moral philosophy The reasons you allege do more conduce To the hot passion of distemp'red blood Than to make up a free determination 'Twixt right and wrong for pleasure and revenge Have ears more deaf than adders to the voice Of any true decision Nature craves All dues be rend'red to their owners Now What nearer debt in all humanity Than wife is to the husband If this law Of nature be corrupted through affection And that great minds of partial indulgence To their benumbed wills resist the same There is a law in each wellorder'd nation To curb those raging appetites that are Most disobedient and refractory If Helen then be wife to Sparta's king As it is known she isthese moral laws Of nature and of nations speak aloud To have her back return'd Thus to persist In doing wrong extenuates not wrong But makes it much more heavy Hector's opinion Is this in way of truth Yet ne'er the less My spritely brethren I propend to you In resolution to keep Helen still For 'tis a cause that hath no mean dependence Upon our joint and several dignitiesWhy there you touch'd the life of our design Were it not glory that we more affected Than the performance of our heaving spleens I would not wish a drop of Troyan blood Spent more in her defence But worthy Hector She is a theme of honour and renown A spur to valiant and magnanimous deeds Whose present courage may beat down our foes And fame in time to come canonize us For I presume brave Hector would not lose So rich advantage of a promis'd glory As smiles upon the forehead of this action For the wide world's revenueI am yours You valiant offspring of great Priamus I have a roisting challenge sent amongst The dull and factious nobles of the Greeks Will strike amazement to their drowsy spirits I was advertis'd their great general slept Whilst emulation in the army crept This I presume will wake himThe Grecian camp Before the tent ofsolusHow now Thersites What lost in the labyrinth of thy fury Shall the elephant Ajax carry it thus He beats me and I rail at him O worthy satisfaction Would it were otherwise that I could beat him whilst he rail'd at me foot I'll learn to conjure and raise devils but I'll see some issue of my spiteful execrations Then there's Achilles a rare engineer If Troy be not taken till these two undermine it the walls will stand till they fall of themselves O thou great thunderdarter of Olympus forget that thou art Jove the king of gods and Mercury lose all the serpentine craft of thy caduceus if ye take not that little little lessthanlittle wit from them that they have which shortarm'd ignorance itself knows is so abundant scarce it will not in circumvention deliver a fly from a spider without drawing their massy irons and cutting the web After this the vengeance on the whole camp or rather the Neapolitan boneache for that methinks is the curse depending on those that war for a placket I have said my prayers and devil Envy say 'Amen' What ho my Lord AchillesWho's there Thersites Good Thersites come in and railIf I could 'a rememb'red a gilt counterfeit thou wouldst not have slipp'd out of my contemplation but it is no matter thyself upon thyself The common curse of mankind folly and ignorance be thine in great revenue Heaven bless thee from a tutor and discipline come not near thee Let thy blood be thy direction till thy death Then if she that lays thee out says thou art a fair corse I'll be sworn and sworn upon't she never shrouded any but lazars Amen Where's AchillesWhat art thou devout Wast thou in prayerAy the heavens hear meAmenWho's thereThersites my lordWhere where O where Art thou come Why my cheese my digestion why hast thou not served thyself in to my table so many meals Come what's AgamemnonThy commander Achilles Then tell me Patroclus what's AchillesThy lord Thersites Then tell me I pray thee what's ThersitesThy knower Patroclus Then tell me Patroclus what art thouThou must tell that knowestO tell tellI'll decline the whole question Agamemnon commands Achilles Achilles is my lord I am Patroclus' knower and Patroclus is a foolYou rascalPeace fool I have not doneHe is a privileg'd man Proceed ThersitesAgamemnon is a fool Achilles is a fool Thersites is a fool and as aforesaid Patroclus is a foolDerive this comeAgamemnon is a fool to offer to command Achilles Achilles is a fool to be commanded of Agamemnon Thersites is a fool to serve such a fool and this Patroclus is a fool positiveWhy am I a foolMake that demand of the Creator It suffices me thou art Look you who comes hereCome Patroclus I'll speak with nobody Come in with me Thersites Here is such patchery such juggling and such knavery All the argument is a whore and a cuckolda good quarrel to draw emulous factions and bleed to death upon Now the dry serpigo on the subject and war and lechery confound alland Where is AchillesWithin his tent but illdispos'd my lordLet it be known to him that we are here He shent our messengers and we lay by Our appertainings visiting of him Let him be told so lest perchance he think We dare not move the question of our place Or know not what we areI shall say so to himWe saw him at the opening of his tent He is not sickYes lionsick sick of proud heart You may call it melancholy if you will favour the man but by my head 'tis pride But why why Let him show us a cause A word my lord Takes asideWhat moves Ajax thus to bay at himAchilles hath inveigled his fool from him Who ThersitesHeThen will Ajax lack matter if he have lost his argumentNo you see he is his argument that has his argument AchillesAll the better their fraction is more our wish than their faction But it was a strong composure a fool could disuniteThe amity that wisdom knits not folly may easily untie ReHere comes PatroclusNo Achilles with himThe elephant hath joints but none for courtesy his legs are legs for necessity not for flexureAchilles bids me say he is much sorry If any thing more than your sport and pleasure Did move your greatness and this noble state To call upon him he hopes it is no other But for your health and your digestion sake An afterdinner's breathHear you Patroclus We are too well acquainted with these answers But his evasion wing'd thus swift with scorn Cannot outfly our apprehensions Much attribute he hath and much the reason Why we ascribe it to him Yet all his virtues Not virtuously on his own part beheld Do in our eyes begin to lose their gloss Yea like fair fruit in an unwholesome dish Are like to rot untasted Go and tell him We come to speak with him and you shall not sin If you do say we think him overproud And underhonest in selfassumption greater Than in the note of judgment and worthier than himself Here tend the savage strangeness he puts on Disguise the holy strength of their command And underwrite in an observing kind His humorous predominance yea watch His pettish lunes his ebbs his flows as if The passage and whole carriage of this action Rode on his tide Go tell him this and ad That if he overhold his price so much We'll none of him but let him like an engine Not portable lie under this report Bring action hither this cannot go to war A stirring dwarf we do allowance give Before a sleeping giant Tell him soI shall and bring his answer presentlyIn second voice we'll not be satisfied We come to speak with him Ulyssesyou What is he more than anotherNo more than what he thinks he isIs he so much Do you not think he thinks himself a better man than I amNo questionWill you subscribe his thought and say he isNo noble Ajax you are as strong as valiant as wise no less noble much more gentle and altogether more tractableWhy should a man be proud How doth pride grow I know not what pride isYour mind is the clearer Ajax and your virtues the fairer He that is proud eats up himself Pride is his own glass his own trumpet his own chronicle and whatever praises itself but in the deed devours the deed in the praise Re I do hate a proud man as I do hate the engend'ring of toadsAside And yet he loves himself is't not strangeAchilles will not to the field tomorrowWhat's his excuseHe doth rely on none But carries on the stream of his dispose Without observance or respect of any In will peculiar and in selfadmissionWhy will he not upon our fair request Untent his person and share the air with usThings small as nothing for request's sake only He makes important possess'd he is with greatness And speaks not to himself but with a pride That quarrels at selfbreath Imagin'd worth Holds in his blood such swol'n and hot discourse That 'twixt his mental and his active parts Kingdom'd Achilles in commotion rages And batters down himself What should I say He is so plaguy proud that the death tokens of it Cry 'No recovery'Let Ajax go to him Dear lord go you and greet him in his tent 'Tis said he holds you well and will be led At your request a little from himselfO Agamemnon let it not be so We'll consecrate the steps that Ajax makes When they go from Achilles Shall the proud lord That bastes his arrogance with his own seam And never suffers matter of the worldhis thoughts save such as doth revolve And ruminate himselfshall he be worshipp'd Of that we hold an idol more than he No this thriceworthy and right valiant lord Shall not so stale his palm nobly acquir'd Nor by my will assubjugate his merit As amply titled as Achilles is By going to Achilles That were to enlard his fatalready pride And add more coals to Cancer when he burns With taining great Hyperion This lord go to him Jupiter forbid And say in thunder 'Achilles go to him'Aside O this is well He rubs the vein of himAside And how his silence drinks up this applauseIf I go to him with my armed fist I'll pash him o'er the faceO no you shall not goAn 'a be proud with me I'll pheeze his pride Let me go to himNot for the worth that hangs upon our quarrelA paltry insolent fellowAside How he describes himselfCan he not be sociableAside The raven chides blacknessI'll let his humours bloodAside He will be the physician that should be the patientAn all men were a my mindAside Wit would be out of fashion'A should not bear it so 'a should eat's words first Shall pride carry itAside An 'twould you'd carry halfAside 'A would have ten sharesI will knead him I'll make him suppleAside He's not yet through warm Force him with praises pour in pour in his ambition is dryToMy lord you feed too much on this dislikeOur noble general do not do soYou must prepare to fight without AchillesWhy 'tis this naming of him does him harm Here is a manbut 'tis before his face I will be silentWherefore should you so He is not emulous as Achilles isKnow the whole world he is as valiantA whoreson dog that shall palter with us thus Would he were a TroyanWhat a vice were it in Ajax nowIf he were proudOr covetous of praiseAy or surly borneOr strange or selfaffectedThank the heavens lord thou art of sweet composure Praise him that gat thee she that gave thee suck Fam'd be thy tutor and thy parts of nature Thricefam'd beyond beyond all erudition But he that disciplin'd thine arms to fight Let Mars divide eternity in twain And give him half and for thy vigour Bullbearing Milo his addition yield To sinewy Ajax I will not praise thy wisdom Which like a bourn a pale a shore confines Thy spacious and dilated parts Here's Nestor Instructed by the antiquary times He must he is he cannot but be wise But pardon father Nestor were your days As green as Ajax' and your brain so temper'd You should not have the eminence of him But be as AjaxShall I call you fatherAy my good sonBe rul'd by him Lord AjaxThere is no tarrying here the hart Achilles Keeps thicket Please it our great general To call together all his state of war Fresh kings are come to Troy Tomorrow We must with all our main of power stand fast And here's a lordcome knights from east to west And cull their flower Ajax shall cope the bestGo we to council Let Achilles sleep Light boats sail swift though greater hulks draw deep
