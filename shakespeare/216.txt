the I that please some try all both joy and terror Of good and bad that makes and unfolds error Now take upon me in the name of Time To use my wings Impute it not a crime To me or my swift passage that I slide O'er sixteen years and leave the growth untried Of that wide gap since it is in my pow'r To o'erthrow law and in one selfborn hour To plant and o'erwhelm custom Let me pass The same I am ere ancient'st order was Or what is now receiv'd I witness to The times that brought them in so shall I do To th' freshest things now reigning and make stale The glistering of this present as my tale Now seems to it Your patience this allowing I turn my glass and give my scene such growing As you had slept between Leontes leaving Th' effects of his fond jealousies so grieving That he shuts up himself imagine me Gentle spectators that I now may be In fair Bohemia and remember well I mention'd a son o' th' King's which Florizel I now name to you and with speed so pace To speak of Perdita now grown in grace Equal with wond'ring What of her ensues I list not prophesy but let Time's news Be known when 'tis brought forth A shepherd's daughter And what to her adheres which follows after Is th' argument of Time Of this allow If ever you have spent time worse ere now If never yet that Time himself doth say He wishes earnestly you never mayBohemia The palace of and I pray thee good Camillo be no more importunate 'tis a sickness denying thee anything a death to grant thisIt is fifteen years since I saw my country though I have for the most part been aired abroad I desire to lay my bones there Besides the penitent King my master hath sent for me to whose feeling sorrows I might be some allay or I o'erween to think so which is another spur to my departureAs thou lov'st me Camillo wipe not out the rest of thy services by leaving me now The need I have of thee thine own goodness hath made Better not to have had thee than thus to want thee thou having made me businesses which none without thee can sufficiently manage must either stay to execute them thyself or take away with thee the very services thou hast done which if I have not enough considered as too much I cannot to be more thankful to thee shall be my study and my profit therein the heaping friendships Of that fatal country Sicilia prithee speak no more whose very naming punishes me with the remembrance of that penitent as thou call'st him and reconciled king my brother whose loss of his most precious queen and children are even now to be afresh lamented Say to me when saw'st thou the Prince Florizel my son Kings are no less unhappy their issue not being gracious than they are in losing them when they have approved their virtuesSir it is three days since I saw the Prince What his happier affairs may be are to me unknown but I have missingly noted he is of late much retired from court and is less frequent to his princely exercises than formerly he hath appearedI have considered so much Camillo and with some care so far that I have eyes under my service which look upon his removedness from whom I have this intelligence that he is seldom from the house of a most homely shepherd a man they say that from very nothing and beyond the imagination of his neighbours is grown into an unspeakable estateI have heard sir of such a man who hath a daughter of most rare note The report of her is extended more than can be thought to begin from such a cottageThat's likewise part of my intelligence but I fear the angle that plucks our son thither Thou shalt accompany us to the place where we will not appearing what we are have some question with the shepherd from whose simplicity I think it not uneasy to get the cause of my son's resort thither Prithee be my present partner in this business and lay aside the thoughts of SiciliaI willingly obey your commandMy best Camillo We must disguise ourselves Bohemia A road near thecottage singing When daffodils begin to peer With heigh the doxy over the dale Why then comes in the sweet o' the year For the red blood reigns in the winter's pale The white sheet bleaching on the hedge With heigh the sweet birds O how they sing Doth set my pugging tooth on edge For a quart of ale is a dish for a king The lark that tirralirra chants With heigh with heigh the thrush and the jay Are summer songs for me and my aunts While we lie tumbling in the hay I have serv'd Prince Florizel and in my time wore threepile but now I am out of service But shall I go mourn for that my dear The pale moon shines by night And when I wander here and there I then do most go right If tinkers may have leave to live And bear the sowskin budget Then my account I well may give And in the stocks avouch it My traffic is sheets when the kite builds look to lesser linen My father nam'd me Autolycus who being I as am litter'd under Mercury was likewise a snapperup of unconsidered trifles With die and drab I purchas'd this caparison and my revenue is the

forges dread your greatness Hath not been us'd to fear Even now I tremble To think your father by some accident Should pass this way as you did O the Fates How would he look to see his work so noble Vilely bound up What would he say Or how Should I in these my borrowed flaunts behold The sternness of his presenceApprehend Nothing but jollity The gods themselves Humbling their deities to love have

any thing though I report it That should be silent If young Doricles Do light upon her she shall bring him that Which he not dreams ofa O master if you did but hear the pedlar at the door you would

tunesHe could never come better he shall come in I love a ballad but even too well if it be doleful matter merrily set down or a very pleasant thing indeed and sung lamentablyHe hath songs for man or woman of all sizes no milliner can so fit his customers with gloves He has the prettiest lovesongs for maids so without bawdry which is strange with such delicate burdens of dildos and fadings 'jump her and thump her' and where some stretchmouth'd rascal would as it were mean mischief and break a foul gap into the matter he makes the maid to answer 'Whoop do me no harm good man' puts him off slights him with 'Whoop do me no harm good man'This is a brave fellowBelieve me thou talkest of an admirable conceited fellow Has he any unbraided waresHe hath ribbons of all the colours i' th'

shalt we'll bar thee from succession Not hold thee of our blood no not our kin Farre than Deucalion off Mark thou my words Follow us to the court Thou churl for this time Though full of our displeasure yet we free thee From the dead blow of it And you enchantment Worthy enough a herdsman yea him too That makes himself but for our honour therein Unworthy thee if ever henceforth thou These rural latches to his entrance open Or hoop his body more with thy embraces I will devise a death as cruel for thee As thou art tender to'tEven here undone I was not much afeard for once or twice I was about to speak and tell him plainly The selfsame sun that shines upon his court Hides not his visage from our cottage but Looks on alikeTo Will't please you sir be gone I told you what would come of this Beseech you Of your own state take care This dream of mine Being now awake I'll queen it no inch farther But milk my ewes and weepWhy how now father Speak ere thou diestI cannot speak nor think Nor dare to know that which I knowTo O sir You have undone a man of fourscorethree That thought to fill his grave in quiet yea To die upon the bed my father died To lie close by his honest bones but now Some hangman must put on my shroud and lay me Where no priest shovels in dust ToO cursed wretch That knew'st this was the Prince and wouldst adventure To mingle faith with him Undone undone If I might die within this hour I have liv'd To die when I desire Why look you so upon me I am but sorry not afeard delay'd But nothing alt'red What I was I am More straining on for plucking back not following My leash unwillinglyGracious my lord You know your father's temper At this time He will allow no speech which I do guess You do not purpose to him and as hardly Will he endure your sight as yet I fear Then till the fury of his Highness settle Come not before himI not purpose it I think CamilloEven he my lordHow often have I told you 'twould be thus How often said my dignity would last But till 'twere knownIt cannot fail but by The violation of my faith and then Let nature crush the sides o' th' earth together And mar the seeds within Lift up thy looks From my succession wipe me father I Am heir to my affectionBe advis'dI am and by my fancy if my reason Will thereto be obedient I have reason If not my senses better pleas'd with madness Do bid it welcomeThis is desperate sirSo call it but it does fulfil my vow I needs must think it honesty Camillo Not for Bohemia nor the pomp that may Be thereat glean'd for all the sun sees or The close earth wombs or the profound seas hides In unknown fathoms will I break my oath To this my fair belov'd Therefore I pray you As you have ever been my father's honour'd friend When he shall miss me as in faith I mean not To see him any more cast your good counsels Upon his passion Let myself and Fortune Tug for the time to come This you may know And so deliver I am put to sea With her who here I cannot hold on shore And most opportune to her need I have A vessel rides fast by but not prepar'd For this design What course I mean to hold Shall nothing benefit your knowledge nor Concern me the reportingO my lord I would your spirit were easier for advice Or stronger for your needHark Perdita Takes her aside To I'll hear you by and byHe's irremovable Resolv'd for flight Now were I happy if His going I could frame to serve my turn Save him from danger do him love and honour Purchase the sight again of dear Sicilia And that unhappy king my master whom I so much thirst to seeNow good Camillo I am so fraught with curious business that I leave out ceremonySir I think You have heard of my poor services i' th' love That I have borne your fatherVery nobly Have you deserv'd It is my father's music To speak your deeds not little of his care To have them recompens'd as thought onWell my lord If you may please to think I love the King And through him what's nearest to him which is Your gracious self embrace but my direction If your more ponderous and settled project May suffer alteration on mine honour I'll point you where you shall have such receiving As shall become your Highness where you may Enjoy your mistress from the whom I see There's no disjunction to be made but by As heavens forfend your ruin marry her And with my best endeavours in your absence Your discontenting father strive to qualify And bring him up to likingHow Camillo May this almost a miracle be done That I may call thee something more than man And after that trust to theeHave you thought on A place whereto you'll goNot any yet But as th' unthoughton accident is guilty To what we wildly do so we profess Ourselves to be the slaves of chance and flies Of every wind that blowsThen list to me This follows if you will not change your purpose But undergo this flight make for Sicilia And there present yourself and your fair princess For so I see she must be fore Leontes She shall be habited as it becomes The partner of your bed Methinks I see Leontes opening his free arms and weeping His welcomes forth asks thee there on forgiveness' As 'twere i' th' father's person kisses the hands Of your fresh princess o'er and o'er divides him 'Twixt his unkindness and his kindness th' one He chides to hell and bids the other grow Faster than thought or timeWorthy Camillo What colour for my visitation shall I Hold up before himSent by the King your father To greet him and to give him comforts Sir The manner of your bearing towards him with What you as from your father shall deliver Things known betwixt us three I'll write you down The which shall point you forth at every sitting What you must say that he shall not perceive But that you have your father's bosom there And speak his very heartI am bound to you There is some sap in thisA course more promising Than a wild dedication of yourselves To unpath'd waters undream'd shores most certain To miseries enough no hope to help you But as you shake off one to take another Nothing so certain as your anchors who Do their best office if they can but stay you Where you'll be loath to be Besides you know Prosperity's the very bond of love Whose fresh complexion and whose heart together Affliction altersOne of these is true I think affliction may subdue the cheek But not take in the mindYea say you so There shall not at your father's house these seven years Be born another suchMy good Camillo She is as forward of her breeding as She is i' th' rear o' our birthI cannot say 'tis pity She lacks instructions for she seems a mistress To most that teachYour pardon sir for this I'll blush you thanksMy prettiest Perdita But O the thorns we stand upon Camillo Preserver of my father now of me The medicine of our house how shall we do We are not furnish'd like Bohemia's son Nor shall appear in SiciliaMy lord Fear none of this I think you know my fortunes Do all lie there It shall be so my care To have you royally appointed as if The scene you play were mine For instance sir That you may know you shall not want one wordThey talk asideRe Ha ha what a fool Honesty is and Trust his sworn brother a very simple gentleman I have sold all my trumpery not a counterfeit stone not a ribbon glass pomander brooch tablebook ballad knife tape glove shoetie bracelet hornring to keep my pack from fasting They throng who should buy first as if my trinkets had been hallowed and brought a benediction to the buyer by which means I saw whose purse was best in picture and what I saw to my good use I rememb'red My clown who wants but something to be a reasonable man grew so in love with the wenches' song that he would not stir his pettitoes till he had both tune and words which so drew the rest of the herd to me that all their other senses stuck in ears You might have pinch'd a placket it was senseless 'twas nothing to geld a codpiece of a purse I would have fil'd keys off that hung in chains No hearing no feeling but my sir's song and admiring the
