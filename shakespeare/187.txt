The woods Before 's caveand As I took note of the place it cannot be far where he abidesto be thought of him Does the rumour hold for true that he's so full of goldCertain Alcibiades reports it Phrynia and Timandra had gold of him He likewise enrich'd poor straggling soldiers with great quantity 'Tis said he gave unto his steward a mighty sumThen this breaking of his has been but a try for his friendsNothing else You shall see him a palm in Athens again and flourish with the highest Therefore 'tis not amiss we tender our loves to him in this suppos'd distress of his it will show honestly in us and is very likely to load our purposes with what they travail for if it be just and true report that goes of his havingWhat have you now to present unto himNothing at this time but my visitation only I will promise him an excellent pieceI must serve him so too tell him of an intent that's coming toward himGood as the best Promising is the very air o' th' time it opens the eyes of expectation Performance is ever the duller for his act and but in the plainer and simpler kind of people the deed of saying is quite out of use To promise is most courtly and fashionable performance is a kind of will or testament which argues a great sickness in his judgment that makes itfrom his caveAside Excellent workman Thou canst not paint a man so bad as is thyselfI am thinking what I shall say I have provided for him It must be a personating of himself a satire against the softness of prosperity with a discovery of the infinite flatteries that follow youth and opulencyAside Must thou needs stand for a villain in thine own work Wilt thou whip thine own faults in other men Do so I have gold for theeNay let's seek him Then do we sin against our own estate When we may profit meet and come too lateTrue When the day serves before blackcorner'd night Find what thou want'st by free and offer'd light ComeAside I'll meet you at the turn What a god's gold That he is worshipp'd in a baser temple Than where swine feed 'Tis thou that rig'st the bark and plough'st the foam Settlest admired reverence in a slave To thee be worship and thy saints for aye Be crown'd with plagues that thee alone obey Fit I meet them Advancing from his caveHail worthy TimonOur late noble masterHave I once liv'd to see two honest menSir Having often of your open bounty tasted Hearing you were retir'd your friends fall'n off Whose thankless natures O abhorred spirits Not all the whips of heaven are large enough What to you Whose starlike nobleness gave life and influence To their whole being I am rapt

work for me there's payment hence To theYou are an alchemist make gold of that Out rascal dogsBeats and drives them outand two It is vain that you would speak with Timon For he is set so only to himself That nothing but himself which looks like man Is friendly with himBring us to his cave It is our part and promise to th' Athenians To speak with TimonAt all times alike Men are not still the same 'twas time and griefs That fram'd him thus Time with his fairer hand Offering the fortunes of his former days The former man may make him Bring us to him And chance it as it mayHere is his cave Peace and content be here Lord Timon Timon Look out and speak to friends Th' Athenians By two of their most reverend Senate greet thee Speak to them noble Timon out of his caveThou sun that comforts burn Speak and be hang'd For each true word a blister and each false Be as a cauterizing to the root o' th' tongue Consuming it with speakingWorthy TimonOf none but such as you and you of TimonThe senators of Athens greet thee TimonI thank them and would send them back the plague Could I but catch it for themO forget What we are sorry for ourselves in thee The senators with one consent of love Entreat thee back to Athens who have thought On special dignities which vacant lie For thy best use and wearingThey confess Toward thee forgetfulness too general gross Which now the public body which doth seldom Play the recanter feeling in itself A lack of Timon's aid hath sense withal Of it own fail restraining aid to Timon And send forth us to make their sorrowed render Together with a recompense more fruitful Than their offence can weigh down by the dram Ay even such heaps and sums of love and wealth As shall to thee blot out what wrongs were theirs And write in thee the figures of their love Ever to read them thineYou witch me in it Surprise me to the very brink of tears Lend me a fool's heart and a woman's eyes And I'll beweep these comforts worthy senatorsTherefore so please thee to return with us And of our Athens thine and ours to take The captainship thou shalt be met with thanks Allow'd with absolute power and thy good name Live with authority So soon we shall drive back Of Alcibiades th' approaches wild Who like a boar too savage doth root up His country's peaceAnd shakes his threat'ning sword Against the walls of AthensTherefore TimonWell sir I will Therefore I will sir thus If Alcibiades kill my countrymen Let Alcibiades know this of Timon That Timon cares not But if he sack fair Athens And take our goodly aged men by th' beards Giving our holy virgins to the stain Of contumelious beastly madbrain'd war Then let him know and tell him Timon speaks it In pity of our aged and our youth I cannot choose but tell him that I care not And let him take't at worst for their knives care not While you have throats to answer For myself There's not a whittle in th' unruly camp But I do prize it at my love before The reverend'st throat in Athens So I leave you To the protection of the prosperous gods As thieves to keepersStay not all's in vainWhy I was writing of my epitaph It will be seen tomorrow My long sickness Of health and living now begins to mend And nothing brings me all things Go live still Be Alcibiades your plague you his And last so long enoughWe speak in vainBut yet I love my country and am not One that rejoices in the common wreck As common bruit doth put itThat's well spokeCommend me to my loving countrymenThese words become your lips as they pass through themAndin our ears like great triumphers In their applauding gatesCommend me to them And tell them that to ease them of their griefs Their fears of hostile strokes their aches losses Their pangs of love with other incident throes That nature's fragile vessel doth sustain In life's uncertain voyage I will some kindness do them I'll teach them to prevent wild Alcibiades' wrathI like this well he will return againI have a tree which grows here in my close That mine own use invites me to cut down And shortly must I fell it Tell my friends Tell Athens in the sequence of degree From high to low throughout that whoso please To stop affliction let him take his haste Come hither ere my tree hath felt the axe And hang himself I pray you do my greetingTrouble him no further thus you still shall find himCome not to me again but say to Athens Timon hath made his everlasting mansion Upon the beached verge of the salt flood Who once a day with his embossed froth The turbulent surge shall cover Thither come And let my gravestone be your oracle Lips let sour words go by and language end What is amiss plague and infection mend Graves only be men's works and death their gain Sun hide thy beams Timon hath done his reigninto his caveHis discontents are unremovably Coupled to natureOur hope in him is dead Let us return And strain what other means is left unto us In our dear perilIt requires swift footBefore the walls of Athenstwo other with a Thou hast painfully discover'd are his files As full as thy reportI have spoke the least Besides his expedition promises Present approachWe stand much hazard if they bring not TimonI met a courier one mine ancient friend Whom though in general part we were oppos'd Yet our old love had a particular force And made us speak like friends This man was riding From Alcibiades to Timon's cave With letters of entreaty which imported His fellowship i' th' cause against your city In part for his sake mov'd the otherfrom Here come our brothersNo talk of Timon nothing of him expect The enemies' drum is heard and fearful scouring Doth choke the air with dust In and prepare Ours is the fall I fear our foes the snare The 's cave and a rude tomb seena in the woods seeking By all description this should be the place Who's here Speak ho No answer What is this Timon is dead who hath outstretch'd his span Some beast rear'd this here does not live a man Dead sure and this his grave What's on this tomb I cannot read the character I'll take with wax Our captain hath in every figure skill An ag'd interpreter though young in days Before proud Athens he's set down by this Whose fall the mark of his ambition is Before the walls of Athens Trumpets soundwith his powers before AthensSound to this coward and lascivious town Our terrible approachSound a parley The appear upon the walls Till now you have gone on and fill'd the time With all licentious measure making your wills The scope of justice till now myself and such As slept within the shadow of your power Have wander'd with our travers'd arms and breath'd Our sufferance vainly Now the time is flush When crouching marrow in the bearer strong Cries of itself 'No more' Now breathless wrong Shall sit and pant in your great chairs of ease And pursy insolence shall break his wind With fear and horrid flightNoble and young When thy first griefs were but a mere conceit Ere thou hadst power or we had cause of fear We sent to thee to give thy rages balm To wipe out our ingratitude with loves Above their quantitySo did we woo Transformed Timon to our city's love By humble message and by promis'd means We were not all unkind nor all deserve The common stroke of warThese walls of ours Were not erected by their hands from whom You have receiv'd your griefs nor are they such That these great tow'rs trophies and schools should fall For private faults in themNor are they living Who were the motives that you first went out Shame that they wanted cunning in excess Hath broke their hearts March noble lord Into our city with thy banners spread By decimation and a tithed death If thy revenges hunger for that food Which nature loathes take thou the destin'd tenth And by the hazard of the spotted die Let die the spottedAll have not offended For those that were it is not square to take On those that are revenge crimes like lands Are not inherited Then dear countryman Bring in thy ranks but leave without thy rage Spare thy Athenian cradle and those kin Which in the bluster of thy wrath must fall With those that have offended Like a shepherd Approach the fold and cull th' infected forth But kill not all togetherWhat thou wilt Thou rather shalt enforce it with thy smile Than hew to't with thy swordSet but thy foot Against our rampir'd gates and they shall ope So thou wilt send thy gentle heart before To say thou'tfriendlyThrow thy glove Or any token of thine honour else That thou wilt use the wars as thy redress And not as our confusion all thy powers Shall make their harbour in our town till we Have seal'd thy full desireThen there's my glove Descend and open your uncharged ports Those enemies of Timon's and mine own Whom you yourselves shall set out for reproof Fall and no more And to atone your fears With my more noble meaning not a man Shall pass his quarter or offend the stream Of regular justice in your city's bounds But shall be render'd to your public laws At heaviest answer'Tis most nobly spokenDescend and keep your wordsThe descend and open the gates a as a MessengerMy noble General Timon is dead Entomb'd upon the very hem o' th' sea And on his gravestone this insculpture which With wax I brought away whose soft impression Interprets for my poor ignorance reads the Epitaph 'Here lies a wretched corse of wretched soul bereft Seek not my name A plague consume you wicked caitiffs left Here lie I Timon who alive all living men did hate Pass by and curse thy fill but pass and stay not here thy gait' These well express in thee thy latter spirits Though thou abhorr'dst in us our human griefs Scorn'dst our brain's flow and those our droplets which From niggard nature fall yet rich conceit Taught thee to make vast Neptune weep for aye On thy low grave on faults forgiven Dead Is noble Timon of whose memory Hereafter more Bring me into your city And I will use the olive with my sword Make war breed peace make peace stint war make each Prescribe to other as each other's leech Let our drums strike
