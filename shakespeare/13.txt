A lawn before thepalaceand I pray thee Rosalind sweet my coz be merryDear Celia I show more mirth than I am mistress of and would you yet I were merrier Unless you could teach me to forget a banished father you must not learn me how to remember any extraordinary pleasureHerein I see thou lov'st me not with the full weight that I love thee If my uncle thy banished father had banished thy uncle the Duke my father so thou hadst been still with me I could have taught my love to take thy father for mine so wouldst thou if the truth of thy love to me were so righteously temper'd as mine is to theeWell I will forget the condition of my estate to rejoice in yoursYou know my father hath no child but I nor none is like to have and truly when he dies thou shalt be his heir for what he hath taken away from thy father perforce I will render thee again in affection By mine honour I will and when I break that oath let me turn monster therefore my sweet Rose my dear Rose be merryFrom henceforth I will coz and devise sports Let me see what think you of falling in loveMarry I prithee do to make sport withal but love no man in good earnest nor no further in sport neither than with safety of a pure blush thou mayst in honour come off againWhat shall be our sport thenLet us sit and mock the good housewife Fortune from her wheel that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equallyI would we could do so for her benefits are mightily misplaced and the bountiful blind woman doth most mistake in her gifts to women'Tis true for those that she makes fair she scarce makes honest and those that she makes honest she makes very illfavouredlyNay now thou goest from Fortune's office to Nature's Fortune reigns in gifts of the world not in the lineaments of Nature No when Nature hath made a fair creature may she not by Fortune fall into the fire Though Nature hath given us wit to flout at Fortune hath not Fortune sent in this fool to cut off the argumentIndeed there is Fortune too hard for Nature when Fortune makes Nature's natural the cutteroff of Nature's witPeradventure this is not Fortune's work neither but Nature's who perceiveth our natural wits too dull to reason of such goddesses and hath sent this natural for our whetstone for always the dullness of the fool is the whetstone of the wits How now wit Whither wander youMistress you must come away to your fatherWere you made the messengerNo by mine honour but I was bid to come for youWhere learned you that oath foolOf a certain knight that swore by his honour they were good pancakes and swore by his honour the mustard was naught Now I'll stand to it the pancakes were naught and the mustard was good and yet was not the knight forswornHow prove you that in the great heap of your knowledgeAy marry now unmuzzle your wisdomStand you both forth now stroke your chins and swear by your beards that I am a knaveBy our beards if we had them thou artBy my knavery if I had it then I were But if you swear by that that not you are not forsworn no more was this knight swearing by his honour for he never had any or if he had he had sworn it away before ever he saw those pancackes or that mustardPrithee who is't that thou mean'stOne that old Frederick your father lovesMy father's love is enough to honour him Enough speak no more of him you'll be whipt for taxation one of these daysThe more pity that fools may not speak wisely what wise men do foolishlyBy my troth thou sayest true for since the little wit that fools have was silenced the little foolery that wise men have makes a great show Here comes Monsieur Le BeauWith his mouth full of newsWhich he will put on us as pigeons feed their youngThen shall we be newscramm'dAll the better we shall be the more marketable Bon jour Monsieur Le Beau What's the

you the beginning and if it please your ladyships you may see the end for the best is yet to do and here where you are they are coming to perform itWell the beginning that is dead and buried There comes an old man and his three sonsI could match this beginning with an old tale Three proper young men of excellent growth and presenceWith bills on their necks 'Be it known unto all men by these presents' The eldest of the three wrestled with Charles the Duke's wrestler which Charles in a moment threw him and broke three of his ribs that there is little hope of life in him So he serv'd the second and so the third Yonder they lie the poor old man their father making such pitiful dole over them that all the beholders take his part with weepingAlasBut what is the sport monsieur that the ladies have lost Why this that I speak ofThus men may grow wiser every day It is the first time that ever I heard breaking of ribs was sport for ladiesOr I I promise theeBut is there any else longs to see this broken music in his sides Is there yet another dotes upon ribbreaking Shall we see this wrestling cousin You must if you stay here for here is the place appointed for the wrestling and they

the general challenger I come but in as others do to try with him the strength of my youthYoung gentleman your spirits are too bold for your years You have seen cruel proof of this man's strength if you saw yourself with your eyes or knew yourself with your judgment the fear of your adventure would counsel you to a more equal prise We pray you for your own sake to embrace your own safety and give over this attemptDo young sir your reputation shall not therefore be misprised we will make it our suit to the Duke that the wrestling might not go forwardI beseech you punish me not with your hard thoughts wherein I confess me much guilty to deny so fair and excellent ladies any thing But let your fair eyes and gentle wishes go with me to my trial wherein if I be foil'd there is but one sham'd that was never gracious if kill'd but one dead that is willing to be so I shall do my friends no wrong for I have none to lament me the world no injury for in it I have nothing only in the world I fill up a place which may be better supplied when I have made it emptyThe little strength that I have I would it were with youAnd mine to eke out hersFare you well Pray heaven I be deceiv'd in youYour heart's desires be with youCome where is this young gallant that is so desirous to lie with his mother earthReady sir but his will hath in it a more modest workingYou shall try but one fallNo I warrant your Grace you shall not entreat him to a second that have so mightily persuaded him from a firstYou mean to mock me after you should not have mock'd me before but come your waysNow Hercules be thy speed young manI would I were invisible to catch the strong fellow by the legThey wrestleO excellent young manIf I had a thunderbolt in mine eye I can tell who should down is thrown ShoutNo

BoysI would thou hadst been son to some man else The world esteem'd thy father honourable But I did find him still mine enemy Thou shouldst have better pleas'd me with this deed Hadst thou descended from another house But fare thee well thou art a gallant youth I would thou hadst told me of another fathertrain andWere I my father coz would I do thisI am more proud to be Sir Rowland's son His youngest son and would not change that calling To be adopted heir to FrederickMy father lov'd Sir Rowland as his soul And all the world was of my father's mind Had I before known this young man his son I should have given him tears unto entreaties Ere he should thus have ventur'dGentle cousin Let us go thank him and encourage him My father's rough and envious disposition Sticks me at heart Sir you have well deserv'd If you do keep your promises in love But justly as you have exceeded all promise Your mistress shall be happyGentlemanGiving him a chain from her neck Wear this for me one out of suits with fortune That could give more but that her hand lacks means Shall we go cozAy Fare you well fair gentlemanCan I not say 'I thank you' My better parts Are all thrown down and that which here stands up Is but a quintain a mere lifeless blockHe calls us back My pride fell with my fortunes I'll ask him what he would Did you call sir Sir you have wrestled well and overthrown More than your enemiesWill you go cozHave with you Fare you well What passion hangs these weights upon my tongue I cannot speak to her yet she urg'd conference O poor Orlando thou art overthrown Or Charles or something weaker masters thee Re Good sir I do in friendship counsel you To leave this place Albeit you have deserv'd High commendation true applause and love Yet such is now the Duke's condition That he misconstrues all that you have done The Duke is humorous what he is indeed More suits you to conceive than I to speak ofI thank you sir and pray you tell me this Which of the two was daughter of the Duke That here was at the wrestling Neither his daughter if we judge by manners But yet indeed the smaller is his daughter The other is daughter to the banish'd Duke And here detain'd by her usurping uncle To keep his daughter company whose loves Are dearer than the natural bond of sisters But I can tell you that of late this Duke Hath ta'en displeasure 'gainst his gentle niece Grounded upon no other argument But that the people praise her for her virtues And pity her for her good father's sake And on my life his malice 'gainst the lady Will suddenly break forth Sir fare you well Hereafter in a better world than this I shall desire more love and knowledge of youI rest much bounden to you fare you wellThus must I from the smoke into the smother From tyrant Duke unto a tyrant brother But heavenly RosalindThe 's palaceand Why cousin why Rosalind Cupid have mercy Not a wordNot one to throw at a dogNo thy words are too precious to be cast away upon curs throw some of them at me come lame me with reasonsThen there were two cousins laid up when the one should be lam'd with reasons and the other mad without anyBut is all this for your fatherNo some of it is for my child's father O how full of briers is this workingday worldThey are but burs cousin thrown upon thee in holiday foolery if we walk not in the trodden paths our very petticoats will catch themI could shake them off my coat these burs are in my heartHem them awayI would try if I could cry 'hem' and have himCome come wrestle with thy affectionsO they take the part of a better wrestler than myselfO a good wish upon you You will try in time in despite of a fall But turning these jests out of service let us talk in good earnest Is it possible on such a sudden you should fall into so strong a liking with old Sir Rowland's youngest sonThe Duke my father lov'd his father dearlyDoth it therefore ensue that you should love his son dearly By this kind of chase I should hate him for my father hated his father dearly yet I hate not OrlandoNo faith hate him not for my sakeWhy should I not Doth he not deserve well with Let me love him for that and do you love him because I do Look here comes the DukeWith his eyes full of angerMistress dispatch you with your safest haste And get you from our courtMe uncleYou cousin Within these ten days if that thou beest found So near our public court as twenty miles Thou diest for itI do beseech your Grace Let me the knowledge of my fault bear with me If with myself I hold intelligence Or have acquaintance with mine own desires If that I do not dream or be not frantic As I do trust I am not then dear uncle Never so much as in a thought unborn Did I offend your HighnessThus do all traitors If their purgation did consist in words They are as innocent as grace itself Let it suffice thee that I trust thee notYet your mistrust cannot make me a traitor Tell me whereon the likelihood dependsThou art thy father's daughter there's enough was I when your Highness took his dukedom So was I when your Highness banish'd him Treason is not inherited my lord Or if we did derive it from our friends What's that to me My father was no traitor Then good my liege mistake me not so much To think my poverty is treacherousDear sovereign hear me speakAy Celia we stay'd her for your sake Else had she with her father rang'd alongI did not then entreat to have her stay It was your pleasure and your own remorse I was too young that time to value her But now I know her If she be a traitor Why so am I we still have slept together Rose at an instant learn'd play'd eat together And wheresoe'er we went like Juno's swans Still we went coupled and inseparableShe is too subtle for thee and her smoothness Her very silence and her patience Speak to the people and they pity her Thou art a fool She robs thee of thy name And thou wilt show more bright and seem more virtuous When she is gone Then open not thy lips Firm and irrevocable is my doom Which I have pass'd upon her she is banish'dPronounce that sentence then on me my liege I cannot live out of her companyYou are a fool You niece provide yourself If you outstay the time upon mine honour And in the greatness of my word you die O my poor Rosalind Whither wilt thou go Wilt thou change fathers I will give thee mine I charge thee be not thou more griev'd than I amI have more causeThou hast not cousin Prithee be cheerful Know'st thou not the Duke Hath banish'd me his daughterThat he hath notNo hath not Rosalind lacks then the love Which teacheth thee that thou and I am one Shall we be sund'red Shall we part sweet girl No let my father seek another heir Therefore devise with me how we may fly Whither to go and what to bear with us And do not seek to take your charge upon you To bear your griefs yourself and leave me out For by this heaven now at our sorrows pale Say what thou canst I'll go along with theeWhy whither shall we goTo seek my uncle in the Forest of ArdenAlas what danger will it be to us Maids as we are to travel forth so far Beauty provoketh thieves sooner than goldI'll put myself in poor and mean attire And with a kind of umber smirch my face The like do you so shall we pass along And never stir assailantsWere it not better Because that I am more than common tall That I did suit me all points like a man A gallant curtleaxe upon my thigh A boar spear in my hand and in my heart Lie there what hidden woman's fear there will We'll have a swashing and a martial outside As many other mannish cowards have That do outface it with their semblancesWhat shall I call thee when thou art a manI'll have no worse a name than Jove's own page And therefore look you call me Ganymede But what will you be call'dSomething that hath a reference to my state No longer Celia but AlienaBut cousin what if we assay'd to steal The clownish fool out of your father's court Would he not be a comfort to our travelHe'll go along o'er the wide world with me Leave me alone to woo him Let's away And get our jewels and our wealth together Devise the fittest time and safest way To hide us from pursuit that will be made After my flight Now go we in content To liberty and not to banishment
