Rome A streetthe andwith ' two sons and bound passing on the stage to the place of execution and going before pleadingHear me grave fathers noble Tribunes stay For pity of mine age whose youth was spent In dangerous wars whilst you securely slept For all my blood in Rome's great quarrel shed For all the frosty nights that I have watch'd And for these bitter tears which now you see Filling the aged wrinkles in my cheeks Be pitiful to my condemned sons Whose souls are not corrupted as 'tis thought For two and twenty sons I never wept Because they died in honour's lofty bed lieth down and the judgespass by him with the prisoners and exeunt For these Tribunes in the dust I write My heart's deep languor and my soul's sad tears Let my tears stanch the earth's dry appetite My sons' sweet blood will make it shame and blush O earth I will befriend thee more with rain That shall distil from these two ancient urns Than youthful April shall with all his show'rs In summer's drought I'll drop upon thee still In winter with warm tears I'll melt the snow And keep eternal springtime on thy face So thou refuse to drink my dear sons' blood Lucius with his weapon drawn O reverend Tribunes O gentle aged men Unbind my sons reverse the doom of death And let me say that never wept before My tears are now prevailing oratorsO noble father you lament in vain The Tribunes hear you not no man is by And you recount your sorrows to a stoneAh Lucius for thy brothers let me plead Grave Tribunes once more I entreat of youMy gracious lord no tribune hears you speakWhy 'tis no matter man if they did hear They would not mark me if they did mark They would not pity me yet plead I must And bootless unto them Therefore I tell my sorrows to the stones Who though they cannot answer my distress Yet in some sort they are better than the Tribunes For that they will not intercept my tale When I do weep they humbly at my feet Receive my tears and seem to weep with me And were they but attired in grave weeds Rome could afford no tribunes like to these A stone is soft as wax tribunes more hard than stones A stone is silent and offendeth not And tribunes with their tongues doom men to deathRises But wherefore stand'st thou with thy weapon drawnTo rescue my two brothers from their death For which attempt the judges have pronounc'd My everlasting doom of banishmentO happy man they have befriended thee Why foolish Lucius dost thou not perceive That Rome is but a wilderness of tigers Tigers must prey and Rome affords no prey But me and mine how happy art thou then From these devourers to be banished But who comes with our brother Marcus here with Titus prepare thy aged eyes to weep Or if not so thy noble heart to break I bring consuming sorrow to thine ageWill it consume me Let me see it thenThis was thy daughterWhy Marcus so she isAy me this object kills meFainthearted boy arise and look upon her Speak Lavinia what accursed hand Hath made thee handless in thy father's sight What fool hath added water to the sea Or brought a fagot to brightburning Troy My grief was at the height before thou cam'st And now like Nilus it disdaineth bounds Give me a sword I'll chop off my hands too For they have fought for Rome and all in vain And they have nurs'd this woe in feeding life In bootless prayer have they been held up And they have serv'd me to effectless use Now all the service I require of them Is that the one will help to cut the other 'Tis well Lavinia that thou hast no hands For hands to do Rome service is but vainSpeak gentle sister who hath martyr'd theeO that delightful engine of her thoughts That blabb'd them with such pleasing eloquence Is torn from forth that pretty hollow cage Where like a sweet melodious bird it sung Sweet varied notes enchanting every earO say thou for her who hath done this deedO thus I found her straying in the park Seeking to hide herself as doth the deer That hath receiv'd some unrecuring woundIt was my dear and he that wounded her Hath hurt me more than had he kill'd me dead For now I stand as one upon a rock Environ'd with a wilderness of sea Who marks the waxing tide grow wave by wave Expecting ever when some envious surge Will in his brinish bowels swallow him This way to death my wretched sons are gone Here stands my other son a banish'd man And here my brother weeping at my woes But that which gives my soul the greatest spurn Is dear Lavinia dearer than my soul Had I but seen thy picture in this plight It would have madded me what shall I do Now I behold thy lively body so Thou hast no hands to wipe away thy tears Nor tongue to tell me who hath martyr'd thee Thy husband he is dead and for his death Thy brothers are condemn'd and dead by this Look Marcus Ah son Lucius look on her When I did name her brothers then fresh tears Stood on her cheeks as doth the honey dew Upon a gath'red lily almost witheredPerchance she weeps because they kill'd her husband Perchance because she knows them innocentIf they did kill thy husband then be joyful Because the law hath ta'en revenge on them No no they would not do so foul a deed Witness the sorrow that their sister makes Gentle Lavinia let me kiss thy lips Or make some sign how I may do thee ease Shall thy good uncle and thy brother Lucius And thou and I sit round about some fountain Looking all downwards to behold our cheeks How they are stain'd like meadows yet not dry With miry slime left on them by a flood And in the fountain shall we gaze so long Till the fresh taste be taken from that clearness And made a brinepit with our bitter tears Or shall we cut away our hands like thine Or shall we bite our tongues and in dumb shows Pass the remainder of our hateful days What shall we do Let us that have our tongues Plot some device of further misery To make us wonder'd at in time to comeSweet father cease your tears for at your grief See how my wretched sister sobs and weepsPatience dear niece Good Titus dry thine eyesAh Marcus Marcus Brother well I wot Thy napkin cannot drink a tear of mine For thou poor man hast drown'd it with thine ownAh my Lavinia I will wipe thy cheeksMark Marcus mark I understand her signs Had she a tongue to speak now would she say That to her brother which I said to thee His napkin with his true tears all bewet Can do no service on her sorrowful cheeks O what a sympathy of woe is this As far from help as Limbo is from bliss the MoorTitus Andronicus my lord the Emperor Sends thee this word that if thou love thy sons Let Marcus Lucius or thyself old Titus Or any one of you chop off your hand And send it to the King he for the same Will send thee hither both thy sons alive And that shall be the ransom for their faultO gracious Emperor O gentle Aaron Did ever raven sing so like a lark That gives sweet tidings of the sun's uprise With all my heart I'll send the Emperor my hand Good Aaron wilt thou help to chop it offStay father for that noble hand of thine That hath thrown down so many enemies Shall not be sent My hand will serve the turn My youth can better spare my blood than you And therefore mine shall save my brothers' livesWhich of your hands hath not defended Rome And rear'd aloft the bloody battleaxe Writing destruction on the enemy's castle O none of both but are of high desert My hand hath been but idle let it serve To ransom my two nephews from their death Then have I kept it to a worthy endNay come agree whose hand shall go along For fear they die before their pardon comeMy hand shall goBy heaven it shall not goSirs strive no more such with'red herbs as these Are meet for plucking up and therefore mineSweet father if I shall be thought thy son Let me redeem my brothers both from deathAnd for our father's sake and mother's care Now let me show a brother's love to theeAgree between you I will spare my handThen I'll go fetch an axeBut I will use the axeCome hither Aaron I'll deceive them both Lend me thy hand and I will give thee mine AsideIf that be call'd deceit I will be honest And never whilst I live deceive men so But I'll deceive you in another sort And that you'll say ere half an hour passHe cuts off ' handRe andNow stay your strife What shall be is dispatch'd Good Aaron give his Majesty my hand Tell him it was a hand that warded him From thousand dangers bid him bury it More hath it merited that let it have As for my sons say I account of them As jewels purchas'd at an easy price And yet dear too because I bought mine ownI go Andronicus and for thy hand Look by and by to have thy sons with thee AsideTheir heads I mean O how this villainy Doth fat me with the very thoughts of it Let fools do good and fair men call for grace Aaron will have his soul black like his face O here I lift this one hand up to heaven And bow this feeble ruin to the earth If any power pities wretched tears To that I callTo What would'st thou kneel with me Do then dear heart for heaven shall hear our prayers Or with our sighs we'll breathe the welkin dim And stain the sun with fog as sometime clouds When they do hug him in their melting bosomsO brother speak with possibility And do not break into these deep extremesIs not my sorrow deep having no bottom Then be my passions bottomless with themBut yet let reason govern thy lamentIf there were reason for these miseries Then into limits could I bind my woes When heaven doth weep doth not the earth o'erflow If the winds rage doth not the sea wax mad Threat'ning the welkin with his bigswol'n face And wilt thou have a reason for this coil I am the sea hark how her sighs do blow She is the weeping welkin I the earth Then must my sea be moved with her sighs Then must my earth with her continual tears Become a deluge overflow'd and drown'd For why my bowels cannot hide her woes But like a drunkard must I vomit them Then give me leave for losers will have leave To ease their stomachs with their bitter tonguesawith two heads and a handWorthy Andronicus ill art thou repaid For that good hand thou sent'st the Emperor Here are the heads of thy two noble sons And here's thy hand in scorn to thee sent back Thy grief their sports thy resolution mock'd That woe is me to think upon thy woes More than remembrance of my father's death Now let hot Aetna cool in Sicily And be my heart an everburning hell These miseries are more than may be borne To weep with them that weep doth ease some deal But sorrow flouted at is double deathAh that this sight should make so deep a wound And yet detested life not shrink thereat That ever death should let life bear his name Where life hath no more interest but to breathe kisses Alas poor heart that kiss is comfortless As frozen water to a starved snakeWhen will this fearful slumber have an endNow farewell flatt'ry die Andronicus Thou dost not slumber see thy two sons' heads Thy warlike hand thy mangled daughter here Thy other banish'd son with this dear sight Struck pale and bloodless and thy brother I Even like a stony image cold and numb Ah now no more will I control thy griefs Rent off thy silver hair thy other hand Gnawing with thy teeth and be this dismal sight The closing up of our most wretched eyes Now is a time to storm why art thou stillHa ha haWhy dost thou laugh It fits not with this hourWhy I have not another tear to shed Besides this sorrow is an enemy And would usurp upon my wat'ry eyes And make them blind with tributary tears Then which way shall I find Revenge's cave For these two heads do seem to speak to me And threat me I shall never come to bliss Till all these mischiefs be return'd again Even in their throats that have committed them Come let me see what task I have to do You heavy people circle me about That I may turn me to each one of you And swear unto my soul to right your wrongs The vow is made Come brother take a head And in this hand the other will I bear And Lavinia thou shalt be employ'd in this Bear thou my hand sweet wench between thy teeth As for thee boy go get thee from my sight Thou art an exile and thou must not stay Hie to the Goths and raise an army there And if ye love me as I think you do Let's kiss and part for we have much to do all but LuciusFarewell Andronicus my noble father The woefull'st man that ever liv'd in Rome Farewell proud Rome till Lucius come again He leaves his pledges dearer than his life Farewell Lavinia my noble sister O would thou wert as thou tofore hast been But now nor Lucius nor Lavinia lives But in oblivion and hateful griefs If Lucius live he will requite your wrongs And make proud Saturnine and his emperess Beg at the gates like Tarquin and his queen Now will I to the Goths and raise a pow'r To be reveng'd on Rome and Saturnine Rome ' house A banquet and the boy So so now sit and look you eat no more Than will preserve just so much strength in us As will revenge these bitter woes of ours Marcus unknit that sorrowwreathen knot Thy niece and I poor creatures want our hands And cannot passionate our tenfold grief With folded arms This poor right hand of mine Is left to tyrannize upon my breast Who when my heart all mad with misery Beats in this hollow prison of my flesh Then thus I thump it down To Thou map of woe that thus dost talk in signs When thy poor heart beats with outrageous beating Thou canst not strike it thus to make it still Wound it with sighing girl kill it with groans Or get some little knife between thy teeth And just against thy heart make thou a hole That all the tears that thy poor eyes let fall May run into that sink and soaking in Drown the lamenting fool in seasalt tearsFie brother fie Teach her not thus to lay Such violent hands upon her tender lifeHow now Has sorrow made thee dote already Why Marcus no man should be mad butWhat violent hands can she lay on her life Ah wherefore dost thou urge the name of hands To bid Aeneas tell the tale twice o'er How Troy was burnt and he made miserable O handle not the theme to talk of hands Lest we remember still that we have none Fie fie how franticly I square my talk As if we should forget we had no hands If Marcus did not name the word of hands Come let's fall to and gentle girl eat this Here is no drink Hark Marcus what she says I can interpret all her martyr'd signs She says she drinks no other drink but tears Brew'd with her sorrow mesh'd upon her cheeks Speechless complainer I will learn thy thought In thy dumb action will I be as perfect As begging hermits in their holy prayers Thou shalt not sigh nor hold thy stumps to heaven Nor wink nor nod nor kneel nor make a sign But I of these will wrest an alphabet And by still practice learn to know thy meaningGood grandsire leave these bitter deep laments Make my aunt merry with some pleasing taleAlas the tender boy in passion mov'd Doth weep to see his grandsire's heavinessPeace tender sapling thou art made of tears And tears will quickly melt thy life away strikes the dish with a knife What dost thou strike at Marcus with thy knifeAt that that I have kill'd my lord a flyOut on thee murderer thou kill'st my heart Mine eyes are cloy'd with view of tyranny A deed of death done on the innocent Becomes not Titus' brother Get thee gone I see thou art not for my companyAlas my lord I have but kill'd a fly'But' How if that fly had a father and mother How would he hang his slender gilded wings And buzz lamenting doings in the air Poor harmless fly That with his pretty buzzing melody Came here to make us merry And thou hast kill'd himPardon me sir it was a black illfavour'd fly Like to the Empress' Moor therefore I kill'd himO O O Then pardon me for reprehending thee For thou hast done a charitable deed Give me thy knife I will insult on him Flattering myself as if it were the Moor Come hither purposely to poison me There's for thyself and that's for Tamora Ah sirrah Yet I think we are not brought so low But that between us we can kill a fly That comes in likeness of a coalblack MoorAlas poor man grief has so wrought on him He takes false shadows for true substancesCome take away Lavinia go with me I'll to thy closet and go read with thee Sad stories chanced in the times of old Come boy and go with me thy sight is young And thou shalt read when mine begin to dazzle
