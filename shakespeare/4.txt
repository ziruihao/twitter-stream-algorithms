wherein the honour Of my dear father's gift stands chief in power I come to tender it and my appliance With all bound humblenessWe thank you maiden But may not be so credulous of cure When our most learned doctors leave us and The congregated college have concluded That labouring art can never ransom nature From her inaidable estateI say we must not So stain our judgment or corrupt our hope To prostitute our pastcure malady To empirics or to dissever so Our great self and our credit to esteem A senseless help when help past sense we deemMy duty then shall pay me for my pains I will no more enforce mine office on you Humbly entreating from your royal thoughts A modest one to bear me back againI cannot give thee less to be call'd grateful Thou thought'st to help me and such thanks I give

remedy He that of greatest works is finisher Oft does them by the weakest minister So holy writ in babes hath judgment shown When judges have been babes Great floods have flown From simple sources and great seas have dried When miracles have by the greatest been denied Oft expectation fails and most oft there Where most it promises and oft it hits Where hope is coldest and despair most fitsI must
