 Brutus in his orchardWhat Lucius ho I cannot by the progress of the stars Give guess how near to day Lucius I say I would it were my fault to sleep so soundly When Lucius when Awake I say What LuciusLuciusCall'd you my lordGet me a taper in my study Lucius When it is lighted come and call me hereI will my lord It must be by his death and for my part I know no personal cause to spurn at him But for the general He would be crown'd How that might change his nature there's the question It is the bright day that brings forth the adder And that craves wary walking Crown him that And then I grant we put a sting in him That at his will he may do danger with The abuse of greatness is when it disjoins Remorse from power and to speak truth of Caesar I have not known when his affections sway'd More than his reason But 'tis a common proof That lowliness is young ambition's ladder Whereto the climberupward turns his face But when he once attains the upmost round He then unto the ladder turns his back Looks in the clouds scorning the base degrees By which he did ascend So Caesar may Then lest he may prevent And since the quarrel Will bear no color for the thing he is Fashion it thus that what he is augmented Would run to these and these extremities And therefore think him as a serpent's egg Which hatch'd would as his kind grow mischievous And kill him in the shell Re LuciusThe taper burneth in your closet sir Searching the window for a flint I found This paper thus seal'd up and I am sure It did not lie there when I went to bedGives him the letterGet you to bed again it is not day Is not tomorrow boy the ides of MarchI know not sirLook in the calendar and bring me wordI will sir The exhalations whizzing in the air Give so much light that I may read by themOpens the letter and reads Brutus thou sleep'st awake and see thyself Shall Rome etc Speak strike redress Brutus thou sleep'st awake Such instigations have been often dropp'd Where I have took them up Shall Rome etc Thus must I piece it out Shall Rome stand under one man's awe What Rome My ancestors did from the streets of Rome The Tarquin drive when he was call'd a king Speak strike redress Am I entreated To speak and strike O Rome I make thee promise If the redress will follow thou receivest Thy full petition at the hand of Brutus Re LuciusSir March is wasted fifteen days Knocking within'Tis good Go to the gate somebody knocksLucius Since Cassius first did whet me against Caesar I have not slept Between the acting of a dreadful thing And the first motion all the interim is Like a phantasma or a hideous dream The genius and the mortal instruments Are then in council and the state of man Like to a little kingdom suffers then The nature of an insurrectionRe LuciusSir 'tis your brother Cassius at the door Who doth desire to see youIs he aloneNo sir there are more with himDo you know themNo sir their hats are pluck'd about their ears And half their faces buried in their cloaks That by no means I may discover them By any mark of favorLet 'emLucius They are the faction O Conspiracy Shamest thou to show thy dangerous brow by night When evils are most free O then by day Where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough To mask thy monstrous visage Seek none Conspiracy Hide it in smiles and affability For if thou path thy native semblance on Not Erebus itself were dim enough To hide thee from preventionthe conspirators Cassius Casca Decius Cinna Metellus Cimber and TreboniusI think we are too bold upon your rest Good morrow Brutus do we trouble youI have been up this hour awake all night Know I these men that come along with youYes every man of them and no man here But honors you and every one doth wish You had but that opinion of yourself Which every noble Roman bears of you This is TreboniusHe is welcome hitherThis Decius BrutusHe is welcome tooThis Casca this Cinna and this Metellus CimberThey are all welcome What watchful cares do interpose themselves Betwixt your eyes and nightShall I entreat a word They whisperHere lies the east Doth not the day break hereNoO pardon sir it doth and yongrey lines That fret the clouds are messengers of dayYou shall confess that you are both deceived Here as I point my sword the sun arises Which is a great way growing on the south Weighing the youthful season of the year Some two months hence up higher toward the north He first presents his fire and the high east Stands as the Capitol directly hereGive me your hands all over one by oneAnd let us swear our resolutionNo not an oath If not the face of men The sufferance of our souls the time's abuse If these be motives weak break off betimes And every man hence to his idle bed So let highsighted tyranny range on Till each man drop by lottery But if these As I am sure they do bear fire enough To kindle cowards and to steel with valor The melting spirits of women then countrymen What need we any spur but our own cause To prick us to redress What other bond Than secret Romans that have spoke the word And will not palter And what other oath Than honesty to honesty engaged That this shall be or we will fall for it Swear priests and cowards and men cautelous Old feeble carrions and such suffering souls That welcome wrongs unto bad causes swear Such creatures as men doubt but do not stain The even virtue of our prise Nor the insuppressive mettle of our spirits To think that or our cause or our performance Did need an oath when every drop of blood That every Roman bears and nobly bears Is guilty of a several bastardy If he do break the smallest particle Of any promise that hath pass'd from himBut what of Cicero Shall we sound him I think he will stand very strong with usLet us not leave him outNo by no meansO let us have him for his silver hairs Will purchase us a good opinion And buy men's voices to commend our deeds It shall be said his judgement ruled our hands Our youths and wildness shall no whit appear But all be buried in his gravityO name him not let us not break with him For he will never follow anything That other men beginThen leave him outIndeed he is not fitShall no man else be touch'd but only CaesarDecius well urged I think it is not meet Mark Antony so well beloved of Caesar Should outlive Caesar We shall find of him A shrewd contriver and you know his means If he improve them may well stretch so far As to annoy us all which to prevent Let Antony and Caesar fall togetherOur course will seem too bloody Caius Cassius To cut the head off and then hack the limbs Like wrath in death and envy afterwards For Antony is but a limb of Caesar Let us be sacrificers but not butchers Caius We all stand up against the spirit of Caesar And in the spirit of men there is no blood O that we then could come by Caesar's spirit And not dismember Caesar But alas Caesar must bleed for it And gentle friends Let's kill him boldly but not wrathfully Let's carve him as a dish fit for the gods Not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds And let our hearts as subtle masters do Stir up their servants to an act of rage And after seem to chide 'em This shall make Our purpose necessary and not envious Which so appearing to the common eyes We shall be call'd purgers not murderers And for Mark Antony think not of him For he can do no more than Caesar's arm When Caesar's head is offYet I fear him For in the ingrated love he bears to CaesarAlas good Cassius do not think of him If he love Caesar all that he can do Is to himself take thought and die for Caesar And that were much he should for he is given To sports to wildness and much companyThere is no fear in himlet him not die For he will live and laugh at this hereafter Clock strikesPeace count the clockThe clock hath stricken three'Tis time to partBut it is doubtful yet Whether Caesar will come forth today or no For he is superstitious grown of late Quite from the main opinion he held once Of fantasy of dreams and ceremonies It may be these apparent prodigies The unaccustom'd terror of this night And the persuasion of his augurers May hold him from the Capitol todayNever fear that If he be so resolved I can o'ersway him for he loves to hear That unicorns may be betray'd with trees And bears with glasses elephants with holes Lions with toils and men with flatterers But when I tell him he hates flatterers He says he does being then most flattered Let me work For I can give his humor the true bent And I will bring him to the CapitolNay we will all of us be there to fetch himBy the eighth hour Is that the utter mostBe that the uttermost and fail not thenCaius Ligarius doth bear Caesar hard Who rated him for speaking well of Pompey I wonder none of you have thought of himNow good Metellus go along by him He loves me well and I have given him reasons Send him but hither and I'll fashion himThe morning comes upon 's We'll leave you Brutus And friends disperse yourselves but all remember What you have said and show yourselves true RomansGood gentlemen look fresh and merrily Let not our looks put on our purposes But bear it as our Roman actors do With untired spirits and formal constancy And so good morrow to you every oneall but Brutus Boy Lucius Fast asleep It is no matter Enjoy the honeyheavy dew of slumber Thou hast no figures nor no fantasies Which busy care draws in the brains of men Therefore thou sleep'st so sound PortiaBrutus my lordPortia what mean you Wherefore rise you now It is not for your health thus to commit Your weak condition to the raw cold morningNor for yours neither have ungently Brutus Stole from my bed and yesternight at supper You suddenly arose and walk'd about Musing and sighing with your arms across And when I ask'd you what the matter was You stared upon me with ungentle looks I urged you further then you scratch'd your head And too impatiently stamp'd with your foot Yet I insisted yet you answer'd not But with an angry waiter of your hand Gave sign for me to leave you So I did Fearing to strengthen that impatience Which seem'd too much enkindled and withal Hoping it was but an effect of humor Which sometime hath his hour with every man It will not let you eat nor talk nor sleep And could it work so much upon your shape As it hath much prevail'd on your condition I should not know you Brutus Dear my lord Make me acquainted with your cause of griefI am not well in health and that is allBrutus is wise and were he not in health He would embrace the means to come by itWhy so I do Good Portia go to bedIs Brutus sick and is it physical To walk unbraced and suck up the humors Of the dank morning What is Brutus sick And will he steal out of his wholesome bed To dare the vile contagion of the night And tempt the rheumy and unpurged air To add unto his sickness No my Brutus You have some sick offense within your mind Which by the right and virtue of my place I ought to know of and upon my knees I charm you by my once commended beauty By all your vows of love and that great vow Which did incorporate and make us one That you unfold to me yourself your half Why you are heavy and what men tonight Have had resort to you for here have been Some six or seven who did hide their faces Even from darknessKneel not gentle PortiaI should not need if you were gentle Brutus Within the bond of marriage tell me Brutus Is it excepted I should know no secrets That appertain to you Am I yourself But as it were in sort or limitation To keep with you at meals comfort your bed And talk to you sometimes Dwell I but in the suburbs Of your good pleasure If it be no more Portia is Brutus' harlot not his wifeYou are my true and honorable wife As dear to me as are the ruddy drops That visit my sad heartIf this were true then should I know this secret I grant I am a woman but withal A woman that Lord Brutus took to wife I grant I am a woman but withal A woman well reputed Cato's daughter Think you I am no stronger than my sex Being so father'd and so husbanded Tell me your counsels I will not disclose 'em I have made strong proof of my constancy Giving myself a voluntary wound Here in the thigh Can I bear that with patience And not my husband's secretsO ye gods Render me worthy of this noble wife Knocking within Hark hark one knocks Portia go in awhile And by and by thy bosom shall partake The secrets of my heart All my engagements I will construe to thee All the charactery of my sad brows Leave me with hastePortia Lucius who's that knocks Re Lucius with LigariusHere is a sick man that would speak with youCaius Ligarius that Metellus spake of Boy stand aside Caius Ligarius howVouchsafe good morrow from a feeble tongueO what a time have you chose out brave Caius To wear a kerchief Would you were not sickI am not sick if Brutus have in hand Any exploit worthy the name of honorSuch an exploit have I in hand Ligarius Had you a healthful ear to hear of itBy all the gods that Romans bow before I here discard my sickness Soul of Rome Brave son derived from honorable loins Thou like an exorcist hast conjured up My mortified spirit Now bid me run And I will strive with things impossible Yea get the better of them What's to doA piece of work that will make sick men wholeBut are not some whole that we must make sickThat must we also What it is my Caius I shall unfold to thee as we are going To whom it must be doneSet on your foot And with a heart newfired I follow you To do I know not what but it sufficeth That Brutus leads me onFollow me thenCaesar's house Thunder and lightningCaesar in his nightgownNor heaven nor earth have been at peace tonight Thrice hath Calpurnia in her sleep cried out Help ho They murther Caesar Who's within a ServantMy lordGo bid the priests do present sacrifice And bring me their opinions of successI will my lord CalpurniaWhat mean you Caesar Think you to walk forth You shall not stir out of your house todayCaesar shall forth the things that threaten'd me Ne'er look'd but on my back when they shall see The face of Caesar they are vanishedCaesar I I stood on ceremonies Yet now they fright me There is one within Besides the things that we have heard and seen Recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch A lioness hath whelped in the streets And graves have yawn'd and yielded up their dead Fierce fiery warriors fight upon the clouds In ranks and squadrons and right form of war Which drizzled blood upon the Capitol The noise of battle hurtled in the air Horses did neigh and dying men did groan And ghosts did shriek and squeal about the streets O Caesar These things are beyond all use And I do fear themWhat can be avoided Whose end is purposed by the mighty gods Yet Caesar shall go forth for these predictions Are to the world in general as to CaesarWhen beggars die there are no comets seen The heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princesCowards die many times before their deaths The valiant never taste of death but once Of all the wonders that I yet have heard It seems to me most strange that men should fear Seeing that death a necessary end Will come when it will come Re Servant What say the augurersThey would not have you to stir forth today Plucking the entrails of an offering forth They could not find a heart within the beastThe gods do this in shame of cowardice Caesar should be a beast without a heart If he should stay at home today for fear No Caesar shall not Danger knows full well That Caesar is more dangerous than he We are two lions litter'd in one day And I the elder and more terrible And Caesar shall go forthAlas my lord Your wisdom is consumed in confidence Do not go forth today Call it my fear That keeps you in the house and not your own We'll send Mark Antony to the Senate House And he shall say you are not well today Let me upon my knee prevail in thisMark Antony shall say I am not well And for thy humor I will stay at homeDecius Here's Decius Brutus he shall tell them soCaesar all hail Good morrow worthy Caesar I come to fetch you to the Senate HouseAnd you are come in very happy time To bear my greeting to the senators And tell them that I will not come today Cannot is false and that I dare not falser I will not come today Tell them so DeciusSay he is sickShall Caesar send a lie Have I in conquest stretch'd mine arm so far To be afeard to tell greybeards the truth Decius go tell them Caesar will not comeMost mighty Caesar let me know some cause Lest I be laugh'd at when I tell them soThe cause is in my will I will not come That is enough to satisfy the Senate But for your private satisfaction Because I love you I will let you know Calpurnia here my wife stays me at home She dreamt tonight she saw my statue Which like a fountain with an hundred spouts Did run pure blood and many lusty Romans Came smiling and did bathe their hands in it And these does she apply for warnings and portents And evils imminent and on her knee Hath begg'd that I will stay at home todayThis dream is all amiss interpreted It was a vision fair and fortunate Your statue spouting blood in many pipes In which so many smiling Romans bathed Signifies that from you great Rome shall suck Reviving blood and that great men shall press For tinctures stains relics and cognizance This by Calpurnia's dream is signifiedAnd this way have you well expounded itI have when you have heard what I can say And know it now the Senate have concluded To give this day a crown to mighty Caesar If you shall send them word you will not come Their minds may change Besides it were a mock Apt to be render'd for someone to say Break up the Senate till another time When Caesar's wife shall meet with better dreams If Caesar hide himself shall they not whisper Lo Caesar is afraid Pardon me Caesar for my dear dear love To your proceeding bids me tell you this And reason to my love is liableHow foolish do your fears seem now Calpurnia I am ashamed I did yield to them Give me my robe for I will go Publius Brutus Ligarius Metellus CascaTrebonius and Cinna And look where Publius is come to fetch meGood morrowCaesarWelcome Publius What Brutus are you stirr'd so early too Good morrow Casca Caius Ligarius

nights Is notwithstanding up Good morrow AntonySo to most noble CaesarBid them prepare within I am to blame to be thus waited for Now Cinna now Metellus what Trebonius I have an hour's talk in store

some wine with me And we like friends will straightway go togetherAside That every like is not the same O Caesar The heart of Brutus yearns to think uponA street near the CapitolArtemidorus reading paperCaesar beware of Brutus take heed of Cassius come not near Casca have an eye to Cinna trust not Trebonius mark well Metellus Cimber Decius Brutus loves thee not thou hast wronged Caius Ligarius There is but one mind in all these men and it is bent against Caesar If thou beest not immortal look about you Security gives way to conspiracy The mighty gods defend thee Thy lover Artemidorus Here will I stand till Caesar pass along And as a suitor will I give him this My heart laments that virtue cannot live Out of the teeth of emulation If thou read this O Caesar thou mayest live If not the Fates with traitors do contrive Another part of the same street before the house of BrutusPortia and LuciusI prithee boy run to the Senate House Stay not to answer me but get thee gone Why dost thou stayTo know my errand madamI would have had thee there and here again Ere I can tell thee what thou shouldst do there O constancy be strong upon my side Set a huge mountain 'tween my heart and tongue

Caesar To be so good to Caesar as to hear me I shall beseech him to befriend himselfWhy know'st thou any harm's intended towards himNone that I know will be much that I fear may chance Good morrow to you Here the street is narrow The throng that follows Caesar at the heels Of senators of praetors common suitors Will crowd a feeble man almost to death I'll get me to a place more void and there Speak to great Caesar as he comes along I must go in Ay me how weak a thing The heart of woman is O Brutus The heavens speed thee in thine prise Sure the boy heard me Brutus hath a suit That Caesar will not grant O I grow faint Run Lucius and commend me to my lord Say I am merry Come to me again And bring me word what he doth say to thee severally
