soul abhors Thyself hast lov'd and I have heard thee say No grief did ever come so near thy heart As when thy lady and thy true love died Upon whose grave thou vow'dst pure chastity Sir Eglamour I would to Valentine To Mantua where I hear he makes abode And for the ways are dangerous to pass I do desire thy worthy company Upon whose faith and honour I repose Urge not my father's anger Eglamour But think upon my grief a lady's grief And on the justice of my flying hence To keep me from a most unholy match Which heaven and fortune still rewards with plagues I do desire thee even from a heart As full of sorrows as the sea of sands To bear me company and go with me If not to hide what I have said to thee That I may venture to depart aloneMadam I pity much your grievances Which since I know

with him look you it goes hard one that I brought up of a puppy one that I sav'd from drowning when three or four of his blind brothers and sisters went to it I have taught him even as one would say precisely 'Thus I would teach a dog' I was sent to deliver him as a present to Mistress Silvia from my master and I came no sooner into the diningchamber but he steps me to her trencher and steals her capon's leg O 'tis a foul thing when a cur cannot keep himself in all companies I would have as one should say one that takes upon him to be a dog indeed to be as it were a dog at all things If I had not had more wit than he to take a fault upon me that he did I think verily he had been hang'd for't sure as I live he had suffer'd for't You shall judge He thrusts me himself into the company of three or four gentlemanlike dogs under the Duke's table he had not been there bless the mark a pissing while but all the chamber smelt him 'Out with the dog' says one 'What cur is that' says another 'Whip him out' says the third 'Hang him up' says the Duke I having been acquainted with the smell before knew it was Crab and goes me to the fellow that whips the dogs 'Friend' quoth I 'you mean to whip the dog' 'Ay marry do I' quoth he 'You do him the more wrong' quoth I twas I did the thing you wot of' He makes me no more ado but whips me out of the chamber How many masters would do this for his servant Nay I'll be sworn I have sat in the stock for puddings he hath stol'n otherwise he had been executed I have stood on the pillory for geese he hath kill'd otherwise he had suffer'd for't Thou think'st not of this now Nay I remember the trick you serv'd me when I took my leave of Madam Silvia Did not I bid thee still mark me and do as I do When didst thou see me heave up my leg and make water against a gentlewoman's farthingale Didst thou ever see me do such a trickand in boy's clothesSebastian is thy name I like thee well And will employ thee in some service presentlyIn what

thou offer her this from meAy sir the other squirrel was stol'n from me by the hangman's boys in the marketplace and then I offer'd her mine own who is a dog as big as ten of yours and therefore the gift the greaterGo get thee hence and find my dog again Or ne'er return again into my sight Away I say Stayest thou to vex me hereA slave that still an end turns me to shame Sebastian I have tained thee Partly that I have need of such a youth That can with some discretion do my business For 'tis no trusting to yond foolish lout But chiefly for thy face and thy behaviour Which if my augury deceive me not Witness good bringing up fortune and truth Therefore know thou for this I tain thee Go presently and take this ring with thee Deliver it to Madam Silvia She lov'd me well deliver'd it to meIt seems you lov'd not her to leave her token She is dead belikeNot so I think she livesAlasWhy dost thou cry 'Alas'I cannot choose But pity herWherefore shouldst thou pity herBecause methinks that she lov'd you as well As you do love your lady Silvia She dreams on him that has forgot her love You dote on her that cares not for your love 'Tis pity love should be so contrary And thinking on it makes me cry 'Alas'Well give her that ring and therewithal This letter That's her chamber Tell my lady I claim the promise for her heavenly picture Your message done hie home unto my chamber Where thou shalt find me sad and solitary How many women would do such a message Alas poor Proteus thou hast tain'd A fox to be the shepherd of thy lambs Alas poor fool why do I pity him That with his very heart despiseth me Because he loves her he despiseth me Because I love him I must pity him This ring I gave him when he parted from me To bind him to remember my good will And now am I unhappy messenger To plead for that which I would not obtain To carry that which I would have refus'd To praise his faith which I would have disprais'd I am my master's true confirmed love But cannot be true servant to my master Unless I prove false traitor to myself Yet will I woo for him but yet so coldly As heaven it knows I would not have him speedattended Gentlewoman good day I pray you be my mean To bring me where to speak with Madam SilviaWhat would you with her if that I be sheIf you be she I do entreat your patience To hear me speak the message I am sent onFrom whomFrom my master Sir Proteus madamO he sends you for a pictureAy madamUrsula bring my picture there Go give your master this Tell him from me One Julia that his changing thoughts forget Would better fit his chamber than this shadowMadam please you peruse this letter Pardon me madam I have unadvis'd Deliver'd you a paper that I should not This is the letter to your ladyshipI pray thee let me look on that againIt may not be good madam pardon meThere hold I will not look upon your master's lines I know they are stuff'd with protestations And full of newfound oaths which he wul break As easily as I do tear his paperMadam he sends your ladyship this ringThe more shame for him that he sends it me For I have heard him say a thousand times His Julia gave it him at his departure Though his false finger have profan'd the ring Mine shall not do his Julia so much wrongShe thanks youWhat say'st thouI thank you madam that you tender her Poor gentlewoman my master wrongs her muchDost thou know herAlmost as well as I do know myself To think upon her woes I do protest That I have wept a hundred several timesBelike she thinks that Proteus hath forsook herI think she doth and that's her cause of sorrowIs she not passing fairShe hath been fairer madam than she is When she did think my master lov'd her well She in my judgment was as fair as you But since she did neglect her lookingglass And threw her sunexpelling mask away The air hath starv'd the roses in her cheeks And pinch'd the lilytincture of her face That now she is become as black as How tall was sheAbout my stature for at Pentecost When all our pageants of delight were play'd Our youth got me to play the woman's part And I was trimm'd in Madam Julia's gown Which served me as fit by all men's judgments As if the garment had been made for me Therefore I know she is about my height And at that time I made her weep a good For I did play a lamentable part Madam 'twas Ariadne passioning For Theseus' perjury and unjust flight Which I so lively acted with my tears That my poor mistress moved therewithal Wept bitterly and would I might be dead If I in thought felt not her very sorrowShe is beholding to thee gentle youth Alas poor lady desolate and left I weep myself to think upon thy words Here youth there is my purse I give thee this For thy sweet mistress' sake because thou lov'st her Farewell with And she shall thank you for't if e'er you know her A virtuous gentlewoman mild and beautiful I hope my master's suit will be but cold Since she respects my mistress' love so much Alas how love can trifle with itself Here is her picture let me see I think If I had such a tire this face of mine Were full as lovely as is this of hers And yet the painter flatter'd her a little Unless I flatter with myself too much Her hair is auburn mine is perfect yellow If that be all the difference in his love I'll get me such a colour'd periwig Her eyes are grey as glass and so are mine Ay but her forehead's low and mine's as high What should it be that he respects in her But I can make respective in myself If this fond Love were not a blinded god Come shadow come and take this shadow up For 'tis thy rival O thou senseless form Thou shalt be worshipp'd kiss'd lov'd and ador'd And were there sense in his idolatry My substance should be statue in thy stead I'll use thee kindly for thy mistress' sake That us'd me so or else by Jove I vow I should have scratch'd out your unseeing eyes To make my master out of love with thee
