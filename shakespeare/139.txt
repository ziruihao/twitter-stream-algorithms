Athens The palace of and 'Tis strange my Theseus that these lovers speak ofMore strange than true I never may believe These antique fables nor these fairy toys Lovers and madmen have such seething brains Such shaping fantasies that apprehend More than cool reason ever comprehends The lunatic the lover and the poet Are of imagination all compact One sees more devils than vast hell can hold That is the madman The lover all as frantic Sees Helen's beauty in a brow of Egypt The poet's eye in a fine frenzy rolling Doth glance from heaven to earth from earth to heaven And as imagination bodies forth The forms of things unknown the poet's pen Turns them to shapes and gives to airy nothing A local habitation and a name Such tricks hath strong imagination That if it would but apprehend some joy It comprehends some bringer of that joy Or in the night imagining some fear How easy is a bush suppos'd a bearBut all the story of the night told over And all their minds transfigur'd so together More witnesseth than fancy's images And grows to something of great constancy But howsoever strange and admirable and Here come the lovers full of joy and mirth Joy gentle friends joy and fresh days of love Accompany your heartsMore than to us Wait in your royal walks your board your bedCome now what masques what dances shall we have To wear away this long age of three hours Between our aftersupper and bedtime Where is our usual manager of mirth What revels are in hand Is there no play To ease the anguish of a torturing hour Call PhilostrateHere mighty TheseusSay what abridgment have you for this evening What masque what music How shall we beguile The lazy time if not with some delightThere is a brief how many sports are ripe Make choice of which your Highness will see first Giving a paper'The battle with the Centaurs to be sung By an Athenian eunuch to the harp' We'll none of that that have I told my love In glory of my kinsman Hercules 'The riot of the tipsy Bacchanals Tearing the Thracian singer in their rage' That is an old device and it was play'd When I from Thebes came last a conqueror 'The thrice three Muses mourning for the death Of Learning late deceas'd in beggary' That is some satire keen and critical Not sorting with a nuptial ceremony 'A tedious brief scene of young Pyramus And his love Thisby very tragical mirth' Merry and tragical tedious and brief That is hot ice and wondrous strange snow How shall we find the concord of this discordA play there is my lord some ten words long Which is as brief as I have known a play But by ten words my lord it is too long Which makes it tedious for in all the play There is not one word apt one player fitted And tragical my noble lord it is For Pyramus therein doth kill himself Which when I saw rehears'd I must confess Made mine eyes water but more merry tears The passion of loud laughter never shedWhat are they that do play itHardhanded men that work in Athens here Which never labour'd in their minds till now And now have toil'd their unbreathed memories With this same play against your nuptialAnd we will hear itNo my noble lord It is not for you I have heard it over And it is nothing nothing in the world Unless you can find sport in their intents Extremely stretch'd and conn'd with cruel pain To do you serviceI will hear that play For never anything can be amiss When simpleness and duty tender it Go bring them in and take your places ladiesI love not to see wretchedness o'ercharged And duty in his service perishingWhy gentle sweet you shall see no such thingHe says they can do nothing in this kindThe kinder we to give them thanks for nothing Our sport shall be to take what they mistake And what poor duty cannot do noble respect Takes it in might not merit Where I have come great clerks have purposed To greet me with premeditated welcomes Where I have seen them shiver and look pale Make periods in the midst of sentences Throttle their practis'd accent in their fears And in conclusion dumbly have broke off Not paying me a welcome Trust me sweet Out of this silence yet I pick'd a welcome And in the modesty of fearful duty I read as much as from the rattling tongue Of saucy and audacious eloquence Love therefore and tonguetied simplicity In least speak most to my capacityReplease your Grace the Prologue is address'dLet him approachFlourish of trumpets as the If we offend it is with our good will That you should think we come not to offend But with good will To show our simple skill That is the true beginning of our end Consider then we come but in despite We do not come as minding to content you Our true intent is All for your delight We are not here That you should here repent you The actors are at band and by their show You shall know all that you are like to knowThis fellow doth not stand upon pointsHe hath rid his prologue like a rough colt he knows not the stop A good moral my lord it is not enough to speak but to speak trueIndeed he hath play'd on this prologue like a child on a recorder a sound but not in governmentHis speech was like a tangled chain nothing im paired but all disordered Who is nextwith a trumpet before them as in dumb show andand Gentles perchance you wonder at this show But wonder on till truth make all things plain This man is Pyramus if you would know This beauteous lady Thisby is certain This man with lime and roughcast doth present Wall that vile Wall which did these lovers sunder And through Walls chink poor souls they are content To whisper At the which let no man wonder This man with lanthorn dog and bush of thorn Presenteth Moonshine for if you will know By moonshine did these lovers think no scorn To meet at Ninus' tomb there there to woo This grisly beast which Lion hight by name The trusty Thisby coming first by night Did scare away or rather did affright And as she fled her mantle she did fall Which Lion vile with bloody mouth did stain Anon comes Pyramus sweet youth and tall And finds his trusty Thisby's mantle slain Whereat with blade with bloody blameful blade He bravely broach'd his boiling bloody breast And Thisby tarrying in mulberry shade His dagger drew and died For all the rest Let Lion Moonshine Wall and lovers twain At large discourse while here they do remainand I wonder if the lion be to speakNo wonder my lord one lion may when many asses doIn this same interlude it doth befall That I one Snout by name present a wall And such a wall as I would have you think That had in it a crannied hole or chink Through which the lovers Pyramus and Thisby Did whisper often very secretly This loam this roughcast and this stone doth show That I am that same wall the truth is so And this the cranny is right and sinister Through which the fearful lovers are to whisperWould you desire lime and hair to speak betterIt is the wittiest partition that ever I heard discourse my lord Pyramus draws near the wall silenceO grimlook'd night O night with hue so black O night which ever art when day is not O night O night alack alack alack I fear my Thisby's promise is forgot And thou O wall O sweet O lovely wall That stand'st between her father's ground and mine Thou wall O wall O sweet and lovely wall Show me thy chink to blink through with mine eyneholds up his fingers Thanks courteous wall Jove shield thee well for this But what see what see I No Thisby do I see O wicked wall through whom I see no bliss Curs'd he thy stones for thus deceiving meThe wall methinks being sensible should curse againNo in truth sir he should not Deceiving me is Thisby's cue She is tonow and I am to spy her through the wall You shall see it will fall pat as I told you yonder she comesO wall full often hast thou beard my moans For parting my fair Pyramus and me My cherry lips have often kiss'd thy stones Thy stones with lime and hair knit up in theeI see a voice now will I to the chink To spy an I can hear my Thisby's face ThisbyMy love thou art my love I thinkThink what thou wilt I am thy lover's grace And like Limander am I trusty stillAnd I like Helen till the Fates me killNot Shafalus to Procrus was so trueAs Shafalus to Procrus I to youO kiss me through the hole of this vile wallI kiss the wall's hole not your lips at allWilt thou at Ninny's tomb meet me straightwayTide life tide death I come without delay Thus have I Wall my part discharged so And being done thus Wall away doth goNow is the moon used between the two neighboursNo remedy my lord when walls are so wilful to hear without warningThis is the silliest stuff that ever I heardThe best in this kind are but shadows and the worst are no worse if imagination amend themIt must be your imagination then and not theirsIf we imagine no worse of them than they of themselves they may pass for excellent men Here come two noble beasts in a man and a lion and You ladies you whose gentle hearts do fear The smallest monstrous mouse that creeps on floor May now perchance both quake and tremble here When lion rough in wildest rage doth roar Then know that I as Snug the joiner am A lion fell nor else no lion's dam For if I should as lion come in strife Into this place 'twere pity on my lifeA very gentle beast and of a good conscienceThe very best at a beast my lord that e'er I sawThis lion is a very fox for his valourTrue and a goose for his discretionNot so my lord for his valour cannot carry his discretion and the fox carries the gooseHis discretion I am sure cannot carry his valour for the goose carries not the fox It is well Leave it to his discretion and let us listen to the MoonThis lanthorn doth the horned moon presentHe should have worn the horns on his headHe is no crescent and his horns are invisible within the circumferenceThis lanthorn doth the horned moon present Myself the Man i' th' Moon do seem to beThis is the greatest error of all the rest the man should be put into the lantern How is it else the man i' th' moonHe dares not come there for the candle for you see it is already in snuffI am aweary of this moon Would he would changeIt appears by his small light of discretion that he is in the wane but yet in courtesy in all reason we must stay the timeProceed MoonAll that I have to say is to tell you that the lanthorn is the moon I the Man i' th' Moon this thornbush my thornbush and this dog my dogWhy all these should be in the lantern for all these are in the moon But silence here comes Thisby Re This is old Ninny's tomb Where is my loveRoaring O runs offWell roar'd LionWell run ThisbyWell shone Moon Truly the moon shines with a good graceThe tearsMantle and Well mous'd Lion Re And then came PyramusAnd so the lion vanish'dSweet Moon I thank thee for thy sunny beams I thank thee Moon for shining now so bright For by thy gracious golden glittering gleams I trust to take of truest Thisby sightBut stay O spiteBut mark poor knightWhat dreadful dole is hereEyes do you seeHow can it heO dainty duck O dearThy mantle goodWhat stain'd with bloodApproach ye Furies fellO Fates come comeCut thread and thrumQuail crush conclude and quellThis passion and the death of a dear friend would go near to make a man look sadBeshrew my heart but I pity the manO wherefore Nature didst thou lions frame Since lion vile hath here deflower'd my dear Which is no no which was the fairest dame That liv'd that lov'd that lik'd that look'd with cheerCome tears confoundOut sword and woundThe pap of PyramusAy that left papWhere heart doth hop Stabs himselfThus die I thus thus thusNow am I deadNow am I fledMy soul is in the skyTongue lose thy lightMoon take thy flightNow die die die die die DiesNo die but an ace for him for he is but oneLess than an ace man for he is dead he is nothingWith the help of a surgeon he might yet recover and yet prove an assHow chance Moonshine is gone before Thisby comes back and finds her loverRe She will find him by starlight Here she comes and her passion ends the playMethinks she should not use a long one for such a Pyramus I hope she will be briefA mote will turn the balance which Pyramus which Thisby is the better he for a man God warrant us She for a woman God bless usShe hath spied him already with those sweet eyesAnd thus she moans videlicet Asleep my loveWhat dead my doveO Pyramus ariseSpeak speak Quite dumbDead dead A tombMust cover thy sweet eyesThese lily lipsThis cherry noseThese yellow cowslip cheeksAre gone are goneLovers make moanHis eyes were green as leeksO Sisters ThreeCome come to meWith hands as pale as milkLay them in goreSince you have shoreWith shears his thread of silkTongue not a wordCome trusty swordCome blade my breast imbrueStabs herselfAnd farewell friendsThus Thisby endsAdieu adieu adieu DiesMoonshine and Lion are left to bury the deadAy and Wall tooStarting up No I assure you the wall is down that parted their fathers Will it please you to see the Epilogue or to hear a Bergomask dance between two of our companyNo epilogue I pray you for your play needs no excuse Never excuse for when the players are all dead there need none to be blamed Marry if he that writ it had played Pyramus and hang'd himself in Thisby's garter it would have been a fine tragedy And so it is truly and very notably discharg'd But come your Bergomask let your epilogue alone A dance The iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve Lovers to bed 'tis almost fairy time I fear we shall outsleep the coming morn As much as we this night have overwatch'd This palpablegross play hath well beguil'd The heavy gait of night Sweet friends to bed A fortnight hold we this solemnity In nightly revels and new jollity with a broom Now the hungry lion roarsAnd the wolf behowls the moonWhilst the heavy ploughman snoresAll with weary task fordoneNow the wasted brands do glowWhilst the screechowl screeching loudPuts the wretch that lies in woeIn remembrance of a shroudNow it is the time of nightThat the graves all gaping wideEvery one lets forth his spriteIn the churchway paths to glideAnd we fairies that do runBy the triple Hecate's teamFrom the presence of the sunFollowing darkness like a dreamNow are frolic Not a mouseShall disturb this hallowed houseI am sent with broom beforeTo sweep the dust behind the door andwith all their train Through the house give glimmering lightBy the dead and drowsy fireEvery elf and fairy spriteHop as light as bird from brierAnd this ditty after meSing and dance it trippingly First rehearse your song by rote To each word a warbling note Hand in hand with fairy grace Will we sing and bless this placeleading the sing and dance Now until the break of dayThrough this house each fairy strayTo the best bridebed will weWhich by us shall blessed beAnd the issue there createEver shall be fortunateSo shall all the couples threeEver true in loving beAnd the blots of Nature's handShall not in their issue standNever mole harelip nor scarNor mark prodigious such as areDespised in nativityShall upon their children beWith this fielddew consecrateEvery fairy take his gaitAnd each several chamber blessThrough this palace with sweet peaceAnd the owner of it blestEver shall in safety restTrip away make no stayMeet me all by break of day all butIf we shadows have offendedThink but this and all is mendedThat you have but slumb'red hereWhile these visions did appearAnd this weak and idle themeNo more yielding but a dreamGentles do not reprehendIf you pardon we will mendAnd as I am an honest PuckIf we have unearned luckNow to scape the serpent's tongueWe will make amends ere longElse the Puck a liar callSo good night unto you allGive me your hands if we be friendsAnd Robin shall restore amends
