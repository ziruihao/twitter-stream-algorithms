WarwickWho should that be Belike unlook'd for friendsThey are at hand and you shall quickly know March Flourish and soldiersGo trumpet to the walls and sound a parleSee how the surly Warwick mans the wallO unbid spite Is sportful Edward come Where slept our scouts or how are they seduc'd That we could hear no news of his repairNow Warwick wilt thou ope the city gates Speak gentle words and humbly bend thy knee Call Edward King and at his hands beg mercy And he shall pardon thee these outragesNay rather wilt thou draw thy forces hence Confess who set thee up and pluck'd thee down Call Warwick patron and be penitent And thou shalt still remain the Duke of YorkI thought at least he would have said the King Or did he make the jest against his willIs not a dukedom sir a goodly giftAy by my faith for a poor earl to give I'll do thee service for so good a gift'Twas I that gave the kingdom to thy brotherWhy then 'tis mine if but by Warwick's giftThou art no Atlas for so great a weight And weakling Warwick takes his gift again And Henry is my King Warwick his subjectBut Warwick's king is Edward's prisoner And gallant Warwick do but answer this What is the body when the head is offAlas that Warwick had no more forecast But whiles he thought to steal the single ten The king was slily finger'd from the deck You left poor Henry at the Bishop's palace And ten to one you'll meet him in the Tower'Tis even so yet you are Warwick stillCome Warwick take the time kneel down kneel down Nay when Strike now or else the iron coolsI had rather chop this hand off at a blow And with the other fling it at thy face Than bear so low a sail to strike to theeSail how thou canst have wind and tide thy friend This hand fast wound about thy coalblack hair Shall whiles thy head is warm and new cut off Write in the dust this sentence with thy blood 'Windchanging Warwick now can change no more'with drum and coloursO cheerful colours See where Oxford comesOxford Oxford for Lancaster He and his forcesthe cityThe gates are open let ustooSo other foes may set upon our backs Stand we in good array for they no doubt Will issue out again and bid us battle If not the city being but of small defence We'll quietly rouse the traitors in the sameO welcome Oxford for we want thy helpwith drum and coloursMontague Montague for Lancaster He and his forcesthe cityThou and thy brother both shall buy this treason Even with the dearest blood your bodies bearThe harder match'd the greater victory My mind presageth happy gain and conquestwith drum and coloursSomerset Somerset for Lancaster He and his forcesthe cityTwo of thy name both Dukes of Somerset Have sold their lives unto the house of York And thou shalt be the third if this sword holdwith drum and coloursAnd lo where George of Clarence sweeps along Of force enough to bid his brother battle With whom an upright zeal to right prevails More than the nature of a brother's loveClarence Clarence for LancasterEt tu Brute wilt thou stab Caesar too A parley sirrah to George of Clarence Sound a parley and whisperCome Clarence come Thou wilt if Warwick callTaking the red rose from his hat and throwing it atFather of Warwick know you what this means Look here I throw my infamy at thee I will not ruinate my father's house Who gave his blood to lime the stones together And set up Lancaster Why trowest thou Warwick That Clarence is so harsh so blunt unnatural To bend the fatal instruments of war Against his brother and his lawful King Perhaps thou wilt object my holy oath To keep that oath were more impiety Than Jephtha when he sacrific'd his daughter I am so sorry for my trespass made That to deserve well at my brother's hands I here proclaim myself thy mortal foe With resolution whereso'er I meet thee As I will meet thee if thou stir abroad To plague thee for thy foul misleading me And so proudhearted Warwick I defy thee And to my brother turn my blushing cheeks Pardon me Edward I will make amends And Richard do not frown upon my faults For I will henceforth be no more unconstantNow welcome more and ten times more belov'd Than if thou never hadst deserv'd our hateWelcome good Clarence this is brotherlikeO passing traitor perjur'd and unjustWhat Warwick wilt thou leave die town and fight Or shall we beat the stones about thine earsAlas I am not coop'd here for defence I will away towards Barnet presently And bid thee battle Edward if thou dar'stYes Warwick Edward dares and leads the way Lords to the field Saint George and victory March and his company followA field of battle near Barnet Alarum and excursions bringing forthwoundedSo lie thou there Die thou and die our fear For Warwick was a bug that fear'd us all Now Montague sit fast I seek for thee That Warwick's bones may keep thine companyAh who is nigh Come to me friend or foe And tell me who is victor York or Warwick Why ask I that My mangled body shows My blood my want of strength my sick heart shows That I must yield my body to the earth And by my fall the conquest to my foe Thus yields the cedar to the axe's edge Whose arms gave shelter to the princely eagle Under whose shade the ramping lion slept Whose topbranch overpeer'd Jove's spreading tree And kept low shrubs from winter's pow'rful wind These eyes that now are dimm'd with death's black veil Have been as piercing as the midday sun To search the secret treasons of the world The wrinkles in my brows now fill'd with blood Were lik'ned oft to kingly sepulchres For who liv'd King but I could dig his grave And who durst smile when Warwick bent his brow Lo now my glory smear'd in dust and blood My parks my walks my manors that I had Even now forsake me and of all my lands Is nothing left me but my body's length what is pomp rule reign but earth and dust And live we how we can yet die we mustand Ah Warwick Warwick wert thou as we are We might recover all our loss again The Queen from France hath brought a puissant power Even now we heard the news Ah couldst thou flyWhy then I would not fly Ah Montague If thou be there sweet brother take my hand And with thy lips keep in my soul a while Thou lov'st me not for brother if thou didst Thy tears would wash this cold congealed blood That glues my lips and will not let me speak Come quickly Montague or I am deadAh Warwick Montague hath breath'd his last And to the latest gasp cried out for Warwick And said 'Commend me to my valiant brother' And more he would have said and more he spoke Which sounded like a clamour in a vault That mought not be distinguish'd but at last I well might hear delivered with a groan 'O farewell Warwick'Sweet rest his soul Fly lords and save yourselves For Warwick bids you all farewell to meet in heaven DiesAway away to meet the Queen's great power Here they bear away his bodyAnother part of the field Flourishin triumph with and the restThus far our fortune keeps an upward course And we are grac'd with wreaths of victory But in the midst of this brightshining day I spy a black suspicious threat'ning cloud That will encounter with our glorious sun Ere he attain his easeful western bed I mean my lords those powers that the Queen Hath rais'd in Gallia have arriv'd our coast And as we hear march on to fight with usA little gale will soon disperse that cloud And blow it to the source from whence it came Thy very beams will dry those vapours up For every cloud engenders not a stormThe Queen is valued thirty thousand strong And Somerset with Oxford fled to her If she have time to breathe be well assur'd Her faction will be full as strong as oursare advertis'd by our loving friends That they do hold their course toward Tewksbury We having now the best at Barnet field Will thither straight for willingness rids way And as we march our strength will be augmented In every county as we go along Strike up the drum cry 'Courage' and awayPlains wear Tewksbury Flourish Marchand Great lords wise men ne'er sit and wail their loss But cheerly seek how to redress their harms What though the mast be now blown overboard The cable broke the holdinganchor lost And half our sailors swallow'd in the flood Yet lives our pilot still Is't meet that he Should leave the helm and like a fearful lad With tearful eyes add water to the sea And give more strength to that which hath too much Whiles in his moan the ship splits on the rock Which industry and courage might have sav'd Ah what a shame ah what a fault were this Say Warwick was our anchor what of that And Montague our topmast what of him Our slaught'red friends the tackles what of these Why is not Oxford here another anchor And Somerset another goodly mast The friends of France our shrouds and tacklings And though unskilful why not Ned and I For once allow'd the skilful pilot's charge We will not from the helm to sit and weep But keep our course though the rough wind say no From shelves and rocks that threaten us with wreck As good to chide the waves as speak them fair And what is Edward but a ruthless sea What Clarence but a quicksand of deceit And Richard but a ragged fatal rock All these the enemies to our poor bark Say you can swim alas 'tis but a while Tread on the sand why there you quickly sink Bestride the rock the tide will wash you off Or else you famish that's a threefold death This speak I lords to let you understand If case some one of you would fly from us That there's no hop'dfor mercy with the brothers More than with ruthless waves with sands and rocks Why courage then What cannot be avoided 'Twere childish weakness to lament or fear Methinks a woman of this valiant spirit Should if a coward hear her speak these words Infuse his breast with magnanimity And make him naked foil a manatarms I speak not this as doubting any here For did I but suspect a fearful man He should have leave to go away betimes Lest in our need he might infect another And make him of the like spirit to himself If any such be here as God forbid Let him depart before we need his helpWomen and children of so high a courage And warriors faint Why 'twere perpetual shame O brave young Prince thy famous grandfather Doth live again in thee Long mayst thou Eve To bear his image and renew his gloriesAnd he that will not fight for such a hope Go home to bed and like the owl by day If he arise be mock'd and wond'red atThanks gentle Somerset sweet Oxford thanks And take his thanks that yet hath nothing elsea Prepare you lords for Edward is at hand Ready to fight therefore be resoluteI thought no less It is his policy To haste thus fast to find us unprovidedBut he's deceiv'd we are in readinessThis cheers my heart to see your forwardnessHere pitch our battle hence we will not budge Flourish and marchat a distance and soldiersBrave followers

out Give signal to the fight and to it lordsLords knights and gentlemen what I should say My tears gainsay for every word I speak Ye see I drink the water of my eye Therefore no more but this Henry your sovereign Is prisoner to the foe his state usurp'd His realm a slaughterhouse his subjects slain His statutes cancell'd and his treasure spent And yonder is the wolf that makes this spoil You fight in justice Then in God's name lords Be valiant and give signal to the fightAlarum retreat excursions Another part of the field Flourish and forces With andprisonersNow here a period of tumultuous broils Away with Oxford to Hames Castle straight For Somerset off with his guilty head Go bear them hence I will not hear them speakFor my part I'll not trouble thee with wordsNor I but stoop with patience to my fortuneguardedSo part we sadly in this troublous world To meet with joy in sweet JerusalemIs proclamation made that who finds Edward Shall have a high reward and he his lifeIt is and lo where youthful Edward comessoldiers with Bring forth the gallant let us hear him speak What can so young a man begin to prick Edward what satisfaction canst thou make For bearing arms for stirring up my subjects And all the trouble thou hast turn'd me to Speak like a subject proud ambitious York Suppose that I am now my father's mouth Resign thy chair and where I stand kneel thou Whilst I propose the selfsame words to the Which traitor thou wouldst have me answer toAh that thy father had been so resolv'dThat you might still have worn the petticoat And ne'er have stol'n the breech from Lancaster Let Aesop fable in a winter's night His currish riddle sorts not with this placeBy heaven brat I'll plague ye for that wordAy thou wast born to be a plague to menFor God's sake take away this captive scold Nay take away this scolding crookback ratherPeace wilful boy or I will charm your tongueUntutor'd lad thou art too malapert I know my duty you are all undutiful Lascivious Edward and thou perjur'd George And thou misshapen Dick I tell ye all I am your better traitors as ye are And thou usurp'st my father's right and mineTake that the likeness of this railer hereStabs himSprawl'st thou Take that to end thy agonyStabs himAnd there's for twitting me with perjuryStabs himO kill me tooMarry and shall Offers to kill herHold Richard hold for we have done to muchWhy should she live to fill the world with wordsWhat doth she swoon Use means for her recoveryClarence excuse me to the King my brother I'll hence to London on a serious matter Ere ye come there be sure to hear some newsWhat whatThe Tower the Tower O Ned sweet Ned speak to thy mother boy Canst thou not speak O traitors murderers They that stabb'd Caesar shed no blood at all Did not offend nor were not worthy blame If this foul deed were by to equal it He was a man this in respect a child And men ne'er spend their fury on a child What's worse than murderer that I may name it No no my heart will burst an if I speak And I will speak that so my heart may burst Butchers and villains bloody cannibals How sweet a plant have you untimely cropp'd You have no children butchers if you had The thought of them would have stirr'd up remorse But if you ever chance to have a child Look in his youth to have him so cut off As deathsmen you have rid this sweet young princeAway with her go bear her hence perforceNay never bear me hence dispatch me here Here sheathe thy sword I'll pardon thee my death What wilt thou not Then Clarence do it thouBy heaven I will not do thee so much easeGood Clarence do sweet Clarence do thou do itDidst thou not hear me swear I would not do itAy but thou usest to forswear thyself 'Twas sin before but now 'tis charity What wilt thou not Where is that devil's butcher Hardfavour'd Richard Richard where art thou Thou art not here Murder is thy almsdeed Petitioners for blood thou ne'er put'st backAway I say I charge ye bear her henceSo come to you and yours as to this princeled out forciblyWhere's Richard goneTo London all in post and as I guess To make a bloody supper in the TowerHe's sudden if a thing comes in his head Now march we hence Discharge the common sort With pay and thanks and let's away to London And see our gentle queen how well she fares By this I hope she hath a son for me London The Towerand with theon the wallsGood day my lord What at your book so hardAy my good lord my lord I should say rather 'Tis sin to flatter 'good' was little better 'Good Gloucester' and 'good devil' were alike And both preposterous therefore not 'good lord'Sirrah leave us to ourselves we must confer So flies the reckless shepherd from the wolf So first the harmless sheep doth yield his fleece And next his throat unto the butcher's knife What scene of death hath Roscius now to actSuspicion always haunts the guilty mind The thief doth fear each bush an officerThe bird that hath been limed in a bush With trembling wings misdoubteth every bush And I the hapless male to one sweet bird Have now the fatal object in my eye Where my poor young was lim'd was caught and kill'dWhy what a peevish fool was that of Crete That taught his son the office of a fowl And yet for all his wings the fool was drown'dI Daedalus my poor boy Icarus Thy father Minos that denied our course The sun that sear'd the wings of my sweet boy Thy brother Edward and thyself the sea Whose envious gulf did swallow up his life Ah kill me with thy weapon not with words My breast can better brook thy dagger's point Than can my ears that tragic history But wherefore dost thou come Is't for my lifeThink'st thou I am an executionerA persecutor I am sure thou art If murdering innocents be executing Why then thou are an executionerThy son I kill'd for his presumptionHadst thou been kill'd when first thou didst presume Thou hadst not liv'd to kill a son of mine And thus I prophesy that many a thousand Which now mistrust no parcel of my fear And many an old man's sigh and many a widow's And many an orphan's waterstanding eye Men for their sons wives for their husbands Orphans for their parents' timeless death Shall rue the hour that ever thou wast born The owl shriek'd at thy birth an evil sign The nightcrow cried aboding luckless time Dogs howl'd and hideous tempest shook down trees The raven rook'd her on the chimney's top And chatt'ring pies in dismal discords sung Thy mother felt more than a mother's pain And yet brought forth less than a mother's hope To wit an indigest deformed lump Not like the fruit of such a goodly tree Teeth hadst thou in thy head when thou wast born To signify thou cam'st to bite the world And if the rest be true which I have heard Thou cam'stI'll hear no more Die prophet in thy speechStabs him For this amongst the rest was I ordain'dAy and for much more slaughter after this O God forgive my sins and pardon thee DiesWhat will the aspiring blood of Lancaster Sink in the ground I thought it would have mounted See how my sword weeps for the poor King's death O may such purple tears be always shed From those that wish the downfall of our house If any spark of life be yet remaining Down down to hell and say I sent thee thitherStabs him again I that have neither pity love nor fear Indeed 'tis true that Henry told me of For I have often heard my mother say I came into the world with my legs forward Had I not reason think ye to make haste And seek their ruin that usurp'd our right The midwife wonder'd and the women cried 'O Jesus bless us he is born with teeth' And so I was which plainly signified That I should snarl and bite and play the dog Then since the heavens have shap'd my body so Let hell make crook'd my mind to answer it I have no brother I am like no brother And this word 'love' which greybeards call divine Be resident in men like one another And not in me I am myself alone Clarence beware thou keep'st me from the light But I will sort a pitchy day for thee For I will buzz abroad such prophecies That Edward shall be fearful of his life And then to purge his fear I'll be thy death King Henry and the Prince his son are gone Clarence thy turn is next and then the rest Counting myself but bad till I be best I'll throw thy body in another room And triumph Henry in thy day of doomwith the bodyLondon The palace Flourishwith the Youngand attendantsOnce more we sit in England's royal throne Repurchas'd with the blood of enemies What valiant foemen like to autumn's corn Have we mow'd down in tops of all their pride Three Dukes of Somerset threefold renown'd For hardy and undoubted champions Two Cliffords as the father and the son And two Northumberlands two braver men Ne'er spurr'd their coursers at the trumpet's sound With them the two brave bears Warwick and Montague That in their chains fetter'd the kingly lion And made the forest tremble when they roar'd Thus have we swept suspicion from our seat And made our footstool of security Come hither Bess and let me kiss my boy Young Ned for thee thine uncles and myself Have in our armours watch'd the winter's night Went all afoot in summer's scalding heat That thou might'st repossess the crown in peace And of our labours thou shalt reap the gainAside I'll blast his harvest if your head were laid For yet I am not look'd on in the world This shoulder was ordain'd so thick to heave And heave it shall some weight or break my back Work thou the way and that shall executeClarence and Gloucester love my lovely queen And kiss your princely nephew brothers bothThe duty that I owe unto your Majesty I seal upon the lips of this sweet babeThanks noble Clarence worthy brother thanksAnd that I love the tree from whence thou sprang'st Witness the loving kiss I give the fruit Aside To say the truth so Judas kiss'd his master And cried 'All hail' when as he meant all harmNow am I seated as my soul delights Having my country's peace and brothers' lovesWhat will your Grace have done with Margaret Reignier her father to the King of France Hath pawn'd the Sicils and Jerusalem And hither have they sent it for her ransomAway with her and waft her hence to France And now what rests but that we spend the time With stately triumphs mirthful comic shows Such as befits the pleasure of the court Sound drums and trumpets Farewell sour annoy For here I hope begins our lasting joy
