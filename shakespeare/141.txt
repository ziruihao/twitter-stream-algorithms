MessinaSceneAn orchard before Leonato's houseLeonato Governor of Messina Hero his Daughter and Beatrice his Niece with a Messenger Leon I learn in this letter that Don Pedro of Arragon comes this night to Messina Mess He is very near by this He was not three leagues off when I left him Leon How many gentlemen have you lost in this action Mess But few of any sort and none of name Leon A victory is twice itself when the achiever brings home full numbers I find here that Don Pedro hath bestowed much honour on a young Florentine called Claudio Mess Much deserv'd on his part and equally rememb'red by Don Pedro He hath borne himself beyond the promise of his age doing in the figure of a lamb the feats of a lion He hath indeed better bett'red expectation than you must expect of me to tell you how Leon He hath an uncle here in Messina will be very much glad of it Mess I have already delivered him letters and there appears much joy in him even so much that joy could not show itself modest enough without a badge of bitterness Leon Did he break out into tears Mess In great measure Leon A kind overflow of kindness There are no faces truer than those that are so wash'd How much better is it to weep at joy than to joy at weeping Beat I pray you is Signior Mountanto return'd from the wars or no Mess I know none of that name lady There was none such in the army of any sort Leon What is he that you ask for niece Hero My cousin means Signior Benedick of Padua Mess O he's return'd and as pleasant as ever he was Beat He set up his bills here in Messina and challeng'd Cupid at the flight and my uncle's fool reading the challenge subscrib'd for Cupid and challeng'd him at the burbolt I pray you how many hath he kill'd and eaten in these wars But how many hath he kill'd For indeed I promised to eat all of his killing Leon Faith niece you tax Signior Benedick too much but he'll be meet with you I doubt it not Mess He hath done good service lady in these wars Beat You had musty victual and he hath holp to eat it He is a very valiant trencherman he hath an excellent stomach Mess And a good soldier too lady Beat And a good soldier to a lady but what is he to a lord Mess A lord to a lord a man to a man stuff'd with all honourable virtues Beat It is so indeed He is no less than a stuff'd man but for the stuffingwell we are all mortal Leon You must not sir mistake my niece There is a kind of merry war betwixt Signior Benedick and her They never meet but there's a skirmish of wit between them Beat Alas he gets nothing by that In our last conflict four of his five wits went halting off and now is the whole man govern'd with one so that if he have wit enough to keep himself warm let him bear it for a difference between himself and his horse for it is all the wealth that he hath left to be known a reasonable creature Who is his companion now He hath every month a new sworn brother Mess Is't possible Beat Very easily possible He wears his faith but as the fashion of his hat it ever changes with the next block Mess I see lady the gentleman is not in your books Beat No An he were I would burn my study But I pray you who is his companion Is there no young squarer now that will make a voyage with him to the devil Mess He is most in the company of the right noble Claudio Beat O Lord he will hang upon him like a disease He is sooner caught than the pestilence and the taker runs presently mad God help the noble Claudio If he have caught the Benedick it will cost him a thousand pound ere 'a be cured Mess I will hold friends with you lady Beat Do good friend Leon You will never run mad niece Beat No not till a hot January Mess Don Pedro is approach'dDon Pedro Claudio Benedick Balthasar and John the Bastard Pedro Good Signior Leonato are you come to meet your trouble The fashion of the world is to avoid cost and you encounter it Leon Never came trouble to my house in the likeness of your Grace for trouble being gone comfort should remain but when you depart from me sorrow abides and happiness takes his leave Pedro You embrace your charge too willingly I think this is your daughter Leon Her mother hath many times told me so Bene Were you in doubt sir that you ask'd her Leon Signior Benedick no for then were you a child Pedro You have it full Benedick We may guess by this what you are being a man Truly the lady fathers herself Be happy lady for you are like an honourable father Bene If Signior Leonato be her father she would not have his head on her shoulders for all Messina as like him as she is Beat I wonder that you will still be talking Signior Benedick Nobody marks you Bene What my dear Lady Disdain are you yet living Beat Is it possible Disdain should die while she hath such meet food to feed it as Signior Benedick Courtesy itself must convert to disdain if you come in her presence Bene Then is courtesy a turncoat But it is certain I am loved of all ladies only you excepted and I would I could find in my heart that I had not a hard heart for truly I love none Beat A dear happiness to women They would else have been troubled with a pernicious suitor I thank God and my cold blood I am of your humour for that I had rather hear my dog bark at a crow than a man swear he loves me Bene God keep your ladyship still in that mind So some gentleman or other shall scape a predestinate scratch'd face Beat Scratching could not make it worse an 'twere such a face as yours were Bene Well you are a rare parrotteacher Beat A bird of my tongue is better than a beast of yours Bene I would my horse had the speed of your tongue and so good a continuer But keep your way a God's name I have done Beat You always end with a jade's trick I know you of old Pedro That is the sum of all Leonato Signior Claudio and Signior Benedick my dear friend Leonato hath invited you all I tell him we shall stay here at the least a month and he heartly prays some occasion may detain us longer I dare swear he is no hypocrite but prays from his heart Leon If you swear my lord you shall not be forsworn To Don John Let me bid you welcome my lord Being reconciled to the Prince your brother I owe you all duty John I thank you I am not of many words but I thank you Leon Please it your Grace lead on Pedro Your hand Leonato We will go togetherManent Benedick and Claudio Claud Benedick didst thou note the daughter of Signior Leonato Bene I noted her not but I look'd on her Claud Is she not a modest young lady Bene Do you question me as an honest man should do for my simple true judgment or would you have me speak after my custom as being a professed tyrant to their sex Claud No I pray thee speak in sober judgment Bene Why i' faith methinks she's too low for a high praise too brown for a fair praise and too little for a great praise Only this commendation I can afford her that were she other than she is she were unhandsome and being no other but as she is I do not like her Claud Thou thinkest I am in sport I pray thee tell me truly how thou lik'st her Bene Would you buy her that you enquire after her Claud Can the world buy such a jewel Bene Yea and a case to put it into But speak you this with a sad brow or do you play the flouting Jack to tell us Cupid is a good harefinder and Vulcan a rare carp Come in what key shall a man take you to go in the song Claud In mine eye she is the sweetest lady that ever I look'd on Bene I can see yet without spectacles and I see no such matter There's her cousin an she were not possess'd with a furyexceeds her as much in beauty as the first of May doth the last of December But I hope you have no intent to turn husband have you Claud I would scarce trust myself though I had sworn the contrary if Hero would be my wife Bene Is't come to this In faith hath not the world one man but he will wear his cap with suspicion Shall I never see a bachelor of threescore again Go to i' faith An thou wilt needs thrust thy neck into a yoke wear the print of it and sigh away Sundays Don Pedro Look Don Pedro is returned to seek you Pedro What secret hath held you here that you followed not to Leonato's Bene I would your Grace would constrain me to tell Pedro I charge thee on thy allegiance Bene You hear Count Claudio I can be secret as a dumb man I would have you think so but on my allegiancemark you thison my allegiance he is in love With who Now that is your Grace's part Mark how short his answer is With Hero Leonato's short daughter Claud If this were so so were it utt'red Bene Like the old tale my lord 'It is not so nor 'twas not so but indeed God forbid it should be so' Claud If my passion change not shortly God forbid it should be otherwise Pedro Amen if you love her for the lady is very well worthy Claud You speak this to fetch me in my lord Pedro By my troth I speak my thought Claud And in faith my lord I spoke mine Bene And by my two faiths and troths my lord I spoke mine Claud That I love her I feel Pedro That she is worthy I know Bene That I neither feel how she should be loved nor know how she should be worthy is the opinion that fire cannot melt out of me I will die in it at the stake Pedro Thou wast ever an obstinate heretic in the despite of beauty Claud And never could maintain his part but in the force of his will Bene That a woman conceived me I thank her that she brought me up I likewise give her most humble thanks but that I will have a rechate winded in my forehead or hang my bugle in an invisible baldrick all women shall pardon me Because I will not do them the wrong to mistrust any I will do myself the right to trust none and the fine is for the which I may go the finer I will live a bachelor Pedro I shall see thee ere I die look pale with love Bene With anger with sickness or with hunger my lord not with love Prove that ever I lose more blood with love than I will get again with drinking pick out mine eyes with a balladmaker's pen and hang me up at the door of a brothel house for the sign of blind Cupid Pedro Well if ever thou dost fall from this faith thou wilt prove a notable argument Bene If I do hang me in a bottle like a cat and shoot at me and he that hits me let him be clapp'd on the shoulder and call'd Adam Pedro Well as time shall try 'In time the savage bull doth bear the yoke' Bene The savage bull may but if ever the sensible Benedick bear it pluck off the bull's horns and set them in my forehead and let me be vilely painted and in such great letters as they write 'Here is good horse to hire' let them signify under my sign 'Here you may see Benedick the married man' Claud If this should ever happen thou wouldst be hornmad Pedro Nay if Cupid have not spent all his quiver in Venice thou wilt quake for this shortly Bene I look for an earthquake too then Pedro Well you will temporize with the hours In the meantime good Signior Benedick repair to Leonato's commend me to him and tell him I will not fail him at supper for indeed he hath made great preparation Bene I have almost matter enough in me for such an embassage and so I commit you Claud To the tuition of God From my houseif I had it Pedro The sixth of July Your loving friend Benedick Bene Nay mock not mock not The body of your discourse is sometime guarded with fragments and the guards are but slightly basted on neither Ere you flout old ends any further examine your conscience And so I leave youClaud My liege your Highness now may do me good Pedro My love is thine to teach Teach it but how And thou shalt see how apt it is to learn Any hard lesson that may do thee good Claud Hath Leonato any son my lord Pedro No child but Hero she's his only heir Dost thou affect her Claudio ClaudO my lord When you went onward on this ended action I look'd upon her with a soldier's eye That lik'd but had a rougher task in hand Than to drive liking to the name of love But now I am return'd and that warthoughts Have left their places vacant in their rooms Come thronging soft and delicate desires All prompting me how fair young Hero is Saying I lik'd her ere I went to wars Pedro Thou wilt be like a lover presently And tire the hearer with a book of words If thou dost love fair Hero cherish it And I will break with her and with her father And thou shalt have her Wast not to this end That thou began'st to twist so fine a story Claud How sweetly you do minister to love That know love's grief by his complexion But lest my liking might too sudden seem I would have salv'd it with a longer treatise Pedro What need the bridge much broader than the flood The fairest grant is the necessity Look what will serve is fit 'Tis once thou lovest And I will fit thee with the remedy I know we shall have revelling tonight I will assume thy part in some disguise And tell fair Hero I am Claudio And in her bosom I'll unclasp my heart And take her hearing prisoner with the force And strong encounter of my amorous tale Then after to her father will I break And the conclusion is she shall be thine In practice let us put it presently SceneA room in Leonato's houseat one door Leonato and at another door Antonio an old man brother to Leonato Leon How now brother Where is my cousin your son Hath he provided this music Ant He is very busy about it But brother I can tell you strange news that you yet dreamt not of Leon Are they good Ant As the event stamps them but they have a good cover they show well outward The Prince and Count Claudio walking in a thickpleached alley in mine orchard were thus much overheard by a man of mine the Prince discovered to Claudio that he loved my niece your daughter and meant to acknowledge it this night in a dance and if he found her accordant he meant to take the present time by the top and instantly break with you of it Leon Hath the fellow any wit that told you this Ant A good sharp fellow I will send for him and question him yourself Leon No no We will hold it as a dream till it appear itself but I will acquaint my daughter withal that she may be the better prepared for an answer if peradventure this be true Go you and tell her of it Antonio Antonio's Son with a Musician and others To the Son Cousin you know what you have to do To the Musician O I cry you mercy friend Go you with me and I will use your skillGood cousin have a care this busy timeSceneAnother room in Leonato's houseSir John the Bastard and Conrade his companion Con What the goodyear my lord Why are you thus out of measure sad John There is no measure in the occasion that breeds therefore the sadness is without limit Con You should hear reason John And when I have heard it what blessings brings it Con If not a present remedy at least a patient sufferance John I wonder that thou being as thou say'st thou art born under Saturn goest about to apply a moral medicine to a mortifying mischief I cannot hide what I am I must be sad when I have cause and smile at no man's jests eat when I have stomach and wait for no man's leisure sleep when I am drowsy and tend on no man's business laugh when I am merry and claw no man in his humour Con Yea but you must not make the full show of this till you may do it without controlment You have of late stood out against your brother and he hath ta'en you newly into his grace where it is impossible you should take true root but by the fair weather that you make yourself It is needful that you frame the season for your own harvest John I had rather be a canker in a hedge than a rose in his grace and it better fits my blood to be disdain'd of all than to fashion a carriage to rob love from any In this though I cannot be said to be a flattering honest man it must not be denied but I am a plaindealing villain I am trusted with a muzzle and enfranchis'd with a clog therefore I have decreed not to sing in my cage If I had my mouth I would bite if I had my liberty I would do my liking In the meantime let me be that I am and seek not to alter me Con Can you make no use of your discontent John I make all use of it for I use it only Borachio Who comes here What news Borachio Bora I came yonder from a great supper The Prince your brother is royally tain'd by Leonato and I can give you intelligence of an intended marriage John Will it serve for any model to build mischief on What is he for a fool that betroths himself to unquietness Bora Marry it is your brother's right hand John Who the most exquisite Claudio Bora Even he John A proper squire And who and who which way looks he Bora Marry on Hero the daughter and heir of Leonato John A very forward Marchchick How came you to this Bora Being tain'd for a perfumer as I was smoking a musty room comes me the Prince and Claudio hand in hand in sad conference I whipt me behind the arras and there heard it agreed upon that the Prince should woo Hero for himself and having obtain'd her give her to Count Claudio John Come come let us thither This may prove food to my displeasure That young startup hath all the glory of my overthrow If I can cross him any way I bless myself every way You are both sure and will assist me Con To the death my lord John Let us to the great supper Their cheer is the greater that I am subdued Would the cook were o' my mind Shall we go prove what's to be done Bora We'll wait upon your lordship
