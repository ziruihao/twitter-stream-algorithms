is supplied And Fortune on his damned quarrel smiling Show'd like a rebel's whore But all's too weak For brave Macbeth well he deserves that name Disdaining Fortune with his brandish'd steel Which smoked with bloody execution Like Valor's minion carved out his passage Till he faced the slave Which ne'er shook hands nor bade farewell to him Till he unseam'd him from the nave to the chaps And fix'd his head upon our battlementsO valiant cousin Worthy gentlemanAs whence the sun 'gins his reflection Shipwrecking storms and direful thunders break So from that spring whence comfort seem'd to

received Macbeth The news of thy success and when he reads Thy personal venture in the rebels' fight His wonders and his praises do contend Which should be thine or his Silenced with that In viewing o'er the rest o' the selfsame day He finds thee in the stout Norweyan ranks Nothing afeard of what thyself didst make Strange images of death As thick as hail Came post with post and every one did bear Thy praises in his kingdom's great defense And pour'd them down before himWe are sent To give thee from our royal master thanks Only to herald thee into his sight Not pay theeAnd for an earnest of a greater honor He bade me from him call thee Thane of Cawdor In which addition hail most worthy Thane For it is thineWhat can the devil speak trueThe Thane of Cawdor lives Why do you dress me In borrow'd robesWho was the Thane lives yet But under heavy judgement bears that life Which he deserves to lose Whether he was combined With those of Norway or did line the rebel With hidden help and vantage or that with both He labor'd in his country's wreck I know not But treasons capital confess'd and proved Have overthrown himAside Glamis and Thane of Cawdor The greatest is behind To Ross and Angus Thanks for your pains Aside to Banquo Do you not hope your children shall be kings When those that gave the Thane of Cawdor to me Promised no less to themAside to Macbeth That trusted home Might yet enkindle you unto the crown Besides the Thane of Cawdor But 'tis strange And oftentimes to win us to our harm The instruments of darkness tell us truths Win us with honest trifles to betray's In deepest consequence Cousins a word I pray youAside Two truths are told As happy prologues to the swelling act Of the imperial themeI thank you gentlemen Aside This supernatural soliciting Cannot be ill cannot be good If ill Why hath it given me earnest of success Commencing in a truth I am Thane of Cawdor If good why do I yield to that suggestion Whose horrid image doth unfix my hair And make my seated heart knock at my ribs Against the use of nature Present fears Are less than horrible imaginings My thought whose murther yet is but fantastical Shakes so my single state of man that function

interim having weigh'd it let us speak Our free hearts each to otherVery gladlyTill then enough Come friends Forres The palace FlourishDuncan Malcolm Donalbain Lennox and AttendantsIs execution done on Cawdor Are not Those in commission yet return'dMy liege They are not yet come back But I have spoke With one that saw him die who did report That very frankly he confess'd his treasons Implored your Highness' pardon and set forth A deep repentance Nothing in his life Became him like the leaving it he died As one that had been studied in his death To throw away the dearest thing he owed As 'twere a careless trifleThere's no art To find the mind's construction in the face He was a gentleman on whom I built An absolute trust Macbeth Banquo Ross and Angus O worthiest cousin The sin of my ingratitude even now Was heavy on me Thou art so far before That swiftest wing of recompense is slow To overtake thee Would thou hadst less deserved That the proportion both of thanks and payment Might have been mine Only I have left to say More is thy due than more than all can payThe service and the loyalty lowe In doing it pays itself Your Highness' part Is to receive our duties and our duties Are to your throne and state children and servants Which do but what they should by doing everything Safe toward your love and honorWelcome hither I have begun to plant thee and will labor To make thee full of growing Noble Banquo That hast no less deserved nor must be known No less to have done so let me infold thee And hold thee to my heartThere if I grow The harvest is your ownMy plenteous joys Wanton in fullness seek to hide themselves In drops of sorrow Sons kinsmen thanes And you whose places are the nearest know We will establish our estate upon Our eldest Malcolm whom we name hereafter The Prince of Cumberland which honor must Not unaccompanied invest him only But signs of nobleness like stars shall shine On all deservers From hence to Inverness And bind us further to youThe rest is labor which is not used for you I'll be myself the harbinger and make joyful The hearing of my wife with your approach So humbly take my leaveMy worthy CawdorAside The Prince of Cumberland That is a step On which I must fall down or else o'erleap For in my way it lies Stars hide your fires Let not light see my black and deep desires The eye wink at the hand yet let that be

It is a peerless kinsmanFlourish Inverness Macbeth's castleLady Macbeth reading a letterThey met me in the day of success and I have learned by the perfectest report they have more in them than mortal knowledge When I burned in desire to question them further they made themselves air into which they vanished Whiles I stood rapt in the wonder of it came missives from the King who allhailed me 'Thane of Cawdor' by which title before these weird sisters saluted me and referred me to the coming on of time with 'Hail King that shalt be' This have I thought good to deliver thee my dearest partner of greatness that thou mightst not lose the dues of rejoicing by being ignorant of what greatness is promised thee Lay it to thy heart and farewell Glamis thou art and Cawdor and shalt be What thou art promised Yet do I fear thy nature It is too full o' the milk of human kindness To catch the nearest way Thou wouldst be great Art not without ambition but without The illness should attend it What thou wouldst highly That wouldst thou holily wouldst not play false And yet wouldst wrongly win Thou'ldst have great Glamis That which cries Thus thou must do if thou have it And that which rather thou dost fear to do Than wishest should be undone Hie thee hither That I may pour my spirits in thine ear And chastise with the valor of my tongue All that impedes thee from the golden round Which fate and metaphysical aid doth seem To have thee crown'd withal a Messenger What is your tidingsThe King comes here tonightThou'rt mad to say it Is not thy master with him who were't so Would have inform'd for preparationSo please you it is true our Thane is coming One of my fellows had the speed of him Who almost dead for breath had scarcely more Than would make up his messageGive him tending He brings great news Messenger The raven himself is hoarse That croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan Under my battlements Come you spirits That tend on mortal thoughts unsex me here And fill me from the crown to the toe topfull Of direst cruelty Make thick my blood Stop up the access and passage to remorse That no compunctious visitings of nature Shake my fell purpose nor keep peace between The effect and it Come to my woman's breasts And take my milk for gall your murthering ministers Wherever in your sightless substances You wait on nature's mischief Come thick night And pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell That my keen knife see not the wound it makes Nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark To cry Hold holdMacbeth Great Glamis Worthy Cawdor Greater than both by the allhail hereafter Thy letters have transported me beyond This ignorant present and I feel now The future in the instantMy dearest love Duncan comes here tonightAnd when goes henceTomorrow as he purposesO never Shall sun that morrow see Your face my Thane is as a book where men May read strange matters To beguile the time Look like the time bear welcome in your eye Your hand your tongue look like the innocent flower But be the serpent under it He that's coming Must be provided for and you shall put This night's great business into my dispatch Which shall to all our nights and days to come Give

Banquo Lennox Macduff Ross Angus and AttendantsThis castle hath a pleasant seat the air Nimbly and sweetly recommends itself Unto our gentle sensesThis guest of summer The templehaunting martlet does approve By his loved mansionry that the heaven's breath Smells wooingly here No jutty frieze Buttress nor coign of vantage but this bird Hath made his pendant bed and procreant cradle Where they most breed and haunt I have observed The air is delicate Lady MacbethSee see our honor'd hostess The love that follows us sometime is our trouble Which still we thank as love Herein I teach you How you shall bid God 'ield us for your pains And thank us for your troubleAll our service In every point twice done and then done double Were poor and single business to contend Against those honors deep and broad wherewith Your Majesty loads our house For those of old And the late dignities heap'd up to them We rest your hermitsWhere's the Thane of Cawdor We coursed him at the heels and had a purpose To be his purveyor but he rides well And his great love sharp as his spur hath holp him To his home before us Fair and noble hostess We are your guest tonightYour servants ever Have theirs themselves and

quickly If the assassination Could trammel up the consequence and catch With his surcease success that but this blow Might be the beall and the endall here But here upon this bank and shoal of time We'ld jump the life to come But in these cases We still have judgement here that we but teach Bloody instructions which being taught return To plague the inventor This evenhanded justice Commends the ingredients of our poison'd chalice To our own lips He's here in double trust First as I am his kinsman and his subject Strong both against the deed then as his host Who should against his murtherer shut the door Not bear the knife myself Besides this Duncan Hath borne his faculties so meek hath been So clear in his great office that his virtues Will plead like angels trumpettongued against The deep damnation of his takingoff And pity like a naked newborn babe Striding the blast or heaven's cherubin horsed Upon the sightless couriers of the air Shall blow the horrid deed in every eye That tears shall drown the wind I have no spur To prick the sides of my intent but only Vaulting ambition which o'erleaps itself And falls on the other Lady Macbeth How now what newsHe has almost supp'd Why have you left the chamberHath he ask'd for meKnow you not he hasWe will proceed no further in this business He hath honor'd me of late and I have bought Golden opinions from all sorts of people Which would be worn now in their newest gloss Not cast aside so soonWas the hope drunk Wherein you dress'd yourself Hath it slept since And wakes it now to look so green and pale At what it did so freely From this time Such I account thy love Art thou afeard To be the same in thine own act and valor As thou art in desire Wouldst thou have that Which thou esteem'st the ornament of life And live a coward in thine own esteem Letting I dare not wait upon I would Like the poor cat i' the adagePrithee peace I dare do all that may become a man Who dares do more is noneWhat beast wast then That made you break this prise to me When you durst do it then you were a man And to be more than what you were you would Be so much more the man Nor time nor place Did then adhere and yet you would make both They have made themselves and that their fitness now Does unmake you I have given suck and know How tender 'tis to love the babe that milks me I would while it was smiling in my face Have pluck'd my nipple from his boneless gums And dash'd the brains out had I so sworn as you Have done to thisIf we should failWe fail But screw your courage to the stickingplace And we'll not fail When Duncan is asleep Whereto the rather shall his day's hard journey Soundly invite him his two chamberlains Will I with wine and wassail so convince That memory the warder of the brain Shall be a fume and the receipt of reason A limbeck only When in swinish sleep Their drenched natures lie as in a death What cannot you and I perform upon The unguarded Duncan What not put upon His spongy officers who shall bear the guilt Of our great quellBring forth menchildren only For thy undaunted mettle should compose Nothing but males Will it not be received When we have mark'd with blood those sleepy two Of his own chamber and used their very daggers That they have done'tWho dares receive it other As we shall make our griefs and clamor roar Upon his deathI am settled and bend up Each corporal agent to this terrible feat Away and mock the time with fairest show False face must hide what the false heart doth know
