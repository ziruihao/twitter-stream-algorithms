 SceneThe King's camp near Shrewsburythe King Prince of Wales Lord John of Lancaster Sir Walter Blunt Falstaff King How bloodily the sun begins to peer Above yon busky hill The day looks pale At his distemp'rature Prince The southern wind Doth play the trumpet to his purposes And by his hollow whistling in the leaves Foretells a tempest and a blust'ring day King Theft with the losers let it sympathize For nothing can seem foul to those that winThe trumpet soundsWorcester and Vernon How now my Lord of Worcester 'Tis not well That you and I should meet upon such terms As now we meet You have deceiv'd our trust And made us doff our easy robes of peace To crush our old limbs in ungentle steel This is not well my lord this is not well What say you to it Will you again unknit This churlish knot of allabhorred war And move in that obedient orb again Where you did give a fair and natural light And be no more an exhal'd meteor A prodigy of fear and a portent Of broached mischief to the unborn times Wor Hear me my liege For mine own part I could be well content To tain the lagend of my life With quiet hours for I do protest I have not sought the day of this dislike King You have not sought it How comes it then Fal Rebellion lay in his way and he found it Prince Peace chewet peace Wor It pleas'd your Majesty to turn your looks Of favour from myself and all our house And yet I must remember you my lord We were the first and dearest of your friends For you my staff of office did I break In Richard's time and posted day and night To meet you on the way and kiss your hand When yet you were in place and in account Nothing so strong and fortunate asIt was myself my brother and his son That brought you home and boldly did outdare The dangers of the time You swore to us And you did swear that oath at Doncaster That you did nothing purpose 'gainst the state Nor claim no further than your newfall'n right The seat of Gaunt dukedom of Lancaster To this we swore our aid But in short space It it rain'd down fortune show'ring on your head And such a flood of greatness fell on you What with our help what with the absent King What with the injuries of a wanton time The seeming sufferances that you had borne And the contrarious winds that held the King So long in his unlucky Irish wars That all in England did repute him dead And from this swarm of fair advantages You took occasion to be quickly woo'd To gripe the general sway into your hand Forgot your oath to us at Doncaster And being fed by us you us'd us so As that ungentle gull the cuckoo's bird Useth the sparrow did oppress our nest Grew by our feeding to so great a bulk That even our love thirst not come near your sight For fear of swallowing but with nimble wing We were enforc'd for safety sake to fly Out of your sight and raise this present head Whereby we stand opposed by such means As you yourself have forg'd against yourself By unkind usage dangerous countenance And violation of all faith and troth Sworn to tis in your younger prise King These things indeed you have articulate Proclaim'd at market crosses read in churches To face the garment of rebellion With some fine colour that may please the eye Of fickle changelings and poor discontents Which gape and rub the elbow at the news Of hurlyburly innovation And never yet did insurrection want Such water colours to impaint his cause Nor moody beggars starving for a time Of pellmell havoc and confusion Prince In both our armies there is many a soul Shall pay full dearly for this encounter If once they join in trial Tell your nephew The Prince of Wales doth join with all the world In praise of Henry Percy By my hopes This present prise set off his head I do not think a braver gentleman More activevaliant or more valiantyoung More daring or more bold is now alive To grace this latter age with noble deeds For my part I may speak it to my shame I have a truant been to chivalry And so I hear he doth account me too Yet this before my father's Majesty I am content that he shall take the odds Of his great name and estimation And will to save the blood on either side Try fortune with him in a single fight King And Prince of Wales so dare we venture thee Albeit considerations infinite Do make against it No good Worcester no We love our people well even those we love That are misled upon your cousin's part And will they take the offer of our grace Both he and they and you yea every man Shall be my friend again and I'll be his So tell your cousin and bring me word What he will do But if he will not yield Rebuke and dread correction wait on us And they shall do their office So be gone We will not now be troubled with reply We offer fair take it advisedlyWorcester with Vernon Prince It will not be accepted on my life The Douglas and the Hotspur both together Are confident against the world in arms King Hence therefore every leader to his charge For on their answer will we set on them And God befriend us as our cause is justManent Prince Falstaff Fal Hal if thou see me down in the battle and bestride me so 'Tis a point of friendship Prince Nothing but a Colossus can do thee that friendship Say thy prayers and farewell Fal I would 'twere bedtime Hal and all well Prince Why thou owest God a deathFal 'Tis not due yet I would be loath to pay him before his day What need I be so forward with him that calls not on me Well 'tis no matter honour pricks me on Yea but how if honour prick me off when I come on How then Can honor set to a leg No Or an arm No Or take away the grief of a wound No Honour hath no skill in surgery then No What is honour A word What is that word honour Air A trim reckoning Who hath it He that died a Wednesday Doth he feel it No Doth be bear it No 'Tis insensible then Yea to the dead But will it not live with the living No Why Detraction will not suffer it Therefore I'll none of it Honour is a mere scutcheon and so ends my catechism SceneThe rebel campWorcester and Sir Richard Vernon Wor O no my nephew must not know Sir Richard The liberal and kind offer of the King Ver 'Twere best he did Wor Then are we all undone It is not possible it cannot be The King should keep his word in loving us He will suspect us still and find a time To punish this offence in other faults Suspicion all our lives shall be stuck full of eyes For treason is but trusted like the fox Who ne'er so tame so cherish'd and lock'd up Will have a wild trick of his ancestors Look how we can or sad or merrily Interpretation will misquote our looks And we shall feed like oxen at a stall The better cherish'd still the nearer death My nephew's trespass may be well forgot It hath the excuse of youth and heat of blood And an adopted name of privilege A harebrained Hotspur govern'd by a spleen All his offences live upon my head And on his father's We did train him on And his corruption being taken from us We as the spring of all shall pay for all Therefore good cousin let not Harry know In any case the offer of the King Hotspur and Douglas Ver Deliver what you will I'll say 'tis so Here comes your cousin Hot My uncle is return'd Deliver up my Lord of

rebels traitors aid will scourge With haughty arms this hateful name in us Douglas Doug Arm gentlemen to arms for I have thrown A brave defiance in King Henry's teeth And Westmoreland that was engag'd did bear it Which cannot choose but bring him quickly on Wor The Prince of Wales stepp'd forth before the King And nephew challeng'd you to single fight Hot O would the quarrel lay upon our heads And that no man might draw short breath today But I and Harry Monmouth Tell me tell me How show'd his tasking Seem'd it in contempt No by my soul I never in my life Did hear a challenge urg'd more modestly Unless a brother should a brother dare To gentle exercise and proof of arms He gave you all the duties of a man Trimm'd up your praises with a princely tongue Spoke your deservings like a chronicle Making you ever better than his praise By still dispraising praise valued with you And which became him like a prince indeed He made a blushing cital of himself And chid his truant youth with such a grace As if lie mast'red there a double spirit Of teaching and of learning instantly There did he pause but let me tell the world If he outlive the envy of this day England did never owe so sweet a hope So much misconstrued in his wantonness Hot Cousin I think thou art enamoured Upon his follies Never did I hear Of any prince so wild a libertine But be he as he will yet once ere night I will embrace him with a soldier's arm That he shall shrink under my courtesy Arm arm with speed and fellows soldiers friends Better consider what you have to do Than I that have not well the gift of tongue Can lift your blood up with persuasion a Messenger Mess My lord here are letters for you Hot I cannot read them now O gentlemen the time of life is short To spend that shortness basely were too long If life did ride upon a dial's point Still ending at the arrival of an hour An if we live we live to tread on kings If die brave death when princes die with us Now for our consciences the arms are fair When the intent of bearing them is justanother Messenger Mess My lord prepare The King comes on apace Hot I thank him that he cuts me from my tale For I profess not talking Only this Let each man do his best and here draw I A sword whose temper I intend to stain With the best blood that I can meet withal In the adventure of this perilous day Now Esperance Percy and set on Sound all the
