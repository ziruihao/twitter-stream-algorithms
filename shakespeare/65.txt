seeing what is likely to ensue This late dissension grown betwixt the peers Burns under feigned ashes of forg'd love And will at last break out into a flame As fest'red members rot but by degree Till bones and flesh and sinews fall away So will this base and envious discord breed And now I fear that fatal prophecy Which in the time of Henry nam'd the Fifth Was in the mouth of every sucking babe That Henry born at Monmouth should win all And Henry born at Windsor should lose all Which is so plain that Exeter doth wish His days may finish ere that hapless timeFrance Before Rouendisguis'd with

all amort Rouen hangs her head for grief That such a valiant company are fled Now will we take some order in the town Placing therein some expert officers And then depart to Paris to the King For there young Henry with his nobles lieWhat Lord Talbot pleaseth BurgundyBut yet before we go let's not forget The noble Duke of Bedford late deceas'd But see his exequies fulfill'd in Rouen A braver soldier never couched lance A gentler heart did never sway in court But kings and mightiest potentates must die For that's the end of human misery The plains near Rouen the and forcesDismay not Princes at this accident Nor grieve that Rouen is so recovered Care is no cure but rather corrosive For things that are not to be remedied Let frantic Talbot triumph for a while And like a peacock sweep along his tail We'll pull his plumes and take away his train If Dauphin and the rest will be but rul'dWe have guided by thee hitherto And of thy cunning had no diffidence One sudden foil shall never breed distrustSearch out thy wit for secret policies And we will make thee famous through the worldWe'll set thy statue in some holy place And have thee reverenc'd like a blessed saint Employ
