 Navarre Navarre The King's parkthe King and Let fame that all hunt after in their lives Live regist'red upon our brazen tombs And then grace us in the disgrace of death When spite of cormorant devouring Time Th' endeavour of this present breath may buy That honour which shall bate his scythe's keen edge And make us heirs of all eternity Therefore brave conquerors for so you are That war against your own affections And the huge army of the world's desires Our late edict shall strongly stand in force Navarre shall be the wonder of the world Our court shall be a little Academe Still and contemplative in living art You three Berowne Dumain and Longaville Have sworn for three years' term to live with me My fellowscholars and to keep those statutes That are recorded in this schedule here Your oaths are pass'd and now subscribe your names That his own hand may strike his honour down That violates the smallest branch herein If you are arm'd to do as sworn to do Subscribe to your deep oaths and keep it tooI am resolv'd 'tis but a three years' fast The mind shall banquet though the body pine Fat paunches have lean pates and dainty bits Make rich the ribs but bankrupt quite the witsMy loving lord Dumain is mortified The grosser manner of these world's delights He throws upon the gross world's baser slaves To love to wealth to pomp I pine and die With all these living in philosophyI can but say their protestation over So much dear liege I have already sworn That is to live and study here three years But there are other strict observances As not to see a woman in that term Which I hope well is not enrolled there And one day in a week to touch no food And but one meal on every day beside The which I hope is not enrolled there And then to sleep but three hours in the night And not be seen to wink of all the day When I was wont to think no harm all night And make a dark night too of half the day Which I hope well is not enrolled there O these are barren tasks too hard to keep Not to see ladies study fast not sleepYour oath is pass'd to pass away from theseLet me say no my liege an if you please I only swore to study with your Grace And stay here in your court for three years' spaceYou swore to that Berowne and to the restBy yea and nay sir then I swore in jest What is the end of study let me knowWhy that to know which else we should not knowThings hid and barr'd you mean from common senseAy that is study's godlike recompenseCome on then I will swear to study so To know the thing I am forbid to know As thus to study where I well may dine When I to feast expressly am forbid Or study where to meet some mistress fine When mistresses from common sense are hid Or having sworn too hardakeeping oath Study to break it and not break my troth If study's gain be thus and this be so Study knows that which yet it doth not know Swear me to this and I will ne'er say noThese be the stops that hinder study quite And train our intellects to vain delightWhy all delights are vain but that most vain Which with pain purchas'd doth inherit pain As painfully to pore upon a book To seek the light of truth while truth the while Doth falsely blind the eyesight of his look Light seeking light doth light of light beguile So ere you find where light in darkness lies Your light grows dark by losing of your eyes Study me how to please the eye indeed By fixing it upon a fairer eye Who dazzling so that eye shall be his heed And give him light that it was blinded by Study is like the heaven's glorious sun That will not be deepsearch'd with saucy looks Small have continual plodders ever won Save base authority from others' books These earthly godfathers of heaven's lights That give a name to every fixed star Have no more profit of their shining nights Than those that walk and wot not what they are Too much to know is to know nought but fame And every godfather can give a nameHow well he's read to reason against readingProceeded well to stop all good proceedingHe weeds the corn and still lets grow the weedingThe spring is near when green geese are abreedingHow follows thatFit in his place and timeIn reason nothingSomething then in rhymeBerowne is like an envious sneaping frost That bites the firstborn infants of the springWell say I am why should proud summer boast Before the birds have any cause to sing Why should I joy in any abortive birth At Christmas I no more desire a rose Than wish a snow in May's newfangled shows But like of each thing that in season grows So you to study now it is too late Climb o'er the house to unlock the little gateWell sit out go home Berowne adieuNo my good lord I have sworn to stay with you And though I have for barbarism spoke more Than for that angel knowledge you can say Yet confident I'll keep what I have swore And bide the penance of each three years' day Give me the paper let me read the same And to the strictest decrees I'll write my nameHow well this yielding rescues thee from shameReads 'Item That no woman shall come within a mile of my court' Hath this been proclaimedFour days agoLet's see the penalty Reads 'on pain of losing her tongue' Who devis'd this penaltyMarry that did Sweet lord and whyTo fright them hence with that dread penaltyA dangerous law against gentility Reads 'Item If any man be seen to talk with a woman within the term of three years he shall endure such public shame as the rest of the court can possibly devise' This article my liege yourself must break For well you know here comes in embassy The French king's daughter with yourself to speak A mild of grace and complete majesty About surrender up of Aquitaine To her decrepit sick and bedrid father Therefore this article is made in vain Or vainly comes th' admired princess hitherWhat say you lords Why this was quite forgotSo study evermore is overshot While it doth study to have what it would It doth forget to do the thing it should And when it hath the thing it hunteth most 'Tis won as towns with fire so won so lostWe must of force dispense with this decree She must lie here on mere necessityNecessity will make us all forsworn Three thousand times within this three years' space For every man with his affects is born Not by might mast'red but by special grace If I break faith this word shall speak for me I am forsworn on mere necessity So to the laws at large I write my nameSubscribes And he that breaks them in the least degree Stands in attainder of eternal shame Suggestions are to other as to me But I believe although I seem so loath I am the last that will last keep his oath But is there no quick recreation grantedAy that there is Our court you know is haunted With a refined traveller of Spain A man in all the world's new fashion planted That hath a mint of phrases in his brain One who the music of his own vain tongue Doth ravish like enchanting harmony A man of complements whom right and wrong Have chose as umpire of their mutiny This child of fancy that Armado hight For interim to our studies shall relate In highborn words the worth of many a knight From tawny Spain lost in the world's debate How you delight my lords I know not I But I protest I love to hear him lie And I will use him for my minstrelsyArmado is a most illustrious wight A man of firenew words fashion's own knightCostard the swain and he shall be our sport And so to study three years is but short a constable with a letter and Which is the Duke's own personThis fellow What wouldstI myself reprehend his own person for I am his Grace's farborough but I would see his own person in flesh and

that one of the four complexionsAs I have read sir and the best of them tooGreen indeed is the colour of lovers but to have a love of that colour methinks Samson had small reason for it He surely

and therefore I can be quiet I do affect the very ground which is base where her shoe which is baser guided by her foot which is basest doth tread I shall be forsworn which is a great argument of falsehood if I love And how can that be true love which is falsely attempted Love is a familiar Love is a devil There is no evil angel but Love Yet was Samson so tempted and he had an excellent strength yet was Solomon so seduced and he had a very good wit Cupid's buttshaft is too hard for Hercules' club and therefore too much odds for a Spaniard's rapier The first and second cause will not
