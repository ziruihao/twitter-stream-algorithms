Fife Macduff's castleLady Macduff her Son and RossWhat had he done to make him fly the landYou must have patience madamHe had none His flight was madness When our actions do not Our fears do make us traitorsYou know not Whether it was his wisdom or his fearWisdom To leave his wife to leave his babes His mansion and his titles in a place From whence himself does fly He loves us not He wants the natural touch for the poor wren The most diminutive of birds will fight Her young ones in her nest against the owl All is the fear and nothing is the love As little is the wisdom where the flight So runs against all reasonMy dearest coz I pray you school yourself But for your husband He is noble wise Judicious and best knows The fits o' the season I dare not speak much further But cruel are the times when we are traitors And do not know ourselves when we hold rumor From what we fear yet know not what we fear But float upon a wild and violent sea Each way and move I take my leave of you Shall

MacduffLet us seek out some desolate shade and there Weep our sad bosoms emptyLet us rather Hold fast the mortal sword and like good men Bestride our downfall'n birthdom Each new morn New widows howl new orphans cry new sorrows Strike heaven on the face that it resounds As if it felt with Scotland and yell'd out Like syllable of dolorWhat I believe I'll wall What know believe and what I can redress As I shall find the time to friend I will What you have spoke it may be so perchance This tyrant whose sole name blisters our tongues Was once thought honest You have loved him well He hath not touch'd you yet I am young but something You may deserve of him through me and wisdom To offer up a weak poor innocent lamb To appease an angry godI am not treacherousBut Macbeth is A good and virtuous nature may recoil In an imperial charge But I shall crave your pardon That which you are my thoughts cannot transpose Angels are bright still though the brightest fell Though all things foul would wear the brows of grace Yet grace must still look soI have lost my hopesPerchance even there where I did find my doubts Why in that rawness left you wife and child Those precious motives those strong knots of love Without leavetaking I pray you Let not my jealousies be your dishonors But mine own safeties You may be rightly just Whatever I shall thinkBleed bleed poor country Great tyranny lay thou thy basis sure For goodness dare not check thee Wear thou thy wrongs The title is affeer'd Fare thee well lord I would not be the villain that thou think'st For the whole space that's in the tyrant's grasp And the rich East to bootBe not offended I speak not as in absolute fear of you I think our country sinks beneath the yoke It weeps it bleeds and each new day a gash Is added to her wounds I think withal There would be hands uplifted in my right And here from gracious England have I offer Of goodly thousands But for all this When I shall tread upon the tyrant's head Or wear it on my sword yet my poor country Shall have more vices than it had before More suffer and more sundry ways than ever By him that shall succeedWhat should he beIt is myself I mean in whom I know All the particulars of vice so grafted That when they shall be open'd black Macbeth Will seem as pure as snow and the poor state Esteem him as a lamb being compared With my confineless harmsNot in the legions Of horrid hell can come a devil more damn'd In evils to top MacbethI grant him bloody Luxurious avaricious false deceitful Sudden malicious smacking of every sin That has a name But there's no bottom none In my voluptuousness Your wives your daughters Your matrons and your maids could not fill up The cestern of my lust and my desire All continent impediments would o'erbear That did oppose my will Better Macbeth Than such an one to reignBoundless intemperance In nature is a tyranny it hath been The untimely emptying of the happy throne And fall of many kings But fear not yet To take upon you what is yours You may Convey your pleasures in a spacious plenty And yet seem cold the time you may so hoodwink We have willing dames enough there cannot be That vulture in you to devour so many As will to greatness dedicate themselves Finding it so inclinedWith this there grows In my most illcomposed affection such A stanchless avarice that were I King I should cut off the nobles for their lands Desire his jewels and this other's house And my morehaving would be as a sauce To make me hunger more that I should forge Quarrels unjust against the good and loyal Destroying them for wealthThis avarice Sticks deeper grows with more pernicious root Than summerseeming lust and it hath been The sword of our slain kings Yet do not fear Scotland hath foisons to fill up your will Of your mere own All these are portable With other graces weigh'dBut I have none The kingbecoming graces As justice verity temperance stableness Bounty perseverance mercy lowliness Devotion patience courage fortitude I have no relish of them but abound In the division of each several crime Acting it many ways Nay had I power I should Pour the sweet milk of concord into hell Uproar the universal peace confound All unity on earthO Scotland ScotlandIf such a one be fit to govern speak I am as I have spokenFit to govern No not to live O nation miserable With an untitled tyrant bloodyscepter'd When shalt thou see thy wholesome days again Since that the truest issue of thy throne By his own interdiction stands accursed And does blaspheme his breed Thy royal father Was a most sainted king the queen that bore thee Oftener upon her knees than on her feet Died every day she lived Fare thee well These evils thou repeat'st upon thyself Have banish'd me from Scotland O my breast Thy hope ends hereMacduff this noble passion Child of integrity hath from my soul Wiped the black scruples reconciled my thoughts To thy good truth and honor Devilish Macbeth By many of these trains hath sought to win me Into his power and modest wisdom plucks me From overcredulous haste But God above Deal between thee and me For even now I put myself to thy direction and Unspeak mine own detraction here abjure The taints and blames I laid upon myself For strangers to my nature I am yet Unknown to woman never was forsworn Scarcely have coveted what was mine own At no time broke my faith would not betray The devil to his fellow and delight No less in truth than life My first false speaking Was this upon myself What I am truly Is thine and my poor country's to command Whither indeed before thy hereapproach

often since my hereremain in England I have seen him do How he solicits heaven Himself best knows but strangelyvisited people All swol'n and ulcerous pitiful to the eye The mere despair of surgery he cures Hanging a golden stamp about their necks Put on with holy prayers and 'tis spoken To the succeeding royalty he leaves The healing benediction With this strange virtue He hath a heavenly gift of

betimes remove The means that makes us strangersSir amenStands Scotland where it didAlas poor country Almost afraid to know itself It cannot Be call'd our mother but our grave Where nothing But who knows nothing is once seen to smile Where sighs and groans and shrieks that rend the air Are made not mark'd where violent sorrow seems A modern ecstasy The dead man's knell Is there scarce ask'd for who and good men's lives Expire before the flowers in their caps Dying or ere they sickenO relation Too nice and yet too trueWhat's the newest griefThat of an hour's age doth hiss the speaker Each minute teems a new oneHow does my wifeWhy wellAnd all my childrenWell tooThe tyrant has not batter'd at their peaceNo they were well at peace when I did leave 'emBe not a niggard of your speech How goestWhen I came hither to transport the tidings Which I have heavily borne there ran a rumor Of many worthy fellows that were out Which was to my belief witness'd the rather For that I saw the tyrant's power afoot Now is the time of help your eye in Scotland Would create soldiers make our women fight To doff their dire distressesBe't their comfort We are coming thither Gracious England hath Lent us good Siward and ten thousand men An older and a better soldier none That Christendom gives outWould I could answer This comfort with the like But I have words That would be howl'd out in the desert air Where hearing should not latch themWhat concern they The general cause Or is it a feegrief Due to some single breastNo mind that's honest But in it shares some woe though the main part Pertains to you aloneIf it be mine Keep it not from me quickly let me have itLet not your ears despise my tongue forever Which shall possess them with the heaviest sound That ever yet they heardHumh I

your hat upon your brows Give sorrow words The grief that does not speak Whispers the o'erfraught heart and bids it breakMy children tooWife children servants all That could be foundAnd I must be from thence My wife kill'd tooI have saidBe comforted Let's make us medicines of our great revenge To cure this deadly griefHe has no children All my pretty ones Did you say all O hellkite All What all my pretty chickens and their dam At one fell swoopDispute it like a manI shall do so But I must also feel it as a man I cannot but remember such things were That were most precious to me Did heaven look on And would not take their part Sinful Macduff They were all struck for thee Naught that I am Not for their own demerits but for mine Fell slaughter on their souls Heaven rest them nowBe this the whetstone of your sword Let grief Convert to anger blunt not the heart enrage itO I could play the woman with mine eyes And braggart with my tongue But gentle heavens Cut short all intermission front to front Bring thou this fiend of Scotland and myself Within my sword's length set him if he 'scape Heaven forgive him tooThis tune goes manly Come go we to the King our power is ready Our lack is nothing but our leave Macbeth Is ripe for shaking and the powers above Put on their instruments Receive what cheer you may The night is long that never finds the day
