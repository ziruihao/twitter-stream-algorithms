whole towns to fly What tidings with our cousin BuckinghamSuch as my heart doth tremble to unfold A sort of naughty persons lewdly bent Under the countenance and confederacy Of Lady Eleanor the Protector's wife The ringleader and head of all this rout Have practis'd dangerously against your state Dealing with witches and with conjurers Whom we have apprehended in the fact Raising up wicked spirits from under ground Demanding of King Henry's life and death And other of your Highness' Privy Council As more at large your Grace shall understandAnd so my Lord Protector by this means Your lady is forthcoming yet at London This news I think hath turn'd your weapon's edge 'Tis like my lord you will not keep your hourAmbitious churchman leave to afflict my heart Sorrow and grief have vanquish'd all my powers And vanquish'd as I am I yield to the Or to the meanest groomO God what mischiefs work the wicked ones Heaping confusion on their own heads therebyGloucester see here the tainture of thy nest And look thyself be faultless thou wert bestMadam for myself to heaven I do appeal How I have lov'd my King and commonweal And for my wife I know not how it stands Sorry I am to hear what I have heard Noble she is but if she have forgot Honour and virtue and convers'd with such As like to pitch defile nobility I banish her my bed and company And give her as a prey to law and shame That hath dishonoured Gloucester's honest nameWell for this night we will repose us here Tomorrow toward London back again To look into this business thoroughly And call these foul offenders to their answers And poise the cause in justice' equal scales Whose beam stands sure whose rightful cause prevails Flourish London The gardenand Now my good Lords of Salisbury and Warwick Our simple supper ended give me leave In this close walk to satisfy myself In craving your opinion of my tide Which is infallible to England's crownMy lord I long to hear it at fullSweet York begin and if thy claim be good The Nevils are thy subjects to commandThen thus Edward the Third my lords had seven sons The first Edward the Black Prince Prince of Wales The second William of Hatfield and the third Lionel Duke of Clarence next to whom Was John of Gaunt the Duke of Lancaster The fifth was Edmund Langley Duke of York The sixth was Thomas of Woodstock Duke of Gloucester William of Windsor was the seventh and last Edward the Black Prince died before his father And left behind him Richard his only son Who after Edward the Third's death reign'd as king Till Henry Bolingbroke Duke of Lancaster The eldest son and heir of John of Gaunt Crown'd by the name of Henry the Fourth Seiz'd on the realm depos'd the rightful king Sent his poor queen to France from whence she came And him to Pomfret where as all you know Harmless Richard was murdered traitorouslyFather the Duke hath told the truth Thus got the house of Lancaster the crownWhich now they hold by force and not by right For Richard the first son's heir being dead The issue of the next son should have reign'dBut William of Hatfield died without an heirThe third son Duke of Clarence from whose line I claim the crown had issue Philippe a daughter Who married Edmund Mortimer Earl of March Edmund had issue Roger Earl of March Roger had issue Edmund Anne and EleanorThis Edmund in the reign of Bolingbroke As I have read laid claim unto the crown And but for Owen Glendower had been king Who kept him in captivity till he died But to the restHis eldest sister Anne My mother being heir unto the crown Married Richard Earl of Cambridge who was To Edmund Langley Edward the Third's fifth son son By her I claim the kingdom she was heir To Roger Earl of March who was the son Of Edmund Mortimer who married Philippe Sole daughter unto Lionel Duke of Clarence So if the issue of the elder son Succeed before the younger I am KingWhat plain proceedings is more plain than this Henry doth claim the crown from John of Gaunt The fourth son York claims it from the third Till Lionel's issue fails his should not reign It fails not yet but flourishes in thee And in thy sons fair slips of such a stock Then father Salisbury kneel we together And in this private plot be we the first That shall salute our rightful sovereign With honour of his birthright to the crownLong live our sovereign Richard England's KingWe thank you lords But I am not your king Till I be crown'd and that my sword be stain'd With heartblood of the house of Lancaster And that's not suddenly to be perform'd But with advice and silent secrecy Do you as I do in these dangerous days Wink at the Duke of Suffolk's insolence At Beaufort's pride at Somerset's ambition At Buckingham and all the crew of them Till they have snar'd the shepherd of the flock That virtuous prince the good Duke Humphrey 'Tis that they seek and they in seeking that Shall find their deaths if York can prophesyMy lord break we off we know your mind at fullMy heart assures me that

sometimes hath the brightest day a cloud And after summer evermore succeeds Barren winter with his wrathful nipping cold So cares and joys abound as seasons fleet Sirs what's o'clockTen my lordTen is the hour that was appointed me To watch the coming of my punish'd duchess Uneath may she endure the flinty streets To tread them with her tenderfeeling feet Sweet Nell ill can thy noble mind abrook The abject people gazing on thy face With envious looks laughing at thy shame That erst did follow thy proud chariot wheels When thou didst ride in triumph through the streets But soft I think she comes and I'll prepare My tearstain'd eyes to see her miseriesthein a white sheet and a taper burning in her hand withtheand So please your Grace we'll take her from the sheriffNo stir not for your lives let her pass byCome you my lord to see my open shame Now thou dost penance too Look how they gaze See how the giddy multitude do point And nod their heads and throw their eyes on thee Ah Gloucester hide thee from their hateful looks And in thy closet pent up rue my shame And ban thine enemies both mine and thineBe patient gentle Nell forget this griefAh Gloucester teach me to forget myself For whilst I think I am thy married wife And thou a prince Protector of this land Methinks I should not thus be led along Mail'd up in shame with papers on my back And follow'd with a rabble that rejoice To see my tears and hear my deepfet groans The ruthless flint doth cut my tender feet And when I start the envious people laugh And bid me be advised how I tread Ah Humphrey can I bear this shameful yoke Trowest thou that e'er I'll look upon the world Or count them happy that enjoy the sun No dark shall be my light and night my day To think upon my pomp shall be my hell Sometimes I'll say I am Duke Humphrey's wife And he a prince and ruler of the land Yet so he rul'd and such a prince he was As he stood by whilst I his forlorn duchess Was made a wonder and a pointingstock To every idle rascal follower But be thou mild and blush not at my shame Nor stir at nothing till the axe of death Hang over thee as sure it shortly will For Suffolk he that can do all in all With her that hateth thee and hates us all And York and impious Beaufort that false priest Have all lim'd bushes to betray thy wings And fly thou how thou canst they'll tangle thee But fear not thou until thy foot be snar'd Nor never seek prevention of thy foesAh Nell forbear Thou aimest all awry I must offend before I be attainted And had I twenty times so many foes And each of them had twenty times their power All these could not procure me any scathe So long as I am loyal true and crimeless Wouldst have me rescue thee from this reproach Why yet thy scandal were not wip'd away But I in danger for the breach of law Thy greatest help is quiet gentle Nell I pray thee sort thy heart to patience These few days' wonder will be quickly worna I summon your Grace to his Majesty's Parliament Holden at Bury the first of this next monthAnd my consent ne'er ask'd herein before This is close dealing Well I will be thereMy Nell I take my leave and master sheriff Let not her penance exceed the King's
