Troy A streetat one sideand servant with a torch at anotherthe Grecian and others with torchesSee ho Who is that thereIt is the Lord AeneasIs the Prince there in person Had I so good occasion to lie long As you Prince Paris nothing but heavenly business Should rob my bedmate of my companyThat's my mind too Good morrow Lord AeneasA valiant Greek Aeneas take his hand Witness the process of your speech wherein You told how Diomed a whole week by days Did haunt you in the fieldHealth to you valiant sir During all question of the gentle truce But when I meet you arm'd as black defiance As heart can think or courage executeThe one and other Diomed embraces Our bloods are now in calm and so long health But when contention and occasion meet By Jove I'll play the hunter for thy life With all my force pursuit and policyAnd thou shalt hunt a lion that will fly With his face backward In humane gentleness Welcome to Troy now by Anchises' life Welcome indeed By Venus' hand I swear No man alive can love in such a sort The thing he means to kill more excellentlyWe sympathise Jove let Aeneas live If to my sword his fate be not the glory A thousand complete courses of the sun But in mine emulous honour let him die With every joint a wound and that tomorrowWe know each other well We do and long to know each other worseThis is the most despiteful'st gentle greeting The noblest hateful love that e'er I heard of What business lord so earlyI was sent for to the King but why I know notHis purpose meets you 'twas to bring this Greek To Calchas' house and there to render him For the enfreed Antenor the fair Cressid Let's have your company or if you please Haste there before us I constantly believe Or rather call my thought a certain knowledge My brother Troilus lodges there

goodfellowship Who in your thoughts deserves fair Helen best Myself or MenelausBoth alike He merits well to have her that doth seek her Not making any scruple of her soilure With such a hell of pain and world of charge And you as well to keep her that defend her Not palating the taste of her dishonour With such a costly loss of wealth and friends He like a puling cuckold would drink up The lees and dregs of a flat tamed piece You like a lecher out of whorish loins Are pleas'd to breed out your inheritors Both merits pois'd each weighs nor less nor more But he as he the heavier for a whoreYou are too bitter to your countrywomanShe's bitter to her country Hear me Paris For every false drop in her bawdy veins A Grecian's life hath sunk for every scruple Of her contaminated carrion weight A Troyan hath been slain since she could speak She hath not given so many good words breath As for her Greeks and Troyans suff'red deathFair Diomed you do as chapmen do Dispraise the thing that you desire to buy But we in silence hold this virtue well We'll not commend what we intend to sell Here lies our way Troy The court of ' houseand Dear trouble not yourself the morn is coldThen sweet my

forgot my father I know no touch of consanguinity No kin no love no blood no soul so near me As the sweet Troilus O you gods divine Make Cressid's name the very crown of falsehood If ever she leave Troilus Time force and death Do to this body what extremes you can But the strong base and building of my love Is as the very centre of the earth Drawing all things to it I'll go in and weepDo doTear my bright hair and scratch my praised cheeks Crack my clear voice with sobs and break my heart With sounding 'Troilus' I will not go from Troy Troy A street before ' house and It is great morning and the hour prefix'd For her delivery to this valiant Greek Comes fast upon Good my brother Troilus Tell you the lady what she is to do And haste her to the purposeWalk into her house I'll bring her to the Grecian presently And to his hand when I deliver her Think it an altar and thy brother Troilus A priest there off'ring to it his own heartI know what 'tis to love And would as I shall pity I could help Please you walk in my lordsTroy ' houseand Be moderate be moderateWhy tell you me of moderation The grief is fine full perfect that I taste And violenteth in a sense as strong As that which causeth it How can I moderate it If I could temporize with my affections Or brew it to a weak and colder palate The like allayment could I give my grief My love admits no qualifying dross No more my grief in such a precious lossHere here here he comes Ah sweet ducksO Troilus Troilus Embracing himWhat a pair of spectacles is here Let me embrace too 'O heart' as the goodly saying is O heart heavy heartWhy sigh'st thou without breaking where he answers againBecause thou canst not ease thy smartBy friendship nor by speaking There was never a truer rhyme Let us cast away nothing for we may live to have need of such a verse We see it we see it How now lambsCressid I love thee in so strain'd a purity That the bless'd gods as angry with my fancy More bright in zeal than the devotion which Cold lips blow to their deities take thee from meHave the gods envyAy ay ay 'tis too plain a caseAnd is it true that I must go from TroyA hateful truthWhat and from Troilus tooFrom Troy and TroilusIs't possibleAnd suddenly where injury of chance Puts back leavetaking justles roughly by All time of pause rudely beguiles our lips Of all rejoindure forcibly prevents Our lock'd embrasures strangles our dear vows Even in the birth of our own labouring breath We two that with so many thousand sighs Did buy each other must poorly sell ourselves With the rude brevity and discharge of one Injurious time now with a robber's haste Crams his rich thievery up he knows not how As many farewells as be stars in heaven With distinct breath and consign'd kisses to them He fumbles up into a loose adieu And scants us with a single famish'd kiss Distasted with the salt of broken tearsWithin My lord is the lady readyHark you are call'd Some say the Genius so Cries 'Come' to him that instantly must die Bid them have patience she shall come anonWhere are my tears Rain to lay this wind or my heart will be blown up by th' rootI must then to the GreciansNo remedyA woeful Cressid 'mongst the merry Greeks When shall we see againHear me my love Be thou but true of heartI true how now What wicked deem is thisNay we must use expostulation kindly For it is parting from us I speak not 'Be thou true' as fearing thee For I will throw my glove to Death himself That there's no maculation in thy heart But 'Be thou true' say I to fashion in My sequent protestation be thou true And I will see theeO you shall be expos'd my lord to dangers As infinite as imminent But I'll be trueAnd I'll grow friend with danger Wear this sleeveAnd you this glove When shall I see youI will corrupt the Grecian sentinels To give thee nightly visitation But yet be trueO heavens 'Be true' againHear why I speak it love The Grecian youths are full of quality They're loving well compos'd with gifts of nature And flowing o'er with arts and exercise How novelties may move and parts with person Alas a kind of godly jealousy Which I beseech you call a virtuous sin Makes me afeardO heavens you love me notDie I a villain then In this I do not call your faith in question So mainly as my merit I cannot sing Nor heel the high lavolt nor sweeten talk Nor play at subtle gamesfair virtues all To which the Grecians are most prompt and pregnant But I can tell that in each grace of these There lurks a still and dumbdiscoursive devil That tempts most cunningly But be not temptedDo you think I willNo But something may be done that we will not And sometimes we are devils to ourselves When we will tempt the frailty of our powers Presuming on their changeful potencyWithin Nay good my lordCome kiss and let us partWithin Brother TroilusGood brother come you hither And bring Aeneas and the Grecian with youMy lord will you be trueWho I Alas it is my vice my fault Whiles others fish with craft for great opinion I with great truth catch mere simplicity Whilst some with cunning gild their copper crowns With truth and plainness I do wear mine bareandFear not my truth the moral of my wit Is 'plain and true' there's all the reach of it Welcome Sir Diomed Here is the lady Which for Antenor we deliver you At the port lord I'll give her to thy hand And by the way possess thee what she is Entreat her fair and by my soul fair Greek If e'er thou stand at mercy of my sword Name Cressid and thy life shall be as safe As Priam is in IlionFair Lady Cressid So please you save the thanks this prince expects The lustre in your

lust And know you lord I'll nothing do on charge to her own worth She shall be priz'd But that you say 'Be't so' I speak it in my spirit and honour 'No'Come to the port I'll tell thee Diomed This

fair Anticipating time with starting courage Give with thy trumpet a loud note to Troy Thou dreadful Ajax that the appalled air May pierce the head of the great combatant And hale him hitherThou trumpet there's my purse Now crack thy lungs and split thy brazen pipe Blow villain till thy sphered bias cheek Outswell the colic of puff Aquilon'd Come stretch thy chest and let thy eyes spout blood Thou blowest for Hector Trumpet soundsNo trumpet answers'Tis but early days with Is not yond Diomed with Calchas' daughter'Tis he I ken the manner of his gait He rises on the toe That spirit of his In aspiration lifts him from the earthIs this the lady CressidEven sheMost dearly welcome to the Greeks sweet ladyOur general doth salute you with a kissYet is the kindness but particular 'Twere better she were kiss'd in generalAnd very courtly counsel I'll begin So much for NestorI'll take that winter from your lips fair lady Achilles bids you welcomeI had good argument for kissing onceBut that's no argument for kissing now For thus popp'd Paris in his hardiment And parted thus you and your argumentO deadly gall and theme of all our scorns For which we lose our heads to gild his hornsThe first was Menelaus' kiss this mineKisses her again Patroclus kisses youO this is trimParis and I kiss evermore for himI'll have my kiss sir Lady by your leaveIn kissing do you render or receiveBoth take and giveI'll make my match to live The kiss you take is better than you give Therefore no kissI'll give you boot I'll give you three for oneYou are an odd man give even or give noneAn odd man lady Every man is oddNo Paris is not for you know 'tis true That you are odd and he is even with youYou fillip me o' th' headNo I'll be swornIt were no match your nail against his horn May I sweet lady beg a

word I'll bring you to your father with A woman of quick senseFie fie upon her There's language in her eye her cheek her lip Nay her foot speaks her wanton spirits look out At every joint and motive of her body O these encounters so glib of tongue That give a coasting welcome ere it comes And wide unclasp the tables of their thoughts To every ticklish reader Set them down For sluttish spoils of opportunity And daughters of the game Trumpet withinThe Troyans' trumpet armedand other Trojans with attendantsYonder comes the troopHail all the state of Greece What shall be done To him that victory commands Or do you purpose A victor shall be known Will you the knights Shall to the edge of all extremity Pursue each other or shall they be divided By any voice or order of the field Hector bade askWhich way would Hector have itHe cares not he'll obey conditions'Tis done like Hector but securely done A little proudly and great deal misprizing The knight oppos'dIf not Achilles sir What is your nameIf not Achilles nothingTherefore Achilles But whate'er know this In the extremity of great and little Valour and pride excel themselves in Hector The one almost as infinite as all The other blank as nothing Weigh him well And that which looks like pride is courtesy This Ajax is half made of Hector's blood In love whereof half Hector stays at home Half heart half hand half Hector comes to seek This blended knight half Troyan and half GreekA maiden battle then O I perceive youRe Here is Sir Diomed Go gentle knight Stand by our Ajax As you and Lord Eneas Consent upon the order of their fight So be it either to the uttermost Or else a breath The combatants being kin Half stints their strife before their strokes begin andthe listsThey are oppos'd alreadyWhat Troyan is that same that looks so heavyThe youngest son of Priam a true knight Not yet mature yet matchless firm of word Speaking in deeds and deedless in his tongue Not soon provok'd nor being provok'd soon calm'd His heart and hand both open and both free For what he has he gives what thinks he shows Yet gives he not till judgment guide his bounty Nor dignifies an impair thought with breath Manly as Hector but more dangerous For Hector in his blaze of wrath subscribes To tender objects but he in heat of action Is more vindicative than jealous love They call him Troilus and on him erect A second hope as fairly built as Hector Thus says Aeneas one that knows the youth Even to his inches and with private soul Did in great Ilion thus translate him to me Alarum and fightThey are in actionNow Ajax hold thine ownHector thou sleep'st Awake theeHis blows are well dispos'd There AjaxTrumpets ceaseYou must no morePrinces enough so please youI am not warm yet let us fight againAs Hector pleasesWhy then will I no more Thou art great lord my father's sister's son A cousingerman to great Priam's seed The obligation of our blood forbids A gory emulation 'twixt us twain Were thy commixtion Greek and Troyan so That thou could'st say 'This hand is Grecian all And this is Troyan the sinews of this leg All Greek and this all Troy my mother's blood Runs on the dexter cheek and this sinister Bounds in my father's' by Jove multipotent Thou shouldst not bear from me a Greekish member Wherein my sword had not impressure made Of our rank feud but the just gods gainsay That any drop thou borrow'dst from thy mother My sacred aunt should by my mortal sword Be drained Let me embrace thee Ajax By him that thunders thou hast lusty arms Hector would have them fall upon him thus Cousin all honour to theeI thank thee Hector Thou art too gentle and too free a man I came to kill thee cousin and bear hence A great addition earned in thy deathNot Neoptolemus so mirable On whose bright crest Fame with her loud'st Oyes Cries 'This is he' could promise to himself A thought of added honour torn from HectorThere is expectance here from both the sides What further you will doWe'll answer it The issue is embracement Ajax farewellIf I might in entreaties find success As seld I have the chance I would desire My famous cousin to our Grecian tents'Tis Agamemnon's wish and great Achilles Doth long to see unarm'd the valiant HectorAeneas call my brother Troilus to me And signify this loving interview To the expecters of our Troyan part Desire them home Give me thy hand my cousin I will go eat with thee and see your knights and the rest of the Greeks come forwardGreat Agamemnon comes to meet us hereThe worthiest of them tell me name by name But for Achilles my own searching eyes Shall find him by his large and portly size Worthy all arms as welcome as to one That would be rid of such an enemy But that's no welcome Understand more clear What's past and what's to come is strew'd with husks And formless ruin of oblivion But in this extant moment faith and troth Strain'd purely from all hollow biasdrawing Bids thee with most divine integrity From heart of very heart great Hector welcomeI thank thee most imperious AgamemnonTo Troilus My wellfam'd lord of Troy no less to youLet me confirm my princely brother's greeting You brace of warlike brothers welcome hitherWho must we answerThe noble MenelausO you my lord By Mars his gauntlet thanks Mock not that I affect the untraded oath Your quondam wife swears still by Venus' glove She's well but bade me not commend her to youName her not now sir she's a deadly themeO pardon I offendI have thou gallant Troyan seen thee oft Labouring for destiny make cruel way Through ranks of Greekish youth and I have seen thee As hot as Perseus spur thy Phrygian steed Despising many forfeits and subduements When thou hast hung thy advanced sword i' th' air Not letting it decline on the declined That I have said to some my standersby 'Lo Jupiter is yonder dealing life' And I have seen thee pause and take thy breath When that a ring of Greeks have hemm'd thee in Like an Olympian wrestling This have I seen But this thy countenance still lock'd in steel I never saw till now I knew thy grandsire And once fought with him He was a soldier good But by great Mars the captain of us all Never like thee O let an old man embrace thee And worthy warrior welcome to our tents'Tis the old NestorLet me embrace thee good old chronicle That hast so long walk'd hand in hand with time Most reverend Nestor I am glad to clasp theeI would my arms could match thee in contention As they contend with thee in courtesyI would they couldHa By this white beard I'd fight with thee tomorrow Well welcome welcome I have seen the timeI wonder now how yonder city stands When we have here her base and pillar by usI know your favour Lord Ulysses well Ah sir there's many a Greek and Troyan dead Since first I saw yourself and Diomed In Ilion on your Greekish embassySir I foretold you then what would ensue My prophecy is but half his journey yet For yonder walls that pertly front your town Yond towers whose wanton tops do buss the clouds Must kiss their own feetI must not believe you There they stand yet and modestly I think The fall of every Phrygian stone will cost A drop of Grecian blood The end crowns all And that old common arbitrator Time Will one day end itSo to him we leave it Most gentle and most valiant Hector welcome After the General I beseech you next To feast with me and see me at my tentI shall forestall thee Lord Ulysses thou Now Hector I have fed mine eyes on thee I have with exact view perus'd thee Hector And quoted joint by jointIs this AchillesI am AchillesStand fair I pray thee let me look on theeBehold thy fillNay I have done alreadyThou art too brief I will the second time As I would buy thee view thee limb by limbO like a book of sport thou'lt read me o'er But there's more in me than thou understand'st Why dost thou so oppress me with thine eyeTell me you heavens in which part of his body Shall I destroy him Whether there or there or there That I may give the local wound a name And make distinct the very breach whereout Hector's great spirit flew Answer me heavensIt would discredit the blest gods proud man To answer such a question Stand again Think'st thou to catch my life so pleasantly As to prenominate in nice conjecture Where thou wilt hit me deadI tell thee yeaWert thou an oracle to tell me so I'd not believe thee Henceforth guard thee well For I'll not kill thee there nor there nor there But by the forge that stithied Mars his helm I'll kill thee everywhere yea o'er and o'er You wisest Grecians pardon me this brag His insolence draws folly from my lips But I'll endeavour deeds to match these words Or may I neverDo not chafe thee cousin And you Achilles let these threats alone Till accident or purpose bring you to't You may have every day enough of Hector If you have stomach The general state I fear Can scarce entreat you to be odd with himI pray you let us see you in the field We have had pelting wars since you refus'd The Grecians' causeDost thou entreat me Hector Tomorrow do I meet thee fell as death Tonight all friendsThy hand upon that matchFirst all you peers of Greece go to my tent There in the full convive we afterwards As Hector's leisure and your bounties shall Concur together severally entreat him Beat loud the tambourines let the trumpets blow That this great soldier may his welcome know all but and My Lord Ulysses tell me I beseech you In what place of the field doth Calchas keepAt Menelaus' tent most princely Troilus There Diomed doth feast with him tonight Who neither looks upon the heaven nor earth But gives all gaze and bent of amorous view On the fair CressidShall I sweet lord be bound to you so much After we part from Agamemnon's tent To bring me thitherYou shall command me sir As gentle tell me of what honour was This Cressida in Troy Had she no lover there That wails her absenceO sir to such as boasting show their scars A mock is due Will you walk on my lord She was belov'd she lov'd she is and doth But still sweet love is food for fortune's tooth
