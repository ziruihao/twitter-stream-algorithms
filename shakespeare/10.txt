The thing we sue forWe ignorant of ourselves Beg often our own harms which the wise pow'rs Deny us for our good so find we profit By losing of our prayersI shall do well The people love me and the sea is mine My powers are crescent and my auguring hope Says it will come to th' full Mark Antony In Egypt sits at dinner and will make No wars without doors Caesar gets money where He loses hearts Lepidus flatters both Of both is flatter'd but he neither loves Nor either cares for himCaesar and Lepidus Are in the field A mighty strength they carryWhere have you this 'Tis falseFrom Silvius sirHe dreams I know they are in Rome together Looking for Antony But all the charms of love Salt Cleopatra soften thy wan'd lip Let witchcraft join with beauty lust with both Tie up the libertine in a field of feasts Keep his brain fuming Epicurean cooks Sharpen with cloyless sauce his appetite That sleep and feeding may prorogue his honour Even till a Lethe'd dullnessHow now VarriusThis is most certain that I shall deliver Mark Antony is every hour in Rome Expected Since he went from Egypt 'tis A space for farther travelI could have given less matter A better ear Menas I did not think This amorous surfeiter would have donn'd his helm For such a petty war his soldiership Is twice the other twain But let us rear The higher our opinion that our stirring Can from the lap of Egypt's widow pluck The ne'erlustwearied AntonyI cannot hope Caesar and Antony shall well greet together His wife that's dead did trespasses to Caesar His brother warr'd upon him although I think Not mov'd by AntonyI know not Menas How lesser enmities may give way to greater Were't not that we stand up against them all 'Twere pregnant they should square between themselves For they have tained cause enough To draw their swords But how the fear of us May cement their divisions and bind up The petty difference we yet not know Be't as our gods will have't It only stands Our lives upon to use our strongest hands Come MenasRome The house of and Good Enobarbus 'tis a worthy deed And shall become you well to entreat your captain To soft and gentle speechI shall entreat him To answer like himself If Caesar move him Let Antony look over Caesar's head And speak as loud as Mars By Jupiter Were I the wearer of Antonius' beard I would not shave't today'Tis not a time For private stomachingEvery time Serves for the matter that is then born in'tBut small to greater matters must give wayNot if the small come firstYour speech is passion But pray you stir no embers up Here comes The noble Antonyand And yonder Caesarand If we compose well here to Parthia Hark VentidiusI do not know Maecenas Ask AgrippaNoble friends That which combin'd us was most great and let not A leaner action rend us What's amiss May it be gently heard When we debate Our trivial difference loud we do commit Murder in healing wounds Then noble partners The rather for I earnestly beseech Touch you the sourest points with sweetest terms Nor curstness grow to th' matter'Tis spoken well Were we before our arinies and to fight I should do thus FlourishWelcome to RomeThank youSitSit sirNay thenThey sitI learn you take things ill which are not so Or being concern you notI must be laugh'd at If or for nothing or a little Should say myself offended and with you Chiefly i' the world more laugh'd at that I should Once name you derogately when to sound your name It not concern'd meMy being in Egypt Caesar What was't to youNo more than my residing here at Rome Might be to you in Egypt Yet if you there Did practise on my state your being in Egypt Might be my questionHow intend you practis'dYou may be pleas'd to catch at mine intent By what did here befall me Your wife and brother Made wars upon me and their contestation Was theme for you you were the word of warYou do mistake your business my brother never Did urge me in his act I did inquire it And have my learning from some true reports That drew their swords with you Did he not rather Discredit my authority with yours And make the wars alike against my stomach Having alike your cause Of this my letters Before did satisfy you If you'll patch a quarrel As matter whole you have not to make it with It must not be with thisYou praise yourself By laying defects of judgment to me but You patch'd up your excusesNot so not so I know you could not lack I am certain on't Very necessity of this thought that I Your partner in the cause 'gainst which he fought Could not with graceful eyes attend those wars Which fronted mine own peace As for my wife I would you had her spirit in such another The third o' th' world is yours which with a snaffle You may pace easy but not such a wifeWould we had all such wives that the men might go to wars with the womenSo much uncurbable her garboils Caesar Made out of her impatience which not wanted Shrewdness of policy too I grieving grant Did you too much disquiet For that you must But say I could not help itI wrote to you When rioting in Alexandria you Did pocket up my letters and with taunts Did gibe my missive out of audienceSir He fell upon me ere admitted Then Three kings I had newly feasted and did want Of what I was i' th' morning but next day I told him of myself which was as much As to have ask'd him pardon Let this fellow Be nothing of our strife if we contend Out of our question wipe himYou have broken The article of your oath which you shall never Have tongue to charge me withSoft CaesarNo Lepidus let him speak The honour is sacred which he talks on now Supposing that I lack'd it But on Caesar The article of my oathTo lend me arms and aid when I requir'd them The which you both deniedNeglected rather And then when poisoned hours had bound me up From mine own knowledge As nearly as I may I'll play the penitent to you but mine honesty Shall not make poor my greatness nor my power Work without it Truth is that Fulvia To have me out of Egypt made wars here For which myself the ignorant motive do So far ask pardon as befits mine honour To stoop in such a case'Tis noble spokenIf it might please you to enforce no further The griefs between ye to forget them quite Were to remember that the present need Speaks to atone youWorthily spoken MaecenasOr if you borrow one another's love for the instant you may when you hear no more words of Pompey return it again You shall have time to wrangle in when you have nothing else to doThou art a soldier only Speak no moreThat truth should be silent I had almost forgotYou wrong this presence therefore speak no moreGo to then your considerate stoneI do not much dislike the matter but The manner of his speech for't cannot be We shall remain in friendship our conditions So diff'ring in their acts Yet if I knew What hoop should hold us stanch from edge to edge O' th' world I would pursue itGive me leave CaesarSpeak AgrippaThou hast a sister by the mother's side Admir'd Octavia Great Mark Antony Is now a widowerSay not so Agrippa If Cleopatra heard you your reproof Were well deserv'd of rashnessI am not married Caesar Let me hear Agrippa further speakTo hold you in perpetual amity To make you brothers and to knit your hearts With an unslipping knot take Antony Octavia to his wife whose beauty claims No worse a husband than the best of men Whose virtue and whose general graces speak That which none else can utter By this marriage All little jealousies which now seem great And all great fears which now import their dangers Would then be nothing Truths would be tales Where now half tales be truths Her love to both Would each to other and all loves to both Draw after her Pardon what I have spoke For 'tis a studied not a present thought By duty ruminatedWill Caesar speakNot till he hears how Antony is touch'd With what is spoke alreadyWhat power is in Agrippa If I would say 'Agrippa be it so' To make this goodThe power of Caesar and His power unto OctaviaMay I never To this good purpose that so fairly shows Dream of impediment Let me have thy hand Further this act of grace and from this hour The heart of brothers govern in our loves And sway our great designsThere is my hand A sister I bequeath you whom no brother Did ever love so dearly Let her live To join our kingdoms and our hearts and never Fly off our loves againHappily amenI did not think to draw my sword 'gainst Pompey For he hath laid strange courtesies and great Of late upon me I must thank him only Lest my remembrance suffer ill report At heel of that defy himTime calls upon's Of us must Pompey presently be sought Or else he seeks out usWhere lies heAbout the Mount MisenumWhat is his strength by landGreat and increasing but by sea He is an absolute masterSo is the fame Would we had spoke together Haste we for it Yet ere we put ourselves in arms dispatch we The business we have talk'd ofWith most gladness And do invite you to my sister's view Whither straight I'll lead youLet us Lepidus Not lack your companyNoble Antony Not sickness should detain meFlourish all but Welcome from Egypt sirHalf the heart of Caesar worthy Maecenas My honourable friend AgrippaGood EnobarbusWe have cause to be glad that matters are so well digested You stay'd well by't in EgyptAy sir we did sleep day out of countenance and made the night light with drinkingEight wild boars roasted whole at a breakfast and but twelve persons there Is this trueThis was but as a fly by an eagle We had much more monstrous matter of feast which worthily deserved notingShe's a most triumphant lady if report be square to herWhen she first met Mark Antony she purs'd up his heart upon the river of CydnusThere she appear'd indeed Or my reporter devis'd well for herI will tell you The barge she sat in like a burnish'd throne Burn'd on the water The poop was beaten gold Purple the sails and so perfumed that The winds were lovesick with them the oars were silver Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke and made The water which they beat to follow faster As amorous of their strokes For her own person It beggar'd all description She did lie In her pavilion clothofgold of tissue O'erpicturing that Venus where we see The fancy outwork nature On each side her Stood pretty dimpled boys like smiling Cupids With diverscolour'd fans whose wind did seem To glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool And what they undid didO rare for AntonyHer gentlewomen like the Nereides So many mermaids tended her i' th' eyes And made their bends adornings At the helm A seeming mermaid steers The silken tackle Swell with the touches of those flowersoft hands That yarely frame the office From the barge A strange invisible perfume hits the sense Of the adjacent wharfs The city cast Her people out upon her and Antony Enthron'd i' th' marketplace did sit alone Whistling to th' air which but for vacancy Had gone to gaze on Cleopatra too And made a gap in natureRare EgyptianUpon her landing Antony sent to her Invited her to supper She replied It should be better he became her guest Which she entreated Our courteous Antony Whom ne'er the word of 'No' woman heard speak Being barber'd ten times o'er goes to the feast And for his ordinary pays his heart For what his eyes eat onlyRoyal wench She made great Caesar lay his sword to bed He ploughed her and she cropp'dI saw her once Hop forty paces through the public street And having lost her breath she spoke and panted That she did make defect perfection And breathless pow'r breathe forthNow Antony must leave her utterlyNever He will not Age cannot wither her nor custom stale Her infinite variety Other women cloy The appetites they feed but she makes hungry Where most she satisfies for vilest things Become themselves in her that the holy priests Bless her when she is riggishIf beauty wisdom modesty can settle The heart of Antony Octavia is A blessed lottery to himLet us go Good Enobarbus make yourself my guest Whilst you abide hereHumbly sir I thank

natural luck He beats thee 'gainst the odds Thy lustre thickens When he shines by I say again thy spirit Is all afraid to govern thee near him But he away 'tis nobleGet thee gone Say to Ventidius I would speak with himHe shall to Parthia Be it art or hap He hath spoken true The very dice obey him And in our sports my better cunning faints Under his chance If we draw lots he speeds His cocks do

for him What was't That mov'd pale Cassius to conspire and what Made the allhonour'd honest Roman Brutus With the arm'd rest courtiers of beauteous freedom To drench the Capitol but that they would Have one man but a man And that is it Hath made me rig my navy at whose burden The anger'd ocean foams with which I meant To scourge th' ingratitude that despiteful Rome Cast on my noble fatherTake

now the wife of Marcus AntoniusPray ye sir'Tis trueThen is Caesar and he for ever knit togetherIf I were bound to divine of this unity I would not prophesy soI think the policy of that purpose made more in the marriage than the love of the partiesI think so too But you shall find the band that seems to tie their friendship together will be the very strangler of their amity Octavia is of a holy cold and still conversationWho would not have his wife soNot he that himself is not so which is Mark Antony He will to his Egyptian dish again then shall the sighs of Octavia blow the fire up in Caesar and as I said before that which is the strength of their amity shall prove the immediate author of their variance Antony will use his affection where it is he married but his occasion hereAnd

And answer me declin'd sword against sword Ourselves alone I'll write it Follow meAside Yes like enough highbattled Caesar will Unstate his happiness and be stag'd to th' show Against a sworder I see

please our master Will leap to be his friend For us you know Whose he is we are and that is Caesar'sSo Thus then thou most renown'd Caesar entreats Not to consider in what case thou stand'st Further

deserv'dHe is a god and knows What is most right Mine honour was not yielded But conquer'd merelyAside To be sure of that I will ask Antony Sir sir thou art so leaky That we must leave thee to thy sinking for Thy dearest quit theeShall I say to Caesar What you require of him For he partly begs To be desir'd to give It much would please him That of his fortunes you should make a staff To lean upon But it would warm his spirits To hear from me you had left Antony And put yourself under his shroud The universal landlordWhat's your nameMy name is ThyreusMost kind messenger Say to great Caesar this in deputation I kiss his conquring hand Tell him I am prompt To lay my crown at 's feet and there to kneel Tell him from his allobeying breath I hear The doom of Egypt'Tis your noblest course

say He makes me angry with him for he seems Proud and disdainful harping on what I am Not what he knew I was He makes me angry And at this time most easy 'tis to do't When my good stars that were my former guides Have empty left their orbs and shot their fires Into th' abysm of hell If he mislike My speech and what is done tell him he has Hipparchus my enfranched bondman whom He may at pleasure whip or hang or torture As he shall like to quit me Urge it thou Hence with thy stripes be gone Have you done yetAlack our terrene moon Is now eclips'd and it portends alone The fall of AntonyI must stay his timeTo flatter Caesar would you mingle eyes With one that ties his pointsNot know me yetColdhearted toward meAh dear if I be so From my cold heart let heaven engender hail And poison it in the source and the first stone Drop in my neck as it determines so Dissolve my life The next Caesarion smite Till by degrees the memory of my womb Together with my brave Egyptians all By the discandying of this pelleted storm Lie graveless till the flies and gnats of Nile Have buried them for preyI am satisfied Caesar sits down in Alexandria where I will oppose his fate Our force by land

pestilent scytheall but Now he'll outstare the lightning To be furious Is to be frighted out of fear and in that mood The dove will peck the estridge and I see still A diminution in our captain's

wore my life To spend upon his haters If thou please To take me to thee as I was to him I'll be to Caesar if thou pleasest not I yield thee up my lifeWhat is't thou say'stI say O Caesar Antony is deadThe breaking of so great a thing should make A greater crack The round world Should have shook lions into civil streets And citizens to their dens The death of Antony Is not a single doom in the name lay A moiety of the worldHe is dead Caesar Not by a public minister of justice Nor by a hired knife but that self hand Which writ his honour in the acts it did Hath with the courage which the heart did lend it Splitted the heart This is his sword I robb'd his wound of it behold it stain'd With his most noble bloodLook you sad friends The gods rebuke me but it is tidings To wash the eyes of kingsAnd strange it is That nature must compel us to lament Our most persisted deedsHis taints and honours Wag'd equal with himA rarer spirit never Did steer humanity But you gods will give us Some faults to make us men Caesar is touch'dWhen such a spacious mirror's set before him He needs must see himselfO Antony I have follow'd thee to this But we do lance Diseases in our bodies I must perforce Have shown to thee such a declining day Or look on thine we could not stall together In the whole world But yet let me lament With tears as sovereign as the blood of hearts That thou my brother my competitor In top of all design my mate in empire Friend and companion in the front of war The arm of mine own body and the heart Where mine his thoughts did kindle that our stars Unreconciliable should divide Our equalness to this Hear me good friendsanBut I will tell you at some meeter season The business of this man looks out of him We'll hear him what he says Whence are

heart She soon shall know of us by some of ours How honourable and how kindly we Determine for her for Caesar cannot learn To be ungentleSo the gods preserve theeCome hither Proculeius Go and say We

this Alexandria The monument and My desolation does begin to make A better life 'Tis paltry to be Caesar Not being Fortune he's but Fortune's knave A minister of her will and it is great To do that thing that ends all other deeds Which shackles accidents and bolts up change Which sleeps and never palates more the dug The beggar's nurse and Caesar's to the gates of the monument and soldiersCaesar sends greetings to the Queen of Egypt And bids thee study on what fair demands Thou mean'st to have him grant theeWhat's thy nameMy name is ProculeiusAntony Did tell me of you bade me trust you but I do not greatly care to be deceiv'd That have no use for trusting If your master Would have a queen his beggar you must tell him That majesty to keep decorum must No less beg than a kingdom If he please To give me conquer'd Egypt for my son He gives me so much of mine own as I Will kneel to him with thanksBe of good cheer Y'are fall'n into a princely hand fear nothing Make your full reference freely to my lord Who is so full of grace that it flows over On all that need Let me report to him Your sweet dependency and you shall find A conqueror that will pray in aid for kindness Where he for

please yeHis face was as the heav'ns and therein stuck A sun and moon which kept their course and lighted The little O the earthMost sovereign creatureHis legs bestrid the ocean his rear'd arm Crested the world His voice was propertied As all the tuned spheres and that to friends But when he meant to quail and shake the orb He was as rattling thunder For his bounty There was no winter in't an autumn 'twas That grew the more by reaping His delights Were dolphinlike they show'd his back above The element they liv'd in In his livery Walk'd crowns and crownets realms and islands were As plates dropp'd from his pocketCleopatraThink you there was or might be such a man As this I dreamt ofGentle madam noYou lie up to the hearing of the gods But if there be nor ever were one such It's past the size of drearning Nature wants stuff To vie strange forms with fancy yet t' imagine An Antony were nature's piece 'gainst fancy Condemning shadows quiteHear me good madam Your loss is as yourself great and you bear it As answering to the weight Would I might never O'ertake pursu'd success but I do feel By the rebound of yours a grief that smites My very heart at rootI thank you sir Know you

cause so well To make it clear but do confess I have Been laden with like frailties which before Have often sham'd our sexCleopatra know We will extenuate rather than enforce If you apply yourself to our intents Which towards you are most gentle you shall find A benefit in this change but if you seek To lay on me a cruelty by taking Antony's course you shall bereave yourself Of my good purposes and put your children To that destruction which I'll guard them from If thereon you rely I'll take my leaveAnd may through all the world 'Tis yours and we Your scutcheons and your signs of conquest

I warrant thee but I'll catch thine eyes Though they had wings Slave soulless villain dog O rarely baseGood Queen let us entreat youO Caesar what a wounding shame is this That thou vouchsafing here to visit me Doing the honour of thy lordliness To one so meek that mine own servant should Parcel the sum of my disgraces by Addition of his envy Say good Caesar That I some lady trifles have reserv'd Immoment toys things of such dignity As we greet modern friends withal and say Some nobler token I have kept apart For Livia and Octavia to induce Their mediation must I be unfolded With one that I have bred The gods It smites me Beneath the fall I have ToPrithee go hence Or I shall show the cinders of my spirits Through th' ashes of my chance Wert thou a man Thou wouldst have mercy on meForbear

doneBravest at the last She levell'd at our purposes and being royal Took her own way The manner of their deaths I do not see them bleedWho was last with themA simple countryman that brought her figs This was his basketPoison'd thenO Caesar This Charmian liv'd but now she stood and spake I found her trimming up the diadem On her dead mistress Tremblingly she stood And on the sudden dropp'dO noble weakness If they had swallow'd poison 'twould appear By external swelling but she looks like sleep As she would catch another Antony In her strong toil of graceHere on her breast There is a vent of blood and something blown The like is on her armThis is an aspic's trail and these figleaves Have slime upon them such as th' aspic leaves Upon the caves of NileMost probable That so she died for her physician tells me She hath pursu'd conclusions infinite Of easy ways to die Take up her bed And bear her women from the monument She shall be buried by her Antony No grave upon the earth shall clip in it A pair so famous High events as these Strike those that make them and their story is No less in pity than his glory which Brought them to be lamented Our army shall In solemn show attend this funeral And then to Rome Come Dolabella see High order in this great solemnity
