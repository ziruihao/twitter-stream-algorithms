London A street leading to the Towerthewith her attendantsThis way the King will come this is the way To Julius Caesar's illerected tower To whose flint bosom my condemned lord Is doom'd a prisoner by proud Bolingbroke Here let us rest if this rebellious earth Have any resting for her true King's queenand Guard But soft but see or rather do not see My fair rose wither Yet look up behold That you in pity may dissolve to dew And wash him fresh again with truelove tears Ah thou the model where old Troy did stand Thou map of honour thou King Richard's tomb And not King Richard thou most beauteous inn Why should hardfavour'd grief be lodg'd in thee When triumph is become an alehouse guestJoin not with grief fair woman do not so To make my end too sudden Learn good soul To think our former state a happy dream From which awak'd the truth of what we are Shows us but this I am sworn brother sweet To grim Necessity and he and Will keep a league till death Hie thee to France And cloister thee in some religious house Our holy lives must win a new world's crown Which our profane hours here have thrown downWhat is my Richard both in shape and mind Transform'd and weak'ned Hath Bolingbroke depos'd Thine intellect Hath he been in thy heart The lion dying thrusteth forth his paw And wounds the earth if nothing else with rage To be o'erpow'r'd and wilt thou pupillike Take the correction mildly kiss the rod And fawn on rage with base humility Which art a lion and the king of beastsA king of beasts indeed If aught but beasts I had been still a happy king of men Good sometimes queen prepare thee hence for France Think I am dead and that even here thou takest As from my deathbed thy last living leave In winter's tedious nights sit by the fire With good old folks and let them tell thee tales Of woeful ages long ago betid And ere thou bid good night to quit their griefs Tell thou the lamentable tale of me And send the hearers weeping to their beds For why the senseless brands will sympathize The heavy accent of thy moving tongue And in compassion weep the fire out And some will mourn in ashes some coalblack For the deposing of a rightful king attendedMy lord the mind of Bolingbroke is chang'd You must to Pomfret not unto the Tower And madam there is order ta'en for you With all swift speed you must away to FranceNorthumberland thou ladder wherewithal The mounting Bolingbroke ascends my throne The time shall not be many hours of age More than it is ere foul sin gathering head Shall break into corruption Thou shalt think Though he divide the realm and give thee half It is too little helping him to all And he shall think that thou which knowest the way To plant unrightful kings wilt know again Being ne'er so little urg'd another way To pluck him headlong from the usurped throne The love of wicked men converts to fear That fear to hate and hate turns one or both To worthy danger and deserved deathMy guilt be on my head and there an end Take leave and part for you must part forthwithDoubly divorc'd Bad men you violate A twofold marriage'twixt my crown and me And then betwixt me and my married wife Let me unkiss the oath 'twixt thee and me And yet not so for with a kiss 'twas made Part us Northumberland I towards the north Where shivering cold and sickness pines the clime My wife to France from whence set forth in pomp She came adorned hither like sweet May Sent back like Hallowmas or short'st of dayAnd must we be divided Must we partAy hand from hand my love and heart from heartBanish us both and send the King with meThat were some love but little policyThen whither he goes thither let me goSo two together weeping make one woe Weep thou for me in France I for thee here Better far off than near be ne'er the near Go count thy way with sighs I mine with groansSo longest way shall have the longest moansTwice for one step I'll groan the way being short And piece the way out with a heavy heart Come come in wooing sorrow let's be brief Since wedding it there is such length in grief One kiss shall stop our mouths and dumbly part Thus give I mine and thus take I thy heartGive me mine own again 'twere no good part To take on me to keep and kill thy heart So now I have mine own again be gone That I may strive to kill it with a groanWe make woe wanton with this fond delay Once more adieu the rest let sorrow say The's palacetheand the My Lord you told me you would tell the rest When weeping made you break the story off Of our two cousins' coming into LondonWhere did I leaveAt that sad stop my lord Where rude misgoverned hands from windows' tops Threw dust and rubbish on King Richard's headThen as I said the Duke great Bolingbroke Mounted upon a hot and fiery steed Which his aspiring rider seem'd to know With slow but stately pace kept on his course Whilst all tongues cried 'God save thee Bolingbroke' You would have thought the very windows spake So many greedy looks of young and old Through casements darted their desiring eyes Upon his visage and that all the walls With painted imagery had said at once 'Jesu preserve thee Welcome Bolingbroke' Whilst he from the one side to the other turning Bareheaded lower than his proud steed's neck Bespake them thus 'I thank you countrymen' And thus still doing thus he pass'd alongAlack poor Richard where rode he the whilstAs in a theatre the eyes of men After a wellgrac'd actor leaves the stage Are idly bent on him that s next Thinking his prattle to be tedious Even so or with much more contempt men's eyes Did scowl on gentle Richard no man cried 'God save him' No joyful tongue gave him his welcome home But dust was thrown upon his sacred head Which with such gentle sorrow he shook off His face still combating with tears and smiles The badges of his grief and patience That had not God for some strong purpose steel'd The hearts of men they must perforce have melted And barbarism itself have pitied him But heaven hath a hand in these events To whose high will we bound our calm contents To Bolingbroke are we sworn subjects now Whose state and honour I for aye allowHere comes my son AumerleAumerle that was But that is lost for being Richard's friend And madam you must call him Rudand now I am in Parliament pledge for his truth And lasting fealty to the newmade kingWelcome my son Who are the violets now That strew the green lap of the new come

I would to God my lords he might be found Inquire at London 'mongst the taverns there For there they say he daily doth frequent With unrestrained loose companions Even such they say as stand in narrow lanes And beat our watch and rob our passengers Which he young wanton and effeminate boy Takes on the point of honour to support So dissolute a crewMy lord some two days since I saw the Prince And told him of those triumphs held at OxfordAnd what said the gallantHis answer was he would unto the stews And from the common'st creature pluck a glove And wear it as a favour and with that He would unhorse the lustiest challengerAs dissolute as desperate yet through both I see some sparks of better hope which elder years May happily bring forth But who comes hereamazedWhere is the KingWhat means

villain ere thy hand did set it down I tore it from the traitor's bosom King Fear and not love begets his penitence Forget to pity him lest thy pity prove A serpent that will sting thee to the heartO heinous strong and bold conspiracy O loyal father of a treacherous son Thou sheer immaculate and silver fountain From whence this stream through muddy passages Hath held his current and defil'd himself Thy overflow of good converts to bad And thy abundant goodness shall excuse This deadly blot in thy digressing sonSo shall my virtue be his vice's bawd And he shall spend mine honour with his

mother's prayers I bend my kneeKneelsAgainst them both my true joints bended beKneels Ill mayst thou thrive if thou grant any gracePleads he in earnest Look upon his face His eyes do drop no tears his prayers are in jest His words come from his mouth ours from our breast He prays but faintly and would be denied We pray with heart and soul and all beside His weary joints would gladly rise I know Our knees still kneel till to the ground they grow His prayers are full of false hypocrisy Ours of true zeal and deep integrity Our prayers do outpray his then let them have That mercy which true prayer ought to haveGood aunt stand updo not say 'stand up' Say 'pardon' first and afterwards 'stand up' An if I were thy nurse thy tongue to teach 'Pardon' should be the first word of thy speech I never long'd to hear a word till now Say 'pardon' King let pity teach thee how The word is short but not so short as sweet No word like 'pardon' for kings' mouths so meetSpeak it in French King say 'pardonne moy'Dost thou teach pardon pardon to destroy Ah my sour husband my hardhearted lord That sets the word itself against the word Speak 'pardon' as 'tis current in our land The chopping French we do not understand Thine eye begins to speak set thy tongue there Or in thy piteous heart plant thou thine ear That hearing how our plaints and prayers do pierce Pity may move thee 'pardon' to rehearseGood aunt stand upI do not sue to stand Pardon is all the suit I have in handI pardon him as God shall pardon meO happy vantage of a kneeling knee Yet am I sick for fear Speak it again Twice saying 'pardon' doth not pardon twain But makes one pardon strongWith all my heart I pardon himA god on earth thou artBut for our trusty brotherinlaw and the Abbot With all the rest of that consorted crew Destruction straight shall dog them at the heels Good uncle help to order several powers To Oxford or where'er these traitors are They shall not live within this world I swear But I will have them if I once know where Uncle farewell and cousin adieu Your mother well hath pray'd and prove you trueCome my old son I pray God make thee new Windsor Castle and a servantDidst thou not mark the King what words he spake 'Have I no friend will rid me of this living fear' Was it not soThese were his very words'Have I no friend' quoth he He spake it twice And urg'd it twice together did he notHe didAnd speaking it he wishtly look'd on me As who should say 'I would thou wert the man That would divorce this terror from my heart' Meaning the King at Pomfret Come let's go I am the King's friend and will rid his foePomfret Castle The dungeon of the CastleI have been studying how I may compare This prison where I live unto the world And for because the world is populous And here is not a creature but myself I cannot do it Yet I'll hammer it out My brain I'll prove the female to my soul My soul the father and these two beget A generation of stillbreeding thoughts And these same thoughts people this little world In humours like the people of this world For no thought is contented The better sort As thoughts of things divine are intermix'd With scruples and do set the word itself Against the word As thus 'Come little ones' and then again 'It is as hard to come as for a camel To thread the postern of a small needle's eye' Thoughts tending to ambition they do plot Unlikely wonders how these vain weak nails May tear a passage through the flinty ribs Of this hard world my ragged prison walls And for they cannot die in their own pride Thoughts tending to content flatter themselves That they are not the first of fortune's slaves Nor shall not be the last like silly beggars Who sitting in the stocks refuge their shame That many have and others must sit there And in this thought they find a kind of ease Bearing their own misfortunes on the back Of such as have before endur'd the like Thus play I in one person many people And none contented Sometimes am I king Then treasons make me wish myself a beggar And so I am Then crushing penury Persuades me I was better when a king Then am I king'd again and by and by Think that I am unking'd by Bolingbroke And straight am nothing But whate'er I be Nor I nor any man that but man is With nothing shall be pleas'd till he be eas'd With being nothingThe music plays Music do I hear Ha ha keep time How sour sweet music is When time is broke and no proportion kept So is it in the music of men's lives And here have I the daintiness of ear To check time broke in a disorder'd string But for the concord of my state and time Had not an ear to hear my true time broke I wasted time and now doth time waste me For now hath time made me his numb'ring clock My thoughts are minutes and with sighs they jar Their watches on unto mine eyes the outward watch Whereto my finger like a dial's point Is pointing still in cleansing them from tears Now sir the sound that tells what hour it is Are clamorous groans which strike upon my heart Which is the bell So sighs and tears and groans Show minutes times and hours but my time Runs posting on in Bolingbroke's proud joy While I stand fooling here his Jack of the clock This music mads me Let it sound no more For though it have holp madmen to their wits In me it seems it will make wise men mad Yet blessing on his heart that gives it me For 'tis a sign of love and love to Richard Is a strange brooch in this allhating worlda of the stableHail royal PrinceThanks noble peer The cheapest of us is ten groats too dear What art thou and how comest thou hither Where no man never comes but that sad dog That brings me food to make misfortune liveI was a poor groom of thy stable King When thou wert king who travelling towards York With much ado at length have gotten leave To look upon my sometimes royal master's face O how it ern'd my heart when I beheld In London streets that coronationday When Bolingbroke rode on roan Barbary That horse that thou so often hast bestrid That horse that I so carefully have dress'dRode he on Barbary Tell me gentle friend How went he under himSo proudly as if he disdain'd the groundSo proud that Bolingbroke was on his back That jade hath eat bread from my royal hand This hand hath made him proud with clapping him Would he not stumble would he not fall down Since pride must have a fall and break the neck Of that proud man that did usurp his back Forgiveness horse Why do I rail on thee Since thou created to be aw'd by man Wast born to bear I was not made a horse And yet I bear a burden like an ass Spurr'd gall'd and tir'd by jauncing Bolingbrokewith meatFellow give place here is no longer stayIf thou love me 'tis time thou wert awaymy tongue dares not that my heart shall sayMy lord will't please you to fall toTaste of it first as thou art wont to doMy lord I dare not Sir Pierce of Exton Who lately came from the King commands the contraryThe devil take Henry of Lancaster and thee Patience is stale and I am weary of itBeats the Help help help The murderers and servants rush in armedHow now What means death in this rude assault Villain thy own hand yields thy death's instrumentSnatching a weapon and killing one Go thou and fill another room in hell He kills another then strikes him down That hand shall burn in neverquenching fire That staggers thus my person Exton thy fierce hand Hath with the King's blood stain'd the King's own land Mount mount my soul thy seat is up on high Whilst my gross flesh sinks downward here to dieDiesAs full of valour as of royal blood Both have I spill'd O would the deed were good For now the devil that told me I did well Says that this deed is chronicled in hell This dead King to the living King I'll bear Take hence the rest and give them burial hereWindsor Castle Flourish the With otherand attendantsKind uncle York the latest news we hear Is that the rebels have consum'd with fire Our town of Ciceter in Gloucestershire But whether they be ta'en or slain we hear not Welcome my lord What is the newsFirst to thy sacred state wish I all happiness The next news is I have to London sent The heads of Salisbury Spencer Blunt and Kent The manner of their taking may appear At large discoursed in this paper hereWe thank thee gentle Percy for thy pains And to thy worth will add right worthy gainsMy lord I have from Oxford sent to London The heads of Brocas and Sir Bennet Seely Two of the dangerous consorted traitors That sought at Oxford thy dire overthrowThy pains Fitzwater shall not be forgot Right noble is thy merit well I wotWith theThe grand conspirator Abbot of Westminster With clog of conscience and sour melancholy Hath yielded up his body to the grave But here is Carlisle living to abide Thy kingly doom and sentence of his prideCarlisle this is your doom Choose out some secret place some reverend room More than thou hast and with it joy thy life So as thou liv'st in peace die free from strife For though mine enemy thou hast ever been High sparks of honour in thee have I seen with attendants hearing a coffinGreat King within this coffin I present Thy buried fear Herein all breathless lies The mightiest of thy greatest enemies Richard of Bordeaux by me hither broughtExton I thank thee not for thou hast wrought A deed of slander with thy fatal hand Upon my head and all this famous landFrom your own mouth my lord did I this deedThey love not poison that do poison need Nor do I thee Though I did wish him dead I hate the murderer love him murdered The guilt of conscience take thou for thy labour But neither my good word nor princely favour With Cain go wander thorough shades of night And never show thy head by day nor light Lords I protest my soul is full of woe That blood should sprinkle me to make me grow Come mourn with me for what I do lament And put on sullen black incontinent I'll make a voyage to the Holy Land To wash this blood off from my guilty hand March sadly after grace my mournings here In weeping after this untimely bier
