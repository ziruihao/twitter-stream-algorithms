FlourishNow all the youth of England are on fire And silken dalliance in the wardrobe lies Now thrive the armourers and honour's thought Reigns solely in the breast of every man They sell the pasture now to buy the horse Following the mirror of all Christian kings With winged heels as English Mercuries For now sits Expectation in the air And hides a sword from hilts unto the point With crowns imperial crowns and coronets Promis'd to Harry and his followers The French advis'd by good intelligence Of this most dreadful preparation Shake in their fear and with pale policy Seek to divert the English purposes O England model to thy inward greatness Like little body with a mighty heart What mightst thou do that honour would thee do Were all thy children kind and natural But see thy fault France hath in thee found out A nest of hollow bosoms which he fills With treacherous crowns and three corrupted men One Richard Earl of Cambridge and the second Henry Lord Scroop of Masham and the third Sir Thomas Grey knight of Northumberland Have for the gilt of France O guilt indeed Confirm'd conspiracy with fearful France And by their hands this grace of kings must die If hell and treason

a foreign purse so sell His sovereign's life to death and treacheryTrumpets soundthe and attendantsNow sits the wind fair and we will aboard My Lord of Cambridge and my kind Lord of Masham And you my gentle knight give me your thoughts Think you not that the pow'rs we bear with us Will cut their passage through the force of France Doing the execution and the act For which we have in head assembled themNo doubt my liege if each man do his bestI doubt not that since we are well persuaded We carry not a heart with us from hence That grows not in a fair consent with ours Nor leave not one behind that doth not wish Success and conquest to attend on usNever was monarch better fear'd and lov'd Than is your Majesty There's not I think a subject That sits in heartgrief and uneasines Under the sweet shade of your governmentTrue those that were your father's enemies Have steep'd their galls in honey and do serve you With hearts create of duty and of zealWe therefore have great cause of thankfulness And shall forget the office of our hand Sooner than quittance of desert and merit According to the weight and worthinessSo service shall with steeled sinews toil And labour shall refresh itself with hope To do your Grace incessant servicesWe judge no less Uncle of Exeter Enlarge the man committed yesterday That rail'd against our person We consider It was excess of wine that set him on And on his more advice we pardon himThat's mercy but too much security Let him be punish'd sovereign lest example Breed by his sufferance more of such a kindO let us yet be mercifulSo may your Highness and yet punish tooSir You show great mercy if you give him life After the taste of much correctionAlas your too much love and care of me Are heavy orisons 'gainst this poor wretch If little faults proceeding on distemper Shall not be wink'd at how shall we stretch our eye When capital crimes chew'd swallow'd and digested Appear before us We'll yet enlarge that man Though Cambridge Scroop and Grey in their dear care And tender preservation of our person Would have him punish'd And now to our French causes Who are the late commissionersI one my lord Your Highness bade me ask for it todaySo did you me my liegeAnd I my royal sovereignThen Richard Earl of Cambridge there is yours There yours Lord Scroop of Masham and Sir Knight Grey of Northumberland this same is yours Read them and know I know your worthiness My Lord of Westmoreland and uncle Exeter We will aboard tonight Why how now gentlemen What see you in those papers that you lose So much complexion Look ye how they change Their cheeks are paper Why what read you there That have so cowarded and chas'd your blood Out of appearanceI do confess my fault And do submit me to your Highness' mercy To which we all appealThe mercy that was quick in us but lateBy your own counsel is suppress'd and kill'd You must not dare for shame to talk of mercy For your own reasons turn into your bosoms As dogs upon their masters worrying you See you my princes and my noble peers These English monsters My Lord of Cambridge here You know how apt our love was to accord To furnish him with an appertinents Belonging to his honour and this man Hath for a few light crowns lightly conspir'd And sworn unto the practices of France To kill us here in Hampton to the which This knight no less for bounty bound to us Than Cambridge is hath likewise sworn But O What shall I say to thee Lord Scroop thou cruel Ingrateful savage and inhuman creature Thou that didst bear the key of all my counsels That knew'st the very bottom of my soul That almost mightst have coin'd me into gold Wouldst thou have practis'd on me for thy use May it be possible that foreign hire Could out of thee extract one spark of evil That might annoy my finger 'Tis so strange That though the truth of it stands off as gross As black and white my eye will scarcely see it Treason and murder ever kept together As two yokedevils sworn to either's purpose Working so grossly in a natural cause That admiration did not whoop at them But thou 'gainst all proportion didst bring in Wonder to wait on treason and on murder And whatsoever cunning fiend it was That wrought upon thee so preposterously Hath got the voice in hell for excellence And other devils that suggest by treasons Do botch and bungle up damnation With patches colours and with forms being fetch'd From glist'ring semblances of piety But he that temper'd thee bade thee stand up Gave thee no instance why thou shouldst do treason Unless to dub thee with the name of traitor If that same demon that hath gull'd thee thus Should with his lion gait walk the whole world He might return to vasty Tartar back And tell the legions 'I can never win A soul so easy as that Englishman's' O how hast thou with jealousy infected The sweetness of affiance Show men dutiful Why so didst thou Seem they grave and learned Why so didst thou Come they of noble family Why so didst thou Seem they religious Why so didst thou Or are they spare in diet Free from gross passion or of mirth or anger Constant in spirit not swerving with the blood Garnish'd and deck'd in modest complement Not working with the eye without the ear And but in purged judgment trusting neither Such and so finely bolted didst thou seem And thus thy fall hath left a kind of blot To mark the fullfraught man and best indued With some suspicion I will weep for thee For this revolt of thine methinks is like Another fall of man Their faults are open Arrest them to the answer of the law And God acquit them of their practicesI arrest thee of high treason by the name of Richard Earl of Cambridge I arrest thee of high treason by the name of Henry Lord Scroop of Masham I arrest thee of high treason by the name of Thomas Grey knight of NorthumberlandOur purposes God justly hath discover'd And I repent my fault more than my death Which I beseech your Highness to forgive Although my body pay the price of itFor me the gold of France did not seduce Although I did admit it as a motive The sooner to effect what I intended But God be thanked for prevention Which I in sufferance heartily will rejoice Beseeching God and you to pardon meNever did faithful subject more rejoice At the discovery of most dangerous treason Than I do at this hour joy o'er myself Prevented from a damned prise My fault but not my body pardon sovereignGod quit you in his mercy Hear your sentence You have conspir'd against our royal person Join'd with an enemy proclaim'd and from his coffers Receiv'd the golden earnest of our death Wherein you would have sold your king to slaughter His princes and his peers to servitude His subjects to oppression and contempt And his whole kingdom into desolation Touching our person seek we no revenge But we our kingdom's safety must so tender Whose ruin you have sought that to her laws We do deliver you Get you therefore hence Poor miserable wretches to your death The taste whereof God of his mercy give You patience to endure and true repentance Of all your dear offences Bear them hence andguarded Now lords for France the prise whereof Shall be to you as us like glorious We doubt not of a fair and lucky war Since God so graciously hath brought to light This dangerous treason lurking in our way To hinder our beginnings we doubt not now But every rub is smoothed on our way Then forth dear countrymen let us deliver Our puissance into the hand of God Putting it straight in expedition Cheerly to sea the signs of war advance No king of England if not king of France Flourish

Arthur's bosom 'A made a finer end and went away an it had been any christom child 'a parted ev'n just between twelve and one ev'n at the turning o' th' tide for after I saw him fumble with the sheets and play with flowers and smile upon his fingers' end I knew there was but one way for his nose was as sharp as a pen and 'a babbl'd of green fields 'How now Sir John' quoth I 'What man be o' good cheer' So 'a cried out 'God God God' three or four times Now I to comfort him bid him 'a should not think of God I hop'd there was no need to trouble himself with any such thoughts yet So 'a bade me lay more clothes on his feet I put my hand into the bed and felt them and they were as cold as any stone then I felt to his knees and so upward and upward and all was as cold as any stoneThey say he

Of Brabant and of Orleans shall make forth And you Prince Dauphin with all swift dispatch To line and new repair our towns of war With men of courage and with means defendant For England his approaches makes as fierce As waters to the sucking of a gulf It fits us then to be as provident As fear may teach us out of late examples Left by the fatal and neglected English Upon our fieldsMy most redoubted father It is most meet we arm us 'gainst the foe For peace itself should not so dull a kingdom Though war nor no known quarrel were in question But that defences musters preparations Should be maintain'd assembled and collected As were a war in expectation Therefore I say 'tis meet we all go forth To view the sick and feeble parts of France And let us do it with no show of fear No with no more than if we heard that England Were busied with a Whitsun morrisdance For my good liege she is so idly king'd Her sceptre so fantastically borne By a vain giddy shallow humorous youth That fear attends her notO peace Prince Dauphin You are too much mistaken in this king Question your Grace the late ambassadors With what great state he heard their embassy How well supplied with noble counsellors How modest in exception and withal How terrible in constant resolution And you shall find his vanities forespent Were but the outside of the Roman Brutus Covering discretion with a coat of folly As gardeners do with ordure hide those roots That shall first spring and be most delicateWell 'tis not so my Lord High Constable But though we think it so it is no matter In cases of defence 'tis best to weigh The enemy more mighty than he seems So the proportions of defence are fill'd Which of a weak and niggardly projection Doth like a miser spoil his coat with scanting A little clothThink we King Harry strong And Princes look you strongly arm to meet him The kindred of him hath been flesh'd upon us And he is bred out of that bloody strain That haunted us in our familiar paths Witness our too much memorable shame When Cressy battle fatally was struck And all our princes capdv'd by the hand Of that black name Edward Black Prince of Wales Whiles that his mountain sire on mountain standing Up in the air crown'd with the golden sun Saw his heroical seed and smil'd to see him Mangle the work of nature and deface The patterns that by God and by French fathers Had twenty years been made This is a stern Of that victorious stock and let us fear The native mightiness and fate of hima Ambassadors from Harry King of England Do crave admittance to your MajestyWe'll

sinister nor no awkward claim Pick'd from the wormholes of longvanish'd days Nor from the dust of old oblivion rak'd He sends you this most memorable line Gives a paper In every branch truly demonstrative Willing you overlook this pedigree And when you find him evenly deriv'd From his most fam'd of famous ancestors Edward the Third he bids you then resign Your crown and kingdom indirectly held From him the native and true challengerOr else what followsBloody constraint for if you hide the crown Even in your hearts there will he rake for it Therefore in fierce tempest is he coming In thunder and in earthquake like a Jove That if requiring fail he will compel And bids you in the bowels of the Lord Deliver up the crown and to take mercy On the poor souls for whom this hungry war Opens his vasty jaws and on your head Turning the widows' tears the orphans' cries The dead men's blood the privy maidens' groans For husbands fathers and betrothed lovers That shall be swallowed in

you bear our full intent Back to our brother of EnglandFor the Dauphin I stand here for him What to him from EnglandScorn and defiance slight regard contempt And anything that may not misbecome The mighty sender doth he prize you at Thus says my king an if your father's Highness Do not in grant of all demands at large Sweeten the bitter mock you sent his Majesty He'll call you to so hot an answer of it That caves and womby vaultages of France Shall chide your trespass and return your mock In second accent of his ordinanceSay if my father render fair return It is against my will for I

mighty Europe And be assur'd you'll find a difference As we his subjects have in wonder found Between the promise of his greener days And these he masters now Now he weighs time Even to the utmost grain that you shall read In your own losses if he stay in FranceTomorrow shall you know our mind at fullDispatch us with all speed lest that our king Come here himself to question our delay For he is
